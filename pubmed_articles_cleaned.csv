Aging as disease.,Gunnar De Winter,"In this paper, I will argue that ageing can be construed as disease. First, the concept of disease is discussed, where the distinction is made between two lines of thought, an objectivist and a subjectivist one. After determining the disease conception to be used throughout the argument, it is proposed that senescence could be seen as disease. Three common counterarguments are discussed, none of which appears strong enough to effectively counter the advocated view. In the third section, two potential implications of the view advocated here will be briefly touched upon. These are the quest for a cure or treatment for ageing and the general attitude towards the elderly. It is concluded that, utilizing an objective disease concept, ageing could be seen as a disease. None of the considered counterarguments packs enough of a punch to discard this. The implications are complex and intertwined, but need not be negative.",,"Medicine, Health Care, And Philosophy",no keywords,"adaptation, psychological, aging, disease, humans, medicalization, philosophy, medical",10.1007/s11019-014-9600-y,"Department of Philosophy, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK, gunnardewinter.2011@my.bristol.ac.uk."

Scientific Papers and Patents on Substances with Unproven Effects.,Sergei V Jargin,"It is evident from reviewing scientific literature that the quality of argumentation in some areas of medical research has deteriorated during the last decades. Publication of a series of questionable reliability has continued without making references to the published criticism; examples are discussed in this review. Another tendency is that drugs without proven efficiency are advertised, corresponding products patented and marketed as evidence-based medications. Professional publications are required to register drugs and dietary supplements to obtain permissions for the practical use; and such papers appeared, sometimes being of questionable reliability. Several examples are discussed in this review when substances without proven effects were patented and introduced into practice being supported by publications of questionable reliability. Some of the topics are not entirely clear; and the arguments provided here can induce a constructive discussion.",,Recent Patents On Drug Delivery & Formulation,"placebo, antioxidants, atherosclerosis, cardiovascular, dietary supplements, hormesis.","antioxidants, dietary supplements, evidence-based medicine, humans, patents as topic, periodicals as topic, pharmaceutical preparations, treatment outcome",10.2174/1872211313666190307162041,"Peoples' Friendship University of Russia, Clementovski per 6-82, 115184 Moscow, Russian Federation."
Advances in Paper-Based Analytical Devices.,"Tugba Ozer, Catherine Mcmahon, Charles S Henry","Microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (μPADs) are the newest generation of lab-on-a-chip devices and have made significant strides in both our understanding of fundamental behavior and performance characteristics and expansion of their applications. μPADs have become useful analytical techniques for environmental analysis in addition to their more common application as medical point-of-care devices. Although the most common method for device fabrication is wax printing, numerous other techniques exist and have helped address factors ranging from solvent compatibility to improved device function. This review highlights recent reports of fabrication and design, modes of detection, and broad applications of μPADs. Such advances have enabled μPADs to be used in field and laboratory studies to address critical needs in fast, cheaper measurement technologies.",2020-01-01,"Annual Review Of Analytical Chemistry (Palo Alto, Calif.)","biomedical diagnostics, biosensors, environmental, microfluidics, paper-based","lab-on-a-chip devices, paper, point-of-care systems",10.1146/annurev-anchem-061318-114845,"Department of Chemistry, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado 80526, USA; email: Chuck.Henry@colostate.edu., Department of Chemistry, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado 80526, USA; email: Chuck.Henry@colostate.edu., Department of Chemistry, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado 80526, USA; email: Chuck.Henry@colostate.edu."
"Is non-medical use normal? Normalisation, medicalisation and pharmaceutical consumption.",George Christopher Dertadian,"The theory of the normalisation of youth drug use in advanced capitalist societies has had an enduring legacy in contemporary drug scholarship. While the literature on the normalisation of 'illicit' drugs is well developed, less has been written about application of the theory to emerging discourse of pharmaceutical 'abuse', and how this might necessitate different thinking around what can be considered normal consumption. Pharmaceuticals are not directly associated with criminality, and their use does not traditionally attract stigma. In fact, social science scholarship has illustrated how many substances deemed illicit are normalised in the context of an ever-growing set of medical treatments. This paper explores the assumptions about legality, sociality and pleasure which sit behind the drug normalisation thesis, by reflecting on the relevance of drug normalisation in relation to pharmaceuticals, as well as examining scholarship on the medicalisation of society and qualitative research on non-medical use to illustrate the parallel processes of normalisation that apply to pharmaceuticals. The paper argues that questions of normalisation in relation to pharmaceutical use require a deeper engagement with the normative expectations we attach to pleasure, consumption and medicine, and the way this is structured by proximity to medical authority, whiteness and middle-classness.",2023-01-01,The International Journal On Drug Policy,"medicalisation, middle-class, non-medical use, normalisation, pharmaceuticalisation, pharmaceuticals, white, youth","adolescent, humans, illicit drugs, social behavior, pleasure, qualitative research, medicalization",10.1016/j.drugpo.2023.104123,"Centre for Crime, Law and Justice, Faculty of Law and Justice, UNSW, Sydney, Australia.

Drug interactions of cola-containing drinks.,"Homa Nomani, Ali Tafazoli Moghadam, Seyed Ahmad Emami, Amir Hooshang Mohammadpour, Thomas P Johnston, Amirhossein Sahebkar","Cola-containing drinks (CCDs) are among the most common drinks in the world. There are some reports on interactions between CCDs and some drugs. However, there is no review on reported and possible interactions of CCDs. Thus, this paper attempted to provide a comprehensive review on this subject. It is well-accepted that CCDs are acidic and contain caffeine. It has been suggested that these two properties potentiate interactions of CCDs with different drugs in the context of both pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic, which includes drug absorption, metabolism, and renal excretion of drugs. It has been shown that serum concentrations of MTX, clozapine, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and ibuprofen increased following CCD consumption; these interactions can be toxic. Additionally, it has been reported that serum levels of lithium and warfarin were decreased and their efficacy reduced when simultaneously administered with CCDs. Serum concentrations of erlotinib and different azoles, including itraconazol, posaconazole, and ketoconazole, have been shown to increase when these drugs were co-administered with a CCD. As proposed and discussed here, CCDs have the potential for interactions with numerous other drugs and thus clinicians should be aware of reported and potential interactions of CCDs with various medications in order to avoid adverse reactions and achieve expected clinical response.",2019-01-01,"Clinical Nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)","cola-containing drinks, drug interactions, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics","animals, biomedical research, carbonated beverages, cola, drug interactions, humans, pharmaceutical preparations",10.1016/j.clnu.2019.01.029,"School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran., Clinical Pharmacy Department, School of Pharmacy, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Iran., Department of Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran., Department of Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran; Pharmaceutical Research Center, Pharmaceutical Technology Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.

Stratified medicalization of schooling difficulties.,Rachel Elizabeth Fish,"Medicalization is a central topic of concern in the sociology of disability and of health and illness. In this paper, I examine how medicalization is inequitably applied and circulates in the context of schools, specifically in serving students with educational disabilities. My aim is to advance understandings of medicalization through this case. Using a mixed-methods design, I first show, descriptively, how race and gender intersectionally predict educational disability status in a dataset of all Wisconsin public school students. Next, I examine how racial and gender disparities in disability status are produced at the micro level, using interviews with 27 Wisconsin teachers, including in-depth discussions of 73 individual students that were struggling academically or behaviorally. My quantitative findings show variation by race, gender, and disability category: White children have higher probability of special education receipt than comparable children of color for academic difficulties, but lower probability for behavioral difficulties, and girls have lower probability than comparable boys overall. My interview data suggest that these disparate outcomes reflect stratified medicalization processes, in which institutional constraints, status beliefs, and cultural discourses of race and gender shape both stratified noticing of schooling difficulties and stratified interpretation of those difficulties as medicalized conditions.",2022-01-01,Social Science & Medicine (1982),"disability, education, gender, medicalization, mixed-methods, race","child, cognition, educational status, female, humans, male, medicalization, schools, students",10.1016/j.socscimed.2022.115039,"New York University, USA.

Tablets made from paper.,"Florian Stumpf, Cornelia M Keck","The possibility to compress ordinary paper into tablets was systematically investigated in this study. Results proved that tablets can be made from paper, independent of the type of paper used. The tablets appear shiny and with a smooth surface. The pharmaceutical quality was acceptable, i.e. all tablets fulfilled the requirements for tablets according to the European Pharmacopeia. Drug-loaded tablets were produced by compression of drug-loaded paper. Drug loading did not alter the pharmaceutical quality. However, the uncoated tablets possessed an extremely fast disintegration, i.e. intense swelling upon contact with water, which might hamper the swallowing after oral administration. To avoid swelling tablets were successfully coated with a polymer film, leading to a prevention of swelling but immediate disintegration in simulated gastric fluid. In fact, tablets made from paper are a novel and promising strategy for improved oral drug delivery. They can be easily produced without any further excipients and possess pharmaceutical quality according to the European Pharmacopeia.",2018-01-01,International Journal Of Pharmaceutics,"drug release, individualized therapy, oral drug delivery, paper, poorly soluble apis, tablets, tissue","chemistry, pharmaceutical, drug liberation, paper, tablets",10.1016/j.ijpharm.2018.05.071,"Department of Pharmaceutics and Biopharmaceutics, Philipps-Universität Marburg, Marburg, Germany., Department of Pharmaceutics and Biopharmaceutics, Philipps-Universität Marburg, Marburg, Germany.

The concept of medicalisation reassessed.,Joan Busfield,"Medicalisation has been an important concept in sociological discussions of medicine since its adoption by medical sociologists in the early 1970s. Yet it has been criticised by some sociologists, in part because it seems too negative about medicine, and modified or replaced by others with concepts deemed more relevant like biomedicalisation and pharmaceuticalisation. My aim in this paper is to reassess the concept and consider whether it still has value in exploring significant aspects of the role of medicine in present-day society. I start with an archaeology of the concept's development and the different ways it has been used. This covers some familiar ground but is essential to the main task: examining criticisms of the concept and assessing its value.

It is thus crucial to gain an understanding of how drug solubility/permeability, drug formulations and routes of administration affect in vivo behaviors of drug deposition. This review examines literature reports on the drug deposition in tissues and cells of poorly water-soluble drugs, as well as underlying physical mechanisms that lead to precipitation. Our work particularly highlights drug deposition in macrophages and the subcellular fate of precipitated drugs. We also propose a tissue permeability-based classification framework to evaluate precipitation potentials of poorly soluble drugs in major organs and tissues.

Modular design principle based on compartmental drug delivery systems.,"Georgios K Eleftheriadis, Natalja Genina, Johan Boetker, Jukka Rantanen","The current manufacturing solutions for oral solid dosage forms are fundamentally based on technologies from the 19th century. This approach is well suited for mass production of one-size-fits-all products; however, it does not allow for a straight-forward personalization and mass customization of the pharmaceutical end-product. In order to provide better therapies to the patients, a need for innovative manufacturing concepts and product design principles has been rising. Additive manufacturing opens up a possibility for compartmentalization of drug products, including design of spatially separated multidrug and functional excipient compartments. This compartmentalized solution can be further expanded to modular design thinking. Modular design is referring to combination of building blocks containing a given amount of drug compound(s) and related functional excipients into a larger final product. Implementation of modular design principles is paving the way for implementing the emerging personalization potential within health sciences by designing compartmental and reactive product structures that can be manufactured based on the individual needs of each patient.

Therapeutic management in the low-wage workplace.,Emily H Ruppel,"Medicalization represents an increasingly significant form of social control. Emergent evidence suggests that workplace managers take up medicalized practices and discourses to produce a compliant labor force, but this phenomenon has received limited sociological attention. This paper extends prior theories of medicalization to investigate therapeutic management in the low-wage workplace. I draw upon eight months of ethnographic fieldwork in Disability Works, a nonprofit job training program for people with mental illnesses, and interviews with other providers and advocates within this field. Disability Works harnesses therapy, psychiatry, and ""softer"" therapeutic practices such as mindfulness meditation, sleep hygiene, and positive affirmations to produce its workforce. This paper identifies two dimensions of therapeutic management: (1) it aims to inculcate work norms at the level of client-workers' embodied dispositions, and (2) it aims to transform structural problems into individual ones.

Should UK based Physiotherapists Choose Wisely?,Graham Copnell,"In 2012 the Choose Wisely campaign was launched in the United States in order to address concerns regarding medicalisation, over diagnosis and medical consumerism. The campaign has now spread internationally and includes a number of countries including Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Germany. The primary aim of the campaign is to facilitate healthcare professionals and patients to question the overall utility of medical interventions. Professionals through their professional organisations identify at least five commonly used interventions or tests, within their areas of speciality, which they feel provided no or little benefit to patients. This paper provides the background to the Choose Wisely campaign. The paper reviews the concepts of medicalisation, over diagnosis and medical consumerism, before considering the utility of the campaign in the UK alongside other forms of governance such as NICE.

Paper-Based Fluidic Sensing Platforms for β-Adrenergic Agonist Residue Point-of-Care Testing.,"Hongzhi Luo, Shan Liu, Lina Shi, Zhu Li, Qianwen Bai, Xiaoxin Du, Lijun Wang, He Zha, Chenzhong Li","The illegal use of β-adrenergic agonists during livestock growth poses a threat to public health; the long-term intake of this medication can cause serious physiological side effects and even death. Therefore, rapid detection methods for β-adrenergic agonist residues on-site are required. Traditional detection methods such as liquid chromatography have limitations in terms of expensive instruments and complex operations. In contrast, paper methods are low cost, ubiquitous, and portable, which has led to them becoming the preferred detection method in recent years. Various paper-based fluidic devices have been developed to detect β-adrenergic agonist residues, including lateral flow immunoassays (LFAs) and microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (μPADs). In this review, the application of LFAs for the detection of β-agonists is summarized comprehensively, focusing on the latest advances in novel labeling and detection strategies. The use of μPADs as an analytical platform has attracted interest over the past decade due to their unique advantages and application for detecting β-adrenergic agonists, which are introduced here. Vertical flow immunoassays are also discussed for their shorter assay time and stronger multiplexing capabilities compared with LFAs. Furthermore, the development direction and prospects for the commercialization of paper-based devices are considered, shedding light on the development of point-of-care testing devices for β-adrenergic agonist residue detection.",2022-01-01,Biosensors,"biosensors, lateral flow immunoassay, microfluidics, paper-based device, point-of-care testing, β-adrenergic agonists","adrenergic beta-agonists, immunoassay, lab-on-a-chip devices, microfluidic analytical techniques, paper, point-of-care systems, point-of-care testing",518,"Department of Laboratory Medicine, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University (The First People's Hospital of Zunyi), Zunyi 563002, China., Sichuan Provincial Key Laboratory for Human Disease Gene Study, Department of Medical Genetics, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences & Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu 610072, China., School of Medicine, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu 610054, China., College of Medical Technology, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu 610075, China., Sichuan Jinxin Women & Children Hospital, Chengdu 610066, China., Office of Scientific Research & Development, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu 610054, China., Department of Ophthalmology, The Third People's Hospital of Chengdu, The Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu 610031, China., Department of Laboratory Medicine, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University (The First People's Hospital of Zunyi), Zunyi 563002, China., Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Medicine, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA 70112, USA."
Controlling Fluorescent Readout in Paper-based Analytical Devices.,"Anna Luongo, Alexander Ritter Von Stockert, Frank D Scherag, Thomas Brandstetter, Markus Biesalski, Jürgen Rühe","Paper is an ideal candidate for the development of new disposable diagnostic devices because it is a low-cost material, allows transport of the liquid on the device by capillary action, and is environmentally friendly. Today, colorimetric analysis is most often used as a detection method for rapid tests (test strips or lateral flow devices) but usually gives only qualitative results and is limited by a relatively high detection threshold. Here, we describe studies using fluorescence as a readout tool for paper-based diagnostics. We study how the optical readout is affected by light transmission, scattering, and fluorescence as a function of paper characteristics such as thickness (grammage), water content, autofluorescence, and paper type/composition. We show that paper-based fluorescence analysis allows better optical readout compared to that of nitrocellulose, which is currently the material of choice in colorimetric assays. To reduce the loss of analyte molecules (e.g., proteins) due to adsorption to the paper surface, we coat the paper fibers with a protein-repellent hydrogel. For this purpose, we use hydrophilic copolymers consisting of <i>N</i>,<i>N</i>-dimethyl acrylamide and a benzophenone-based cross-linker, which are photochemically transformed into a fiber-attached polymer hydrogel on the paper fiber surfaces in situ. We show that the combination of fluorescence detection and the use of a protein-repellent coating enables sensitive paper-based analysis.

A critique of medicalisation: three instances.,Sonia Ryang,"By briefly exploring three different examples where the existence of mental illness and developmental delay has been presumed, this paper sheds light on the way what Foucault calls the emergence of a regime of truth, i.e. where something that does not exist is made to exist through the construction of a system of truth around it. The first example concerns the direct marketing of pharmaceutical products to consumers in the US, the second the use of psychology in semi-post-Cold War Korea, and the third the persisting authority of psychology in the treatment of the developmentally delayed. While these instances are not innately connected, looking at these as part of the process by which the authoritative knowledge is established will help us understand, albeit partially, the mechanism by which mental illness penetrates our lives as truth, and how this regime of truth is supported by the authority of psychology, psychiatry and psychoanalysis, what Foucault calls the 'psy-function,' reinforcing the medicalisation of our lives.",,Anthropology & Medicine,"foucault, psy-function, mental illness, truth","anthropology, medical, direct-to-consumer advertising, humans, medicalization, mental disorders, psychiatry, psychometrics, psychotropic drugs",10.1080/13648470.2017.1389169,"a Chao Center for Asian Studies , Rice University , Houston , TX , USA."

Stability and compatibility of parenteral nutrition solutions; a review of influencing factors.,"Mahmoud Farhan, Naomi Mccallion, Joanne Bennett, Anne Cram, Fiona O'Brien","Both stability and compatibility of parenteral nutrition solutions (PNS) with drug products are major concerns for clinicians and clinical pharmacists, especially when concurrent administration of PNS with intravenous medications (IVM) is unavoidable. Since the same physicochemical principles apply to both adult's and paediatrics' PNS, concerns about stability and compatibility may still apply to both. However, these concerns are relatively more common in paediatrics and neonatal clinical settings, where limited vascular access can be problematic and the coadministration of PNS and drugs is more common. In neonatal and paediatric populations, there have been few experimental studies and comprehensive evaluations looking at medication compatibility with frequently used PNS. This work is part of a larger research project concerned for compatibility of PNS with commonly used intravenous medication in paediatric and neonates. This paper captures and reviews published data on factors influencing stability and compatibility of parenteral nutrition solutions. This information will help clinicians and clinical pharmacists to understand the principals of the stability and compatibility of PNS, furthermore, it will inform better design of future compatibility studies, as it highlights the complexity of PNS and the multiple factors influencing the stability of PNS, and hence its compatibility with IVM. When preparing, prescribing, and administering the PNS, especially when co-administration with IVM is unavoidable, it is important to take into account the physicochemical properties of the PNS components and IVM as well as administration conditions and environmental factors. These factors should also be considered in the design of the compatibility studies of the PNS with the IVM.",2023-01-01,European Journal Of Pharmaceutics And Biopharmaceutics : Official Journal Of Arbeitsgemeinschaft Fur Pharmazeutische Verfahrenstechnik E.V,"amino acids, compatibility, glucose, intravenous medication, lipid, parenteral nutrition solutions, stability","infant, newborn, humans, child, parenteral nutrition solutions, pharmaceutical preparations, drug stability",10.1016/j.ejpb.2023.04.002,"School of Postgraduate Studies, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Dublin, Ireland.

Reducing Unspecific Protein Adsorption in Microfluidic Papers Using Fiber-Attached Polymer Hydrogels.,"Alexander Ritter Von Stockert, Anna Luongo, Markus Langhans, Thomas Brandstetter, Jürgen Rühe, Tobias Meckel, Markus Biesalski","Microfluidic paper combines pump-free water transport at low cost with a high degree of sustainability, as well as good availability of the paper-forming cellulosic material, thus making it an attractive candidate for point-of-care (POC) analytics and diagnostics. Although a number of interesting demonstrators for such paper devices have been reported to date, a number of challenges still exist, which limit a successful transfer into marketable applications. A strong limitation in this respect is the (unspecific) adsorption of protein analytes to the paper fibers during the lateral flow assay. This interaction may significantly reduce the amount of analyte that reaches the detection zone of the microfluidic paper-based analytical device (µPAD), thereby reducing its overall sensitivity. Here, we introduce a novel approach on reducing the nonspecific adsorption of proteins to lab-made paper sheets for the use in µPADs. To this, cotton linter fibers in lab-formed additive-free paper sheets are modified with a surrounding thin hydrogel layer generated from photo-crosslinked, benzophenone functionalized copolymers based on poly-(oligo-ethylene glycol methacrylate) (POEGMA) and poly-dimethyl acrylamide (PDMAA). This, as we show in tests similar to lateral flow assays, significantly reduces unspecific binding of model proteins. Furthermore, by evaporating the transport fluid during the microfluidic run at the end of the paper strip through local heating, model proteins can almost quantitatively be accumulated in that zone. The possibility of complete, almost quantitative protein transport in a µPAD opens up new opportunities to significantly improve the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of paper-based lateral flow assays.",2021-01-01,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)","poc, cellulose, entropic shielding, microfluidics, protein binding, surface functionalization, µpad","adsorption, hydrogels, microfluidics, paper, polymers",6348,"Laboratory of Macromolecular Chemistry and Paper Chemistry (MAP), Department of Chemistry, Technische Universität Darmstadt, 64287 Darmstadt, Germany., Laboratory of Chemistry and Physics of Interfaces, Institute for Microsystems Technology, Technical Faculty, University of Freiburg, 79110 Freiburg, Germany., Laboratory of Macromolecular Chemistry and Paper Chemistry (MAP), Department of Chemistry, Technische Universität Darmstadt, 64287 Darmstadt, Germany., Laboratory of Chemistry and Physics of Interfaces, Institute for Microsystems Technology, Technical Faculty, University of Freiburg, 79110 Freiburg, Germany., Laboratory of Chemistry and Physics of Interfaces, Institute for Microsystems Technology, Technical Faculty, University of Freiburg, 79110 Freiburg, Germany., Laboratory of Macromolecular Chemistry and Paper Chemistry (MAP), Department of Chemistry, Technische Universität Darmstadt, 64287 Darmstadt, Germany., Laboratory of Macromolecular Chemistry and Paper Chemistry (MAP), Department of Chemistry, Technische Universität Darmstadt, 64287 Darmstadt, Germany."
"Medicalisation, pharmaceuticalisation, or both? Exploring the medical management of sleeplessness as insomnia.","Catherine Coveney, Simon J Williams, Jonathan Gabe","In this paper we examine the medical management of sleeplessness as 'insomnia', through the eyes of general practitioners (GPs) and sleep experts in Britain. Three key themes were evident in the data. These related to (i) institutional issues around advocacy and training in sleep medicine (ii) conceptual issues in the diagnosis of insomnia (iii) and how these played out in terms of treatment issues. As a result, the bulk of medical management occurred at the primary rather than secondary care level. These issues are then reflected on in terms of the light they shed on relations between the medicalisation and the pharmaceuticalisation of sleeplessness as insomnia. Sleeplessness, we suggest, is only partially and problematically medicalised as insomnia to date at the conceptual, institutional and interactional levels owing to the foregoing factors. Much of this moreover, on closer inspection, is arguably better captured through recourse to pharmaceuticalisation, including countervailing moves and downward regulatory pressures which suggest a possible degree of depharmaceuticalisation in future, at least as far prescription hypnotics are concerned. Pharmaceuticalisation therefore, we conclude, has distinct analytical value in directing our attention, in this particular case, to important dynamics occurring within if not beyond the medicalisation of sleeplessness as insomnia.",2018-01-01,Sociology Of Health & Illness,"drugs/medication, interviewing (qualitative), medical knowledge, medicalisation, primary care, sleep","attitude of health personnel, female, general practitioners, humans, hypnotics and sedatives, male, medicalization, prescription drugs, sleep initiation and maintenance disorders, united kingdom",10.1111/1467-9566.12820,"School of Applied Social Sciences, De Montfort University, Leicester, UK., Department of Sociology, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK., Criminology & Sociology, School of Law, Royal Holloway, Egham, UK."
"Medical diagnosis of dyslexia in a Swedish elite school: A case of ""consecrating medicalization"".",Mikael Holmqvist,"Based on qualitative data of an upper-secondary school in Sweden's primary elite community, Djursholm, I propose how medical diagnosis of students as dyslexics contributes to consecrating them by offering a short cut to successful performance, while at the same time reproducing differences between social classes. The study suggests how students that do not score top can be labeled dyslexic and the social and moral consequences of that. I introduce the concept of ""consecrating medicalization"" in order to discriminate between the effects of medical diagnosis of members of different social classes.

The medico-legal significance of pharmacokinetic interactions with ethanol.,"N J Langford, R E Ferner","In the UK, the maximal permitted ethanol concentration for driving is 80 mg ethanol/100 mL blood, 35 μg ethanol/100 mL breath or 107 mg ethanol/100 mL urine. Drivers exceeding the prescribed limit face severe penalties, which they are often anxious to avoid, either by acquittal or by putting forward 'special reasons' why they should not be disqualified from driving. One frequently explored defence is that the accused was taking prescribed medication. Defence solicitors often ask the question whether the prescribed medication could have caused significantly altered blood ethanol concentrations.

Deficiencies were identified in medication management in operating theatres (OT) at a large tertiary hospital. A perioperative pharmacist was employed for a 6-month pilot period, with permanent funding dependent on demonstration of agreed economic benefits. A multidisciplinary committee set goals, drove strategic initiatives and was accountable for delivery of outcomes. Pharmaceutical expenditure was analysed and high expenditure items targeted. Cost savings and staff satisfaction were measured at 6 months. Savings of A$63884 were achieved during the pilot period, resulting from optimised pharmaceutical unit pricing, OT medication stock on hand (imprest) review and redesigned medication management strategies. Improvements in medication management included better access to medications in the OT, rationalising available products to minimise wastage and implementation of guidelines and protocols for high-cost and high-risk medications. At 6 months, 97% of theatre staff supported continuation of the role; the project was extended with demonstrated cost savings of A$157265 at 12 months.

Comprehensive Review on Drug-target Interaction Prediction - Latest Developments and Overview.,"Ali K Abdul Raheem, Ban N Dhannoon","Drug-target interactions (DTIs) are an important part of the drug development process. When the drug (a chemical molecule) binds to a target (proteins or nucleic acids), it modulates the biological behavior/function of the target, returning it to its normal state. Predicting DTIs plays a vital role in the drug discovery (DD) process as it has the potential to enhance efficiency and reduce costs. However, DTI prediction poses significant challenges and expenses due to the time-consuming and costly nature of experimental assays. As a result, researchers have increased their efforts to identify the association between medications and targets in the hopes of speeding up drug development and shortening the time to market. This paper provides a detailed discussion of the initial stage in drug discovery, namely drug-target interactions. It focuses on exploring the application of machine learning methods within this step. Additionally, we aim to conduct a comprehensive review of relevant papers and databases utilized in this field. Drug target interaction prediction covers a wide range of applications: drug discovery, prediction of adverse effects and drug repositioning.

Achievements in robotic automation of solvent extraction and related approaches for bioanalysis of pharmaceuticals.,"Michal Alexovič, Yannis Dotsikas, Peter Bober, Ján Sabo","Currently, the growing demand on quick, easy and ecological sample pretreatment methods is unquestionable. Such challenge involves also approaches focusing on the analysis of pharmaceuticals and other endogenous compounds in biological matrices, termed as Bioanalysis. Solvent extraction such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), derived liquid phase microextraction (LPME) and related approaches such as solid liquid extraction (SLE), proved to be applicable in bioanalysis, as numerous papers have been published in this field. However, their manual performances may suffer from a long-term and laborious preparation, due to the inherent complexity of the biological samples. A high sample-throughput (enabling measurement of tens or hundreds of samples on a daily basis) can be achieved when automation of sample pretreatment is performed, resulting in decreased imprecision and low waste production of hazardous solvents and risky biological materials. Here, robotic systems have a key role, especially when multiple processing (e.g., 96-well plate format) and coupling to modern analytical instrumentation (e.g. LC-MS) are combined. A thorough overview on the up-to-date automations of LLE, LPME, SLE and solid LLE via robotics, is therefore presented.

The potential of three-dimensional printing for pediatric oral solid dosage forms.,"Klemen Kreft, Marina Fanous, Volker Möckel","Pediatric patients often require individualized dosing of medicine due to their unique pharmacokinetic and developmental characteristics. Current methods for tailoring the dose of pediatric medications, such as tablet splitting or compounding liquid formulations, have limitations in terms of dosing accuracy and palatability. This paper explores the potential of 3D printing as a solution to address the challenges and provide tailored doses of medication for each pediatric patient. The technological overview of 3D printing is discussed, highlighting various 3D printing technologies and their suitability for pharmaceutical applications. Several individualization options with the potential to improve adherence are discussed, such as individualized dosage, custom release kinetics, tablet shape, and palatability. To integrate the preparation of 3D printed medication at the point of care, a decentralized manufacturing model is proposed.

Emerging applications of paper-based analytical devices for drug analysis: A review.,"Eka Noviana, Daniel Blascke Carrão, Rimadani Pratiwi, Charles S Henry",The use of paper microfluidics to perform chemical measurements for various analytical applications has gained interest over the last decade. One of the growing applications of these platforms is for the qualitative and quantitative determination of drugs. The low cost and self-pumping ability of paper microfluidics are attractive for developing analytical tools capable of on-site drug screening. This review aims to present the unique features of microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (μPADs) that offer advantages to pharmaceutical analysis and evaluate the state-of-the-art technologies and applications of the platform for drug analysis in research and real-world settings.

Drug Contamination of U.S. Paper Currency and Forensic Relevance of Canine Alert to Paper Currency: A Critical Review of the Scientific Literature.,"Jay M Poupko, William Lee Hearn, Federico Rossano","Several studies have reported on wide-spread contamination of U.S. paper currency with cocaine and to a lesser extent other illicit drugs. Canines are trained and employed to search for and alert to drugs. Canine alert to currency has been used as evidence that currency has been directly involved in illicit drug trafficking to justify currency seizure and forfeiture. This assertion, particularly when the only evidence is based upon canine alert, has been challenged in the courts considering that most currency in circulation is contaminated with cocaine. Comprehensive review of the scientific literature establishes that (i) 67-100% of circulated U.S. currency is contaminated with cocaine ranging from a few nanograms to over one milligram/bill (ii) various biological and environmental parameters impact canine alert to drugs.

Love and romantic relationship in the domain of medicine.,Chrysogonus M Okwenna,"In this paper, I explore the nature of medical interventions like neuromodulation on the complex human experience of love. Love is built upon two fundamental natures, viz: the biological and the psychosocial. As a result of this distinction, scientists, and bioethicists have been exploring the possible ways this complex human experience can be biologically tampered with to produce some supposed higher-order ends like well-being and human flourishing. At the forefront in this quest are Earp, Sandberg and Savulescu whose research works over ten years has focused on the good that could stem from the medicalization of love. I acknowledge the various criticisms that have been made against this stance. However, most of these criticisms have been directed towards the mere side effects and sociocultural disservices that could result from the process of using drugs to influence human romantic relationships and in the end, critiques endorse the medicalization of love on the basis that its benefits outweigh the disadvantages. Consequently, I advance two strands of arguments against ""medically-assisted love,"" the ontological and the socio-ethical arguments. The former presupposes that beyond the possible side effects of medicalizing love there is something inherently mistaken about this effort and there is something intrinsically different about love that distinguishes it from its medically-engineered alternative. In the latter argument, I claim that drug interventions in romantic love contravene the very nature of medicine. Overall, I believe that critiques were still able to endorse medicalizing love despite their objections because they were only looking at one direction, the physical/cultural complications.",2022-01-01,"Medicine, Health Care, And Philosophy","biology, love, medical interventions, medicine, ontology","humans, love, dissent and disputes, medicalization, interpersonal relations",10.1007/s11019-022-10127-7,"Department of Philosophy, Simon Fraser University, West Mall Centre, 8888 University Dr., Burnaby, BC, V5A 1S6, Canada.

Pharmaceutical approaches for enhancing solubility and oral bioavailability of poorly soluble drugs.,"Isaïe Nyamba, Charles B Sombié, Moussa Yabré, Hermine Zimé-Diawara, Josias Yaméogo, Salfo Ouédraogo, Anna Lechanteur, Rasmané Semdé, Brigitte Evrard","High solubility in water and physiological fluids is an indispensable requirement for the pharmacological efficacy of an active pharmaceutical ingredient. Indeed, it is well established that pharmaceutical substances exhibiting limited solubility in water are inclined towards diminished and inconsistent absorption following oral administration, consequently resulting in variability in therapeutic outcomes. The current advancements in combinatorial chemistry and pharmaceutical design have facilitated the creation of drug candidates characterized by increased lipophilicity, elevated molecular size, and reduced aqueous solubility. Undoubtedly, the issue of poorly water-soluble medications has been progressively escalating over recent years. Indeed, 40% of the top 200 oral medications marketed in the United States, 33% of drugs listed in the US pharmacopoeia, 75% of compounds under development and 90% of new chemical entities are insufficiently water-soluble compounds. In order to address this obstacle, formulation scientists employ a variety of approaches, encompassing both physical and chemical methods such as prodrug synthesis, salt formation, solid dispersions formation, hydrotropic substances utilization, solubilizing agents incorporation, cosolvent addition, polymorphism exploration, cocrystal creation, cyclodextrins complexation, lipid formulations, particle size reduction and nanoformulation techniques. Despite the utilization of these diverse approaches, the primary reason for the failure in new drug development persists as the poor aqueous solubility of pharmaceutical compounds. This paper, therefore, delves into the foundational principles that underpin the implementation of various formulation strategies, along with a discussion on the respective advantages and drawbacks associated with each approach. Additionally, a discourse is provided regarding methodological frameworks for making informed decisions on selecting an appropriate formulation strategy to effectively tackle the key challenges posed during the development of a poorly water-soluble drug candidate.",2024-01-01,European Journal Of Pharmaceutics And Biopharmaceutics : Official Journal Of Arbeitsgemeinschaft Fur Pharmazeutische Verfahrenstechnik E.V,"bioavailability, dissolution rate, formulation, solubility","solubility, administration, oral, biological availability, pharmaceutical preparations, humans, chemistry, pharmaceutical, drug compounding, water, animals",10.1016/j.ejpb.2024.114513,"Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Technology and Biopharmacy, CIRM, Université de Liège, 4000 Liège, Belgium; Laboratory of Drug Development, Center of Training, Research and Expertise in Pharmaceutical Sciences (CFOREM), Doctoral School of Sciences and Health, Université Joseph KI-ZERBO, 03 BP 7021 Ouagadougou 03, Burkina Faso; Institut Supérieur des Sciences de la Santé (INSSA), Université Nazi Boni, 01 BP 1091 Bobo-Dioulasso 01, Burkina Faso.

Embracing and rejecting the medicalization of autism in Italy.,"Alice Scavarda, M Ariel Cascio","Medicalization is increasingly recognized as a bidirectional process, with patients and their families as agents. The paper considers the specific case of the medicalization of autism in Italy, from the point of view of parents of autistic people with different levels of support needs. Through reporting and comparing results of two independently conducted qualitative studies, this paper aims to analyze how parents embrace and resist the medicalization of autism in their everyday lives and in healthcare contexts. Both studies involved participant-observation with services that targeted autistic people and interviews with parents, professionals, and autistic people. Results show that parents of autistic people both embrace and resist medicalization. While parents (sometimes ambivalently) accept the responsibilization inherent in their engagement with interventions (a sort of ""therapeutization"" of life) and reject lay expertise by deferring to experts' knowledge, they also resist the application of medical labels, language and practices in various ways in their everyday lives. Both embracing and resisting medicalization can be useful for achieving overarching social goals of being a good parent, helping their children, and pursuing respect and social harmony. Medicalization derives not only from the cultural dominance of medical discourses, which seems to incorporate resistance to medicalization stances, but also from the absence of continuity and coordination of services, particularly in the Italian context of public (but increasingly privatizing) health and welfare services.",2022-01-01,Social Science & Medicine (1982),"autism, biological citizenship, medicalization, parents, somatic expertise","autistic disorder, child, humans, language, medicalization, parents, qualitative research",10.1016/j.socscimed.2022.114728,"Università di Torino, Dipartimento di Culture, Politica e Società, Lungo Dora Siena 100/A, 10153, Torino, Italy.

Packaging analysis of counterfeit medicines.,"Klara Dégardin, Aurélie Guillemain, Philippe Klespe, Florine Hindelang, Raphaël Zurbach, Yves Roggo","The authentication of the packaging represents an important step in the investigation of suspected counterfeits of pharmaceutical products. The visual comparison with a retained sample is the first step to detect a counterfeited packaging. Due to the improvement of technologies like printing, the emergence of counterfeits with a better appearance can be observed. Moreover counterfeits are nowadays often a combination of fake and genuine parts that have been manipulated. Authenticating each part of the product is important in the frame of the investigation to understand how the counterfeiters proceed, and which prevention measures should be taken. Lab instruments like spectrometers can help confirm counterfeits of packaging for packaging components on which visually, no difference with a reference would be observed. In this study several analytical tools were evaluated to help support the authentication of the primary and secondary packaging of one medicinal product as an example using seven reference materials and five counterfeits. In some cases, visual examination of the packaging already enabled to detect counterfeits of the studied features. Also the boxes, leaflets and vials have been analysed with Infrared (IR) spectroscopy, Raman microspectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and microcomputed tomography (microCT).

"The risk of corruption in public pharmaceutical procurement: how anti-corruption, transparency and accountability measures may reduce this risk.","Jillian Clare Kohler, Deirdre Dimancesco","<b>Background</b>: The goal of the public procurement of pharmaceuticals is to purchase sufficient quantities of high-quality pharmaceuticals at cost-effective prices for a given population. This goal can be undercut if corruption infiltrates the procurement process. Good procurement practices can help mitigate the risks of corruption and support equitable access to affordable and high-quality medicines.<b>Objectives</b>: This paper aims to 1) examine manifestations of corruption in the pharmaceutical procurement process and key factors behind them, and 2) identify how to design and implement effective anti-corruption, transparency and accountability mechanisms within this process.<b>Methods</b>: This paper was informed by a narrative literature review from 1996 to the present. The search focused on publications that addressed the issue of pharmaceutical procurement and governance and corruption issues. Our search included peer-reviewed literature, books, grey literature such as working papers, reports published by international organizations and donor agencies, and some media articles. Some documents used in this paper were already known to the authors.<b>Results</b>: Procurement is highly vulnerable to corruption particularly in the health sector. What is more, corruption in the procurement process does not appear to be limited to any one level of government or type of health system. The better integration of accountability, transparency and anti-corruption mechanisms in the procurement process is needed to reduce the risk of corruption.<b>Conclusions</b>: Lessons learned suggest that anti-corruption, transparency and accountability mechanisms in the pharmaceutical procurement process, such as open contracting and integrity pacts are helpful towards reducing the risk of corruption.",,Global Health Action,"anti-corruption, transparency and accountability, procurement practices, accountability, e-procurement, good governance, health, open contracting, transparency","fraud, government programs, humans, pharmaceutical preparations, social responsibility",1694745,"Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada., Essential Medicines & Health Products Department, World Health Organization (WHO), Geneva, Switzerland."

Materials for microfluidic chip fabrication.,"Kangning Ren, Jianhua Zhou, Hongkai Wu","Through manipulating fluids using microfabricated channel and chamber structures, microfluidics is a powerful tool to realize high sensitive, high speed, high throughput, and low cost analysis. In addition, the method can establish a well-controlled microenivroment for manipulating fluids and particles. It also has rapid growing implementations in both sophisticated chemical/biological analysis and low-cost point-of-care assays. Some unique phenomena emerge at the micrometer scale. For example, reactions are completed in a shorter amount of time as the travel distances of mass and heat are relatively small; the flows are usually laminar; and the capillary effect becomes dominant owing to large surface-to-volume ratios. In the meantime, the surface properties of the device material are greatly amplified, which can lead to either unique functions or problems that we would not encounter at the macroscale. Also, each material inherently corresponds with specific microfabrication strategies and certain native properties of the device. Therefore, the material for making the device plays a dominating role in microfluidic technologies. In this Account, we address the evolution of materials used for fabricating microfluidic chips, and discuss the application-oriented pros and cons of different materials. This Account generally follows the order of the materials introduced to microfluidics. Glass and silicon, the first generation microfluidic device materials, are perfect for capillary electrophoresis and solvent-involved applications but expensive for microfabriaction. Elastomers enable low-cost rapid prototyping and high density integration of valves on chip, allowing complicated and parallel fluid manipulation and in-channel cell culture. Plastics, as competitive alternatives to elastomers, are also rapid and inexpensive to microfabricate. Their broad variety provides flexible choices for different needs. For example, some thermosets support in-situ fabrication of arbitrary 3D structures, while some perfluoropolymers are extremely inert and antifouling. Chemists can use hydrogels as highly permeable structural material, which allows diffusion of molecules without bulk fluid flows. They are used to support 3D cell culture, to form diffusion gradient, and to serve as actuators. Researchers have recently introduced paper-based devices, which are extremely low-cost to prepare and easy to use, thereby promising in commercial point-of-care assays. In general, the evolution of chip materials reflects the two major trends of microfluidic technology: powerful microscale research platforms and low-cost portable analyses. For laboratory research, chemists choosing materials generally need to compromise the ease in prototyping and the performance of the device.

Is Aging a Disease? The Theoretical Definition of Aging in the Light of the Philosophy of Medicine.,"Cristian Saborido, Pablo García-Barranquero","In the philosophical debate on aging, it is common to raise the question of the theoretical definition of aging in terms of its possible characterization as a disease. Understanding aging as a disease seems to imply its medicalization, which has important practical consequences. In this paper, we analyze the question of whether aging is a disease by appealing to the concept of disease in the philosophy of medicine. As a result of this analysis, we argue that a pragmatist approach to the conception of disease is the best alternative to highlight the relevance of the medicalization of aging. From this pragmatist perspective, it can be seen that the notion of aging is going through a conceptual change, and aging can today be understood as a not radically different process from any other condition that is usually considered a disease.",,The Journal Of Medicine And Philosophy,"aging, disease, philosophy of medicine, pragmatism","humans, philosophy, medicalization",10.1093/jmp/jhac030,"UNED, Madrid, Spain., University of Málaga, Málaga, Spain."
Patient Autonomy and Quality of Care in Telehealthcare.,"Giovanni Rubeis, Maximilian Schochow, Florian Steger","Telemedicine is a complex field including various applications and target groups. Especially telehealthcare is seen by many as a means to revolutionize medicine. It gives patients the opportunity to take charge of their own health by using self-tracking devices and allows health professionals to treat patients from a distance. To some, this means an empowerment of patient autonomy as well as an improvement in the quality of care. Others state the dangers of depersonalization of medicine and the pathologization of daily life. This paper examines the ethical implications of telehealthcare, focusing on patient autonomy and quality of care by analyzing metareviews, randomized controlled trials and narrative ethical analyses on the topic. As a result, we conclude that the technically enhanced encounter between patients and health professionals may mean an empowerment of patient autonomy when it goes along with a personal relationship based on trust, assistance and support. When it comes to the quality of care, telehealthcare may lead to an improvement as long it is adopted to the patient's individual needs.",2017-01-01,Science And Engineering Ethics,"empowerment, patient autonomy, quality of care, telehealthcare, telemedicine","activities of daily living, depersonalization, ethical analysis, humans, medicalization, personal autonomy, power, psychological, professional-patient relations, quality of health care, self care, telemedicine, trust",10.1007/s11948-017-9885-3,"Institute of the History, Philosophy and Ethics of Medicine, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany. giovanni.rubeis@uni-ulm.de., Institute of the History, Philosophy and Ethics of Medicine, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany., Institute of the History, Philosophy and Ethics of Medicine, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany."

Detection and quantitation of synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists in infused papers from prisons in a constantly evolving illicit market.,"Caitlyn Norman, Gillian Walker, Brian Mckirdy, Ciara Mcdonald, Daniel Fletcher, Lysbeth H Antonides, Oliver B Sutcliffe, Niamh Nic Daéid, Craig Mckenzie","Drug misuse in prisons contributes to increased disruption and violence and negatively impacts prisoner safety, rehabilitation, and recovery. Synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists (SCRAs), colloquially known as ""spice"", are infused into papers and are of particular concern in a prison setting where they are commonly vaped. Methods for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of SCRA infused papers, including impurity profiling, were developed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) with qualitative confirmation by ultra high pressure liquid chromatography with photodiode array and quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry detection (UPLC-PDA-QToF-MS) and applied to 354 individual seized paper samples originating from 168 seizures from three Scottish prisons. Of these samples, 41% (146 samples from 101 seizures) contained at least one SCRA and multiple SCRAs were detected on 23% of these papers. Concentrations ranged from < 0.05-1.17 mg/cm<sup>2</sup> paper, representing the first reported quantitative data for SCRA infused papers. An evolution in the SCRAs detected was demonstrated; 5F-MDMB-PINACA (5F-ADB) predominated until late 2018, after which time 5F-MDMB-PICA and 4F-MDMB-BINACA became increasingly more prevalent, followed by the arrival of MDMB-4en-PINACA in June 2019. Concentration mapping data from two seized paper samples demonstrated that SCRA concentrations across larger papers were highly variable (0.47-2.38 mg/cm<sup>2</sup> paper) making consistent dosing by users, and representative sampling by laboratory analysts, difficult.

A concise review of applications of micellar liquid chromatography to study biologically active compounds.,Katarzyna E Stępnik,"The features of micellar systems are outstanding compared with conventional RP-LC ones. Therefore, the unique properties of micellar chromatography (MLC) are widely recognized. In this short review the applicability of MLC as an in vitro method for the determination of biological activity is discussed. For this purpose many specific examples of MLC applications supported by the theoretical backgrounds of the cited biological activity areas as well as the factors affecting them are presented. This study collects and organizes the most important references of bioactivity determination which were created both recently and in the past, using the MLC method. Although there are many papers on the MLC there is no literature review focused particularly on its applicability in the study of biological activity of various compounds. This work can be treated as a significant review of so far published papers which particularly emphasizes the importance of MLC as in vitro method for determination of bioactivity of different compounds.

Improving Medication Dosing in the Obese Patient.,Brian L Erstad,"The purpose of this paper is to provide clinicians with important considerations and caveats when evaluating published literature on medication dosing in obese subjects, since much of this literature involves short-term pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic studies that are not designed to look at clinically important outcomes. A secondary objective is to suggest improvements in the reporting of dosing information derived from clinical studies and incorporated into product information labeling that should help clinicians design medication-specific dosing regimens for patients with obesity. Data sources included published studies, review papers, and clinical practice guidelines concerning drug dosing of subjects with obesity. Medication dosing recommendations in product labeling typically are derived from studies of normal healthy volunteers and patients with single-system disease states or patients in a specialized setting (e.g. operating room, intensive care unit). Even in studies with relatively large sample sizes there are often relatively few subjects with extremes of body composition such as patients with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, so the appropriateness of labeled dosing information for these subjects is particularly ill-defined. Investigations of medication labeling information have demonstrated the inadequacy of this information for dosing patients of more extreme body size. Clinical investigations of drugs should be designed and the results reported in a manner that allows for meaningful recommendations for drug dosing in patients with varying degrees of obesity. Until and when such studies are routinely performed, there are steps that can be taken by the pharmaceutical industry, clinicians, and governmental agencies to help insure optimal drug dosing in obesity.",,Clinical Drug Investigation,no keywords,"body composition, body mass index, humans, obesity, pharmaceutical preparations, product labeling",10.1007/s40261-016-0461-4,"Department of Pharmacy Practice and Science, College of Pharmacy, University of Arizona, 1295 N.

Medicalising the menace? The symbiotic convergence of medicine and law enforcement in the medicalisation of marijuana in Minnesota.,Ryan T Steel,"The medicalisation of marijuana has occurred rapidly, albeit nonuniformly, across the US and around the world over the past 3 decades. This paper centres on the medicalisation of marijuana in Minnesota-which has one of the most restrictive programs in the country-as a case for evaluating the negotiation of institutional boundaries with the shift from criminalisation to medicalisation after nearly a century of criminal prohibition. Drawing upon Foucauldian discourse analyses of the medical and law enforcement associations' position statements and legislative hearings that shaped medical marijuana policy in Minnesota, this paper demonstrates a symbiotic convergence between medicine and law enforcement through the deployment of shared discursive strategies in their opposition to medical marijuana that reinforce marijuana's criminalised status by solidifying the boundaries between proper medicine and dangerous drugs. Criminal justice and medical institutions draw upon one another's definitions, logics, and practices in a mutually constitutive manner, while still maintaining distinct user subjects and institutional interventions for each based on the user's access to state-approved forms of marijuana. The consequences for the governing of marijuana in Minnesota are explored, as well as the broader implications for the sociological study of medicalisation and criminalisation with respect to the governance of drugs and health.",2022-01-01,Sociology Of Health & Illness,"criminalisation, discourse analysis, governance, institutional boundaries, medical marijuana","cannabis, humans, law enforcement, medical marijuana, medicalization, minnesota",10.1111/1467-9566.13513,"Department of Sociology and Anthropology, University of Richmond, Richmond, Virginia, USA."
Overview of Spanlastics: A Groundbreaking Elastic Medication Delivery Device with Versatile Prospects for Administration <i>via</i> Various Routes.,"Lalit Kumar, Ritesh Rana, Gauree Kukreti, Vikas Aggarwal, Himanshu Chaurasia, Puneet Sharma, Vuluchala Jyothiraditya","When compared to the challenges associated with traditional dosage forms, medication delivery systems based on nanotechnology have been a huge boon. One such candidate for medication delivery is spanlastics, an elastic nanovesicle that can transport a diverse array of medicinal compounds. The use of spanlastics has been associated with an increase in interest in alternative administration methods. The non-ionic surfactant or surfactant blend is the main component of spanlastics. The purpose of this review was primarily to examine the potential of spanlastics as a delivery system for a variety of medication classes administered via diverse routes. Science Direct, Google Scholar, and Pubmed were utilized to search the academic literature for this review. Several studies have demonstrated that spanlastics greatly improve therapeutic effectiveness, increase medication absorption, and decrease drug toxicity.

Is premenstrual dysphoric disorder really a disorder?,Tamara Kayali Browne,"Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) was recently moved to a full category in the DSM-5 (the latest edition of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders). It also appears set for inclusion as a separate disorder in the ICD-11 (the upcoming edition of the World Health Organization's International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems). This paper argues that PMDD should not be listed in the DSM or the ICD at all, adding to the call to recognise PMDD as a socially constructed disorder. I first present the argument that PMDD pathologises understandable anger/distress and that to do so is potentially dangerous. I then present evidence that PMDD is a culture-bound phenomenon, not a universal one. I also argue that even if (1) medication produces a desired effect, (2) there are biological correlates with premenstrual anger/distress, (3) such anger/distress seems to occur monthly, and (4) women are more likely than men to be diagnosed with affective disorders, none of these factors substantiates that premenstrual anger/distress is caused by a mental disorder. I argue that to assume they do is to ignore the now accepted role that one's environment and psychology play in illness development, as well as arguments concerning the social construction of mental illness. In doing so, I do not claim that there are no women who experience premenstrual distress or that their distress is not a lived experience. My point is that such distress can be recognised and considered significant without being pathologised and that it is unethical to describe premenstrual anger/distress as a mental disorder. Further, if the credibility of women's suffering is subject to doubt without a clinical diagnosis, then the way to address this problem is to change societal attitudes towards women's suffering, not to label women as mentally ill. The paper concludes with some broader implications for women and society of the change in status of PMDD in the DSM-5 as well as a sketch of critical policy suggestions to address these implications.",2014-01-01,Journal Of Bioethical Inquiry,no keywords,"diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, female, humans, medicalization, premenstrual dysphoric disorder",10.1007/s11673-014-9567-7,"Biology Teaching and Learning Centre, Research School of Biology, The Australian National University, R.N.

Prescriptions and proscriptions: moralising sleep medicines.,"Jonathan Gabe, Catherine M Coveney, Simon J Williams","The pharmaceuticalisation of sleep is a contentious issue. Sleep medicines get a 'bad press' due to their potential for dependence and other side effects, including studies reporting increased mortality risks for long-term users. Yet relatively little qualitative social science research has been conducted into how people understand and negotiate their use/non-use of sleep medicines in the context of their everyday lives. This paper draws on focus group data collected in the UK to elicit collective views on and experiences of prescription hypnotics across different social contexts. Respondents, we show, drew on a range of moral repertoires which allowed them to present themselves and their relationships with hypnotics in different ways. Six distinct repertoires about hypnotic use are identified in this regard: the 'deserving' patient, the 'responsible' user, the 'compliant' patient, the 'addict', the 'sinful' user and the 'noble' non user. These users and non-users are constructed drawing on cross-cutting themes of addiction and control, ambivalence and reflexivity.

Transgender medicalization and the attempt to evade psychological distress.,Robert Withers,"In this paper the author argues that trans-identification and its associated medical treatment can constitute an attempt to evade experiences of psychological distress. This occurs on three levels. Firstly, the trans person themselves may seek to evade dysregulated affects associated with such experiences as attachment trauma, childhood abuse, and ego-alien sexual feelings. Secondly, therapists may attempt to evade feelings, such as fear and hatred, evoked by engaging with these dysregulated affects. Thirdly, we, as a society, may wish to evade acknowledging the reality of such trauma, abuse and sexual distress by hypothesizing that trans-identification is a biological issue, best treated medically. The author argues that the quality of evidence supporting the biomedical approach is extremely poor.

Transforming Patient Compliance Research in an Era of Biomedicalization.,Karen Lutfey Spencer,"The term patient noncompliance emerged in the 1970s as a tool for analyzing why people do not follow medical directives. Despite its early popularity, the term has languished in sociology while flourishing in biomedical arenas. It seems flaccid in a contemporary healthcare context as it overestimates physician authority and is tone-deaf to biomedicalization. I draw from sociological and anthropological traditions, as well as qualitative interviews with terminally ill patients ( N = 26) and their caregivers ( N = 16), to consider facets of a biomedicalized health experience and implications for an updated vision of compliance. First, pathways to care have proliferated under biomedicalization. With increased pathways comes increased need for understanding how treatment plans are socially constituted and assessed. Finally, increased complexity demands a more diverse vocabulary for understanding health related decisions.

Ethical concerns with online direct-to-consumer pharmaceutical companies.,"Henry Curtis, Joseph Milner","In recent years, online direct-to-consumer pharmaceutical companies have been created as an alternative method for individuals to get prescription medications. While these companies have noble aims to provide easier, more cost-effective access to medication, the fact that these companies both issue prescriptions (via entirely online medical reviews that can have no direct contact between physician and patient) as well as distribute and ship medications creates multiple ethical concerns. This paper aims to explore two in particular. First, this model creates conflicts of interest for the physicians hired by these companies to write prescriptions. Second, the lack of direct contact from physicians may be harmful to prospective patients. After analysing these issues, this paper argues that there ought to be further consideration for regulation and oversight for these companies.",2019-01-01,Journal Of Medical Ethics,"health care economics, interests of health personnel/institutions, quality of health care","drug industry, humans, pharmaceutical preparations, physicians, prospective studies",10.1136/medethics-2019-105776,"Philosophy, SUNY Albany, Albany, New York, USA hcurtis@albany.edu., Family Medicine, Albany Medical Center, Albany, New York, USA."

Mindfulness meditation: do-it-yourself medicalization of every moment.,Kristin K Barker,"This paper examines mindfulness as a popular and paradigmatic alternative healing practice within the context of contemporary medicalization trends. In recognition of the increasingly influential role popular media play in shaping ideas about illness and healing, what follows is a discursive analysis of bestselling mindfulness meditation self-help books and audio recordings by Jon Kabat-Zinn. The central and contradictory elements of this do-it-yourself healing practice as presented in these materials are best understood as aligned with medicalization trends for three principal reasons. First, mindfulness represents a significant expansion in the definition of disease beyond that advanced by mainstream medicine. Second, its etiological model intensifies the need for therapeutic surveillance and intervention. Third, by defining healing as a never-ending process, it permanently locates individuals within a disease-therapy cycle. In sum, the definition, cause, and treatment of disease as articulated by popular mindfulness resources expands the terrain of experiences and problems that are mediated by medical concepts. The case of mindfulness is a potent illustration of the changing character of medicalization itself.",2014-01-01,Social Science & Medicine (1982),"alternative healing, complementary and alternative medicine (cam), discourse analysis, holistic care, medicalization, self-help","books, humans, medicalization, meditation, mindfulness, self care, tape recording",10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.01.024,"University of New Mexico, 1915 Roma, Bldg. 78, Albuquerque, NM 87131, United States.

Large-scale evaluation of ion mobility spectrometry for the rapid detection of synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists in infused papers in prisons.,"Caitlyn Norman, Brian Mckirdy, Gillian Walker, Pat Dugard, Niamh Nicdaéid, Craig Mckenzie","Synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists (SCRAs), colloquially known as ""spice,"" are commonly used in prisons and enter establishments via the mail in the form of infused papers. Many prisons use benchtop ion mobility spectroscopy (IMS) instruments to screen mail and seized materials for the presence of SCRAs and other controlled substances. The selectivity and sensitivity of Rapiscan Itemiser<sup>®</sup> 3E and Itemiser<sup>®</sup> 4DN Ion Trap Mobility Spectroscopy™ (ITMS™) systems were evaluated using 21 SCRA reference standards. Some differences in the SCRA reduced mobility (K<sub>0</sub> ) values were observed between this study and those reported previously using IMS detection systems, particularly for cumyl and quinolinyl SCRAs (e.g., 5F-PB-22, Cumyl-4CN-BINACA, and 5F-Cumyl-PEGACLONE), although this was found to have little effect at an operational level. Operational reliability of the systems was evaluated by analyzing 392 paper and card samples with known drug content. ITMS™ system results (e.g., detect or nondetect) were in agreement with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis in up to 95% of samples tested. Overall, this study found the ITMS™ systems tested to be effective instruments when deployed for the rapid detection of SCRA-infused papers. Used effectively and with up-to-date substance libraries, they will help reduce the supply of SCRAs into prisons and identify emerging threats as they arise. Several emerging SCRAs (5F-MPP-PICA, 5F-EMB-PICA, and 4F-MDMB-BICA) were detected for the first time in Scottish prisons between May and August 2020 as a result of routine monitoring, and all were detected using the ITMS™ systems tested.",2021-01-01,Drug Testing And Analysis,"forensic chemistry, ion mobility spectrometry, new psychoactive substances, prison, synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists","cannabinoid receptor agonists, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, humans, illicit drugs, ion mobility spectrometry, paper, prisons, reproducibility of results, scotland",10.1002/dta.2945,"Leverhulme Research Centre for Forensic Science, School of Science and Engineering, University of Dundee, Dundee, UK., HMP Inverness, Scottish Prison Service, Inverness, UK., Public Protection Unit, Scottish Prison Service, Edinburgh, UK., Leverhulme Research Centre for Forensic Science, School of Science and Engineering, University of Dundee, Dundee, UK., Leverhulme Research Centre for Forensic Science, School of Science and Engineering, University of Dundee, Dundee, UK., Leverhulme Research Centre for Forensic Science, School of Science and Engineering, University of Dundee, Dundee, UK."

[The psychiatrization and unpredictability of interpersonal violent behavior].,"Alessandra M A Nivoli, Paolo Milia, Cristiano Depalmas, Giancarlo Nivoli, Massimo Biondi, Giulia Taras, Liliana Lorettu","The relationship between mental illness and violent behavior is a complex phenomenon. Scientific literature indicates that the presence of a mental disorder, even severe, is not sufficient, alone, to predict or motivate violent behavior, which seems to be more associated with other intermediate variables. The phenomenon of psychiatrization of violent behavior can be defined, from a psychiatric-forensic point of view, as the prejudicial and erroneous attribution to mental illness as a causal factor in relation to violent behavior. This phenomenon has consequences in psychiatric clinical practice, but also at the level of social stigmatization, management of organizational and economic resources, and the judicial system. In this paper, clinical criticalities related to the psychiatrization of violent behavior will be analyzed, including the need to differentiate clinical etiology and legal causality, predictability and avoidability, protective clinical factors and clinical risk factors, the limits of categorical psychiatric diagnosis, the need for specific victimological information, the criticalities of pharmacotherapy. Some forensic criticalities will also be analyzed, including errors in clinical and forensic methodology (psychiatrization of the symptom, prejudicial contamination, diagnostic overshadowing, legal causalization of protective and risk factors, the use of categorical diagnosis in the forensic field, the psychiatrization of non-pathological human experiences, the criminalization of the subject with mental disorder). In conclusion, it is highlighted that an individual can have a psychic disorder, even severe, but this disorder is not necessarily in a causal relationship with violent behavior. The lack of a causal relationship makes predictability of violent behavior difficult, even impossible depending on the case, both in the general population and in individuals with psychiatric disorders.",,Rivista Di Psichiatria,no keywords,"dangerous behavior, forensic psychiatry, humans, interpersonal relations, medicalization, mental disorders, risk factors, substance-related disorders, violence",10.1708/3504.34905,"Clinica Psichiatrica, Dipartimento di Scienze Mediche, Chirurgiche e Sperimentali, Università degli studi di Sassari, AOU-Sassari., Clinica Psichiatrica, Dipartimento di Scienze Mediche, Chirurgiche e Sperimentali, Università degli studi di Sassari, AOU-Sassari., Clinica Psichiatrica, Dipartimento di Scienze Mediche, Chirurgiche e Sperimentali, Università degli studi di Sassari, AOU-Sassari., Dipartimento di Neuroscienze Umane, Sapienza Università di Roma., Clinica Psichiatrica, Dipartimento di Scienze Mediche, Chirurgiche e Sperimentali, Università degli studi di Sassari, AOU-Sassari., Clinica Psichiatrica, Dipartimento di Scienze Mediche, Chirurgiche e Sperimentali, Università degli studi di Sassari, AOU-Sassari."
Paper waste and carbon emissions from oral contraceptive leaflets.,"Myriam Safrai, Dana Elly, Noah Gruber, Benjamin Stern, Doron Kabiri, Moran Shapira","Oral contraceptives (OC) are the most used form of contraception among women in the U.S. and Europe.

On average, leaflets accounted for 55% of the package weight, while pills and blister dispensers represented only 32%. The mean weight of OC leaflets was 12.3 ± 5.5 grams (4.7-21.9 grams), leading to an estimated annual paper waste of 6,118.4 tons, 5,763.5 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions, and the use of approximately 146,841 trees for production. Standardizing leaflet weight to the lightest reported can reduce annual waste by 3780.5 tons of paper.

A scoping review of studies comparing the medication event monitoring system (MEMS) with alternative methods for measuring medication adherence.,"Mohamed El Alili, Bernard Vrijens, Jenny Demonceau, Silvia M Evers, Mickael Hiligsmann","Different methods are available for measuring medication adherence. In this paper, we conducted a scoping review to identify and summarize evidence of all studies comparing the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS) with alternative methods for measuring medication adherence. A literature search was performed using the open database www.iAdherence.org that includes all original studies reporting findings from the MEMS. Papers comparing methods for measuring adherence to solid oral formulations were included. Data was extracted using a standardized extraction table. A total of 117 articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria, including 251 comparisons. Most frequent comparisons were against self-report (n = 119) and pill count (n = 59). Similar outcome measures were used in 210 comparisons (84%), among which 78 used dichotomous variables (adherent or not) and 132 used continuous measures (adherence expressed as percentage). Furthermore, 32% of all comparisons did not estimate adherence over the same coverage period and 44% of all comparisons did not use a statistical method or used a suboptimal one. Only eighty-seven (35%) comparisons had similar coverage periods, similar outcome measures and optimal statistical methods. Compared to MEMS, median adherence was grossly overestimated by 17% using self-report, by 8% using pill count and by 6% using rating. In conclusion, among all comparisons of MEMS versus alternative methods for measuring adherence, only a few used adequate comparisons in terms of outcome measures, coverage periods and statistical method.

Enantiomer pairs of eight tert-leucinate or valinate indole- and indazole-3-carboxamide SCRAs were synthesized and their CB<sub>1</sub> potency and efficacy assessed using an in vitro β-arrestin recruitment assay in a HEK239T stable cell system. A chiral high-performance liquid chromatography method with photodiode array and/or quadrupole time-of-flight-mass spectrometry detection (HPLC-PDA and HPLC-PDA-QToF-MS) was applied to 177 SCRA-infused paper samples seized in Scottish prisons between 2018 and 2020. In most samples, SCRAs were almost enantiopure (S)-enantiomer (>98% of total chromatographic peak area), although in some (n = 18), 2% to 16% of the (R)-enantiomer was detected. (S)-enantiomers are consistently more potent than (R)-enantiomers and often more efficacious. The importance of SCRA-CB<sub>1</sub> receptor interactions in the ""head"" or ""linked group"" moiety is demonstrated, with the conformation of the ""bulky"" tert-leucinate group greatly affecting potency (by up to a factor of 374), significantly greater than the difference observed between valinate SCRA enantiomers. (S)-MDMB-4en-PINACA, (S)-4F-MDMB-BINACA, and (S)-5F-MDMB-PICA are currently the most prevalent SCRAs in Scottish prisons, and all have similar high potency (EC<sub>50</sub> , 1-5 nM) and efficacy. Infused paper samples were compared using estimated intrinsic efficacy at the CB<sub>1</sub> receptor (EIE<sub>CB1</sub> ) to evaluate samples with variable SCRA content. Given their similar potency and efficacy, any variation in CB<sub>1</sub> receptor-mediated psychoactive effects are likely to derive from variation in dose, mode of use, pharmacokinetic differences, and individual factors affecting the user, rather than differences in the specific SCRA present.",2020-01-01,Drug Testing And Analysis,"activity-based bioassay, chiral profiling, new psychoactive substances, prisons, synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists","biological assay, cannabinoid receptor agonists, chromatography, high pressure liquid, hek293 cells, humans, illicit drugs, mass spectrometry, paper, prisons, scotland, stereoisomerism, beta-arrestins",10.1002/dta.2965,"Leverhulme Research Centre for Forensic Science, School of Science and Engineering, University of Dundee, Dundee, UK., Laboratory of Toxicology, Department of Bioanalysis, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium., Leverhulme Research Centre for Forensic Science, School of Science and Engineering, University of Dundee, Dundee, UK., Leverhulme Research Centre for Forensic Science, School of Science and Engineering, University of Dundee, Dundee, UK., Department of Natural Sciences, Manchester Metropolitan University, Manchester, UK., Laboratory of Toxicology, Department of Bioanalysis, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium., Leverhulme Research Centre for Forensic Science, School of Science and Engineering, University of Dundee, Dundee, UK."

Impact of Porous Matrices and Concentration by Lyophilization on Cell-Free Expression.,"Steven M Blum, Marilyn S Lee, Glory E Mgboji, Vanessa L Funk, Kathryn Beabout, Svetlana V Harbaugh, Pierce A Roth, Alvin T Liem, Aleksandr E Miklos, Peter A Emanuel, Scott A Walper, Jorge Luis Chávez, Matthew W Lux","Cell-free expression systems have drawn increasing attention as a tool to achieve complex biological functions outside of the cell. Several applications of the technology involve the delivery of functionality to challenging environments, such as field-forward diagnostics or point-of-need manufacturing of pharmaceuticals. To achieve these goals, cell-free reaction components are preserved using encapsulation or lyophilization methods, both of which often involve an embedding of components in porous matrices like paper or hydrogels. Previous work has shown a range of impacts of porous materials on cell-free expression reactions. Here, we explored a panel of 32 paperlike materials and 5 hydrogel materials for the impact on reaction performance. The screen included a tolerance to lyophilization for reaction systems based on both cell lysates and purified expression components. For paperlike materials, we found that (1) materials based on synthetic polymers were mostly incompatible with cell-free expression, (2) lysate-based reactions were largely insensitive to the matrix for cellulosic and microfiber materials, and (3) purified systems had an improved performance when lyophilized in cellulosic but not microfiber matrices. The impact of hydrogel materials ranged from completely inhibitory to a slight enhancement. The exploration of modulating the rehydration volume of lyophilized reactions yielded reaction speed increases using an enzymatic colorimetric reporter of up to twofold with an optimal ratio of 2:1 lyophilized reaction to rehydration volume for the lysate system and 1.5:1 for the purified system. The effect was independent of the matrices assessed. Testing with a fluorescent nonenzymatic reporter and no matrix showed similar improvements in both yields and reaction speeds for the lysate system and yields but not reaction speeds for the purified system. We finally used these observations to show an improved performance of two sensors that span reaction types, matrix, and reporters. In total, these results should enhance efforts to develop field-forward applications of cell-free expression systems.",2021-01-01,Acs Synthetic Biology,"cell-free, cell-free expression, cell-free sensors","biosensing techniques, cell-free system, cellulose, cross-linking reagents, freeze drying, hydrogels, paper, porosity, quartz",10.1021/acssynbio.0c00634,"United States Army Combat Capabilities Development Command Chemical Biological Center. 8198 Blackhawk Road, APG, Aberdeen, Maryland 21010, United States., United States Army Combat Capabilities Development Command Chemical Biological Center. 8198 Blackhawk Road, APG, Aberdeen, Maryland 21010, United States., United States Army Combat Capabilities Development Command Chemical Biological Center. 8198 Blackhawk Road, APG, Aberdeen, Maryland 21010, United States., United States Army Combat Capabilities Development Command Chemical Biological Center. 8198 Blackhawk Road, APG, Aberdeen, Maryland 21010, United States., UES, Inc., Dayton, Ohio 45432, United States., 711th Human Performance Wing, Air Force Research Laboratory, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio 45433, United States., United States Army Combat Capabilities Development Command Chemical Biological Center. 8198 Blackhawk Road, APG, Aberdeen, Maryland 21010, United States., United States Army Combat Capabilities Development Command Chemical Biological Center. 8198 Blackhawk Road, APG, Aberdeen, Maryland 21010, United States., United States Army Combat Capabilities Development Command Chemical Biological Center. 8198 Blackhawk Road, APG, Aberdeen, Maryland 21010, United States., United States Army Combat Capabilities Development Command Chemical Biological Center. 8198 Blackhawk Road, APG, Aberdeen, Maryland 21010, United States., Naval Research Laboratory, 4555 Overlook Avenue SW, Washington, District of Columbia 20375, United States., 711th Human Performance Wing, Air Force Research Laboratory, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio 45433, United States., United States Army Combat Capabilities Development Command Chemical Biological Center. 8198 Blackhawk Road, APG, Aberdeen, Maryland 21010, United States."
Medicalizing to demedicalize: lactation consultants and the (de)medicalization of breastfeeding.,Jennifer M C Torres,"This paper uses the domain of breastfeeding in the U.S. and the work of International Board Certified Lactation Consultants to refine the concept of medicalization-demedicalization. Given lactation consultants' origins and current role in maternity care, they provide a unique lens on these processes because they are positioned at the crossroads of medicalization and demedicalization. Using 150 h of ethnographic observation and 39 interviews conducted between 2008 and 2012, I identify aspects of medicalization-demedicalization in the work of lactation consultants according to four dimensions: medical definition, medical control, pathology, and medical technology. Lactation consultants work to demedicalize breastfeeding by challenging the construction of breastfeeding pathology and limiting intervention. At the same time, they hold a position of medical control and medicalize breastfeeding by reinforcing a medical definition and using medical technology to treat breastfeeding problems. However, lactation consultants are not only working toward demedicalization and medicalization simultaneously, but are also medicalizing to demedicalize. Their position of medical control over breastfeeding provides them with a certain measure of authority that they can use in their efforts to depathologize breastfeeding and limit medical intervention. These findings build upon previous research that has identified cases of medicalization and demedicalization occurring simultaneously and draw attention to the need for an understanding of medicalization-demedicalization as a continuous process. Furthermore, the concept of ""medicalizing to demedicalize"" provides a novel contribution to the literature.",2013-01-01,Social Science & Medicine (1982),"breastfeeding, demedicalization, ethnography, medicalization, usa","anthropology, cultural, breast feeding, consultants, female, humans, infant, lactation, medicalization, qualitative research, united states",10.1016/j.socscimed.2013.11.013,"University of Michigan, 3001 LSA Building, 500 S.

Building on sociological literature related to medicalisation, this paper argues that the lived experience of medicalisation is a non-linear, complex process whereby individual engagement with medical authority is both empowering and constraining in the lives of trans people. Inductive qualitative analysis of 158 hours of participant observation and 33 in-depth interviews with members of a transgender community organisation revealed that transgender individuals (i) reject a medical frame for gender dysphoria, (ii) embrace and stress the importance of gender-affirming medical technologies for individual identity development and social interaction and (iii) strategically reintroduce medical logics and embrace medical authority in order to facilitate medical and social recognition, validation and acceptance.",2018-01-01,Sociology Of Health & Illness,"ethnography, gender, medicalisation","anthropology, cultural, diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, gender dysphoria, humans, interviews as topic, medicalization, qualitative research, sociology, medical, transgender persons",10.1111/1467-9566.12829,"Kenyon College, Gambier, Ohio, USA."
Rapid detection of NBOME's and other NPS on blotter papers by direct ATR-FTIR spectrometry.,José Coelho Neto,"Blotter paper is among the most common forms of consumption of new psychotropic substances (NPS), formerly referred as designer drugs. In many cases, users are misled to believe they are taking LSD when, in fact, they are taking newer and less known drugs like the NBOMEs or other substituted phenethylamines. We report our findings in quick testing of blotter papers for illicit substances like NBOMEs and other NPS by taking ATR-FTIR spectra directly from blotters seized on the streets, without any sample preparation. Both sides (front and back) of each blotter were tested. Collected data were analyzed by single- and multi-component spectral matching and submitted to chemometric discriminant analysis. Our results showed that, on 66.7% of the cases analyzed, seized blotters contained one or more types of NBOMEs, confirming the growing presence of this novel substances on the market. Matching IR signals were detected on both or just one side of the blotters and showed variable strength. Although no quantitative analysis was made, detection of these substances by the proposed approach serves as indication of variable and possibly higher dosages per blotter when compared to LSD, which showed to be below the detection limit of the applied method. Blotters containing a mescaline-like compound, later confirmed by GC-MS and LC-MS to be MAL (methallylescaline), a substance very similar to mescaline, were detected among the samples tested. Validity of direct ATR-FTIR testing was confirmed by checking the obtained results against independent GC-MS or LC-MS results for the same cases/samples.",2015-01-01,Forensic Science International,"atr-ftir, blotter papers, discriminant analysis, mal (methallylescaline), nbome, nps (new psychotropic substances)","discriminant analysis, humans, illicit drugs, paper, psychotropic drugs, spectroscopy, fourier transform infrared",10.1016/j.forsciint.2015.04.025,"Divisão de Laboratório, Instituto de Criminalística da Polícia Civil de Minas Gerais, Rua Juiz de Fora, 400, CEP 30180-060 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; Departamento de Física e Química, Pontifícia Universidade Católica de Minas Gerais, Avenida Dom José Gaspar, 500, CEP 30535-901 Belo Horizonte,MG, Brazil.

Paper-Based Enzyme Competition Assay for Detecting Falsified β-Lactam Antibiotics.,"Katherine E Boehle, Cody S Carrell, Joseph Caraway, Charles S Henry","Falsified and substandard antibiotics are a growing worldwide problem that leads to increased patient mortality and decreased trust in healthcare, and contributes to antimicrobial resistance. Monitoring falsified antibiotics is difficult because most falsified pharmaceuticals are most commonly found in developing countries, where detecting the active ingredient is difficult due to lack of access to complex instrumentation. Herein, we describe the development and optimization of a microfluidic paper-based analytical device (μPAD) to detect the active ingredient in the most falsified class of antibiotics, β-lactams. The assay is based on enzyme competition, making it the first demonstrated competitive enzyme assay reported in paper-based devices. The assay uses nitrocefin, a chromogenic substrate, to compete with β-lactam antibiotics in a reaction with β-lactamase. A yellow color indicates legitimate drugs, while a color change from yellow to red indicates falsified drugs. In addition to testing for the active ingredient, another section of the device was added to test the sample pH to further verify results and identify common falsified ingredients like aspirin or baking soda. Calibration curves for four different antibiotics, including cefazolin, have been generated making it the first paper-based device capable of detecting both cephalosporin and penicillin antibiotics. The μPAD has also been tested with common falsified ingredients and four antibiotics in tablet or injectable form, demonstrating its potential for in-field falsified antibiotic testing.",2018-01-01,Acs Sensors,"beta-lactam antibiotics, beta-lactamase, enzyme competition, falsified antibiotics, microfluidic paper-based analytical devices, nitrocefin, substandard antibiotics","anti-bacterial agents, cephalosporins, counterfeit drugs, enzyme assays, equipment design, microfluidic analytical techniques, paper, tablets, beta-lactamases, beta-lactams",10.1021/acssensors.8b00163,No affiliations available

"A Comprehensive Review on Niosomes as a Strategy in Targeted Drug Delivery: Pharmaceutical, and Herbal Cosmetic Applications.","Sakshi Saharawat, Sushma Verma","Niosomes are newly developed, self-assembling sac-like transporters that deliver medication at a specific site in a focused manner, increasing availability in the body and prolonging healing effects. Niosome discovery has increased drugs' therapeutic effectiveness while also reducing adverse effects. This article aims to concentrate on the increase in the worldwide utilization of niosomal formulation. This overview presents a thorough perspective of niosomal investigation up until now, encompassing categories and production techniques, their significance in pharmaceutical transportation, and cosmetic use. The thorough literature review revealed that extensive attention has been given to developing nanocarriers for drug delivery as they hold immense endeavor to attain targeted delivery to the affected area simultaneously shielding the adjacent healthy tissue. Many reviews and research papers have been published that demonstrate the interest of scientists in niosomes. Phytoconstituents, which possess antioxidant, antibiotic, anti-inflammatory, wound healing, anti-acne, and skin whitening properties, are also encapsulated into niosome. Their flexibility allows for the incorporation of various therapeutic agents, including small molecules, proteins, and peptides making them adaptable for different types of drugs.

Could Moral Enhancement Interventions be Medically Indicated?,Sarah Carter,"This paper explores the position that moral enhancement interventions could be medically indicated (and so considered therapeutic) in cases where they provide a remedy for a lack of empathy, when such a deficit is considered pathological. In order to argue this claim, the question as to whether a deficit of empathy could be considered to be pathological is examined, taking into account the difficulty of defining illness and disorder generally, and especially in the case of mental health. Following this, Psychopathy and a fictionalised mental disorder (Moral Deficiency Disorder) are explored with a view to consider moral enhancement techniques as possible treatments for both conditions. At this juncture, having asserted and defended the position that moral enhancement interventions could, under certain circumstances, be considered medically indicated, this paper then goes on to briefly explore some of the consequences of this assertion. First, it is acknowledged that this broadening of diagnostic criteria in light of new interventions could fall foul of claims of medicalisation. It is then briefly noted that considering moral enhancement technologies to be akin to therapies in certain circumstances could lead to ethical and legal consequences and questions, such as those regarding regulation, access, and even consent.",,Health Care Analysis : Hca : Journal Of Health Philosophy And Policy,"bioethics, empathy, enhancement, moral enhancement, moral therapy, neuroethics","biomedical enhancement, empathy, humans, medicalization, mental disorders, morals, philosophy, medical",10.1007/s10728-016-0320-8,"The Centre for Social Ethics and Policy, School of Law, University of Manchester, Williamson Building, Oxford Road, Manchester, M13 9PL, UK. sarah.carter-4@postgrad.manchester.ac.uk."

Nano drug depots, characterized by core-shell structures with core drug reservoirs, are drawing increasing attention because of its potential applications in furnishing drug-sustained release profiles. In the present study, two kinds of nano drug depots, one containing a crystal drug reservoir and the other having a medicated composite drug reservoir, were prepared through modified triaxial electrospinning. Their drug-sustained release performances were compared in terms of initial burst release, middle linear release, and the late tailing off release. Although both depots had a linear morphology, clear core-shell nanostructures and the same cellulose acetate shell layer, they provided considerably different tailing off release performances, and thus different sustained release profiles. The composite-based drug depots showed a smaller tailing off drug amount of 2.2%, a shorter time period of 12 h, and a better zero-order controlled release kinetics in general than the crystal-based drug depots, whose tailing off amount was 9.3% over a time period of 36 h.

Choir Boy: Trans Vocal Performance and the De-Pathologization of Transition.,Marty Fink,"This paper will examine Choir Boy (2005), a trans coming-of-age novel by Charlie Anders, to disrupt historically rooted medical narratives of gender transition. Through a disability studies lens, this paper locates vocal performance as a means of speaking back to gatekeeping practices held in place by medical authorities since the inception of transsexuality as a classificatory category. Offering imaginative alternatives to ""wrong body"" diagnostics, this analysis places cultural texts in conversation with disability theory to reframe the trans self as a singing body that cannot be reduced to normalizing biomedical practices. Choir Boy frames vocal performance as a mode of gender expression and as a survival strategy against violence. The trans counter-narratives offered by Anders resist the medicalization of trans bodies and the classification of some bodies as not ""trans enough"" to qualify for transition. Choir Boy locates vocal performance and not binary gender identification as impetus for transition, thereby advocating for trans self-determination over medical access.",,The Journal Of Medical Humanities,"gatekeeping, gender, queer, trans, transition","gatekeeping, humans, male, medicalization, singing, transsexualism, violence, voice",10.1007/s10912-018-9524-2,"Ryerson University, 350 Victoria Street, Toronto, ON, M5B 2K3, Canada. marty.fink@ryerson.ca."
"Not Sick: Liberal, Trans, and Crip Feminist Critiques of Medicalization.",Cristina S Richie,"Medicalization occurs when an aspect of embodied humanity is scrutinized by the medical industry, claimed as pathological, and subsumed under medical intervention. Numerous critiques of medicalization appear in academic literature, often put forth by bioethicists who use a variety of ""lenses"" to make their case. Feminist critiques of medicalization raise the concerns of the politically disenfranchised, thus seeking to protect women-particularly natal sex women-from medical exploitation. This article will focus on three feminist critiques of medicalization, which offer an alternative narrative of sickness and health. I will first briefly describe the philosophical origins of medicalization. Then, I will present three feminist critiques of medicalization. Liberal feminism, trans feminism, and crip feminism tend to regard Western medicine with a hermeneutics of suspicion and draw out potential harms of medicalization of reproductive sexuality, gender, and disability, respectively. While neither these branches of feminism-nor their critiques-are homogenous, they provide much-needed commentaries on phallocentric medicine.

Interaction order and the labeling of disorder: How parents mobilize personal knowledge in the clinic to resist medicalization of their children's behavior.,Jason Turowetz,"This paper examines how parents of children diagnosed with autism resist the medicalization of their children's behavior. Drawing on video and ethnographic data collected over four years of fieldwork at a clinic for developmental disorders, the paper distinguishes two orders of practice - that of the clinic and that of the family - and argues that behavior which is interpreted as disordered in the clinic may be seen as ordinary in the home. These different interpretations reflect and renew distinct orders of sensemaking in the clinic and home, and parents may mobilize familial knowledge of the child to counter the medicalization of specific behavior patterns, even where they otherwise accept an autism diagnosis. In showing how medicalization and labelling are achieved and resisted in the mundane details of social interaction, the paper contributes to studies of diagnosis, disability, and deviance. Further, the myriad ways parents and clinicians contest which regions of a child's behavior get medicalized - i.e. which behavioral patterns are labeled disordered - present a challenge to binary conceptions of medicalization, recommending instead a more nuanced model of medicalization as a multi-dimensional continuum: more or less, rather than either-or.",2022-01-01,Social Science & Medicine (1982),"autism, conversation analysis, ethnomethodology, interaction, medicalization, resistance","autistic disorder, child, family, humans, knowledge, medicalization, parents",10.1016/j.socscimed.2022.114719,"University of Siegen, Nordrhein-Westfalen, Germany; Garfinkel Archive, Newburyport, MA 01950, USA.

What is wrong with 'being a pill-taker'? The special case of statins.,Louisa Polak,"In an interview study of decision-making about statins, many participants said they took pills regularly, yet described themselves as 'not really pill-takers'. This paper explores this paradox and its implications. The practice of pill-taking itself can constitute a challenge to the presentation of moral adequacy, beyond the potential for rendering stigmatised illnesses visible. Meeting this challenge involves a complex process of calibrating often-conflicting moral imperatives: to be concerned, but not too concerned, over one's health; to be informed, but not over-informed; and deferential but not over-deferential to medical expertise. This calibration reflects a broader tension between rival tropes: embracing medical progress and resisting medicalisation. Participants who take statins present them as unquestionably necessary; 'needing' pills, as opposed to choosing to take them, serves as a defence against the devalued identity of being a pill-taker. However, needing to take statins offers an additional threat to identity, because taking statins is widely perceived to be an alternative strategy to 'choosing a healthy lifestyle'. This perception underpins a responsibilising health promotion discourse that shapes and complicates the work participants do to avoid presenting themselves as 'pill-takers'. The salience of this discourse should be acknowledged where discussions of medicalisation use statins as an example.",2016-01-01,Sociology Of Health & Illness,"adherence, cardiovascular disease, healthism, identity, medicalisation, surveillance medicine","aged, aged, 80 and over, decision making, dyslipidemias, female, humans, hydroxymethylglutaryl-coa reductase inhibitors, interviews as topic, male, medicalization, medication adherence, middle aged, perception",10.1111/1467-9566.12509,"Health Services Research and Policy, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK."

Molecular imprinting within hydrogels II: progress and analysis of the field.,"Mark E Byrne, Vishal Salian","In the past decade, there has been an exponential increase in the number of papers describing molecular imprinting in hydrogels, a technique which creates memory for template molecules within a flexible macromolecular structure. Macromolecular memory or structural plasticity of polymer chains is a superior description of weakly crosslinked imprinted networks since significant flexibility can occur within the polymer chains. The focus of this article is to review and highlight work in the field describing the imprinting strategy within hydrogels and associated challenges, characterization methods of imprinted gels, current and potential translational applications, and future strategies and directions. This paper also describes ways to improve binding parameter efficacy and presents significant areas of opportunity to further describe, characterize, and understand imprinted gels. An analysis of the literature indicates that imprinting in hydrogels leads to significant improvements in template affinity, capacity, and selectivity over non-templated hydrogels for a number of templates such as ions, small and moderate molecular weight molecules, proteins, viruses, DNA, and cells. However, the influence of imprinting on the transport of template is much more complex, with little attention of most studies to structural analysis or discussion of the gel porosity/tortuosity in the control of template transport. Responsive, intelligent imprinted hydrogels are also highlighted that exhibit reversibly modulated template binding and transport. It is clear that this field has transitioned from infancy and is leading to breakthroughs in a number of areas such as controlled and modulated drug delivery, diagnostic sensors, and separation. For example in drug delivery, imprinting can lead to delayed transport and provides further control of therapeutic transport through the macromolecular structure as well as optimizes the number of therapeutic molecules to polymer chains.",2008-01-01,International Journal Of Pharmaceutics,no keywords,"biological transport, chemistry, pharmaceutical, delayed-action preparations, drug carriers, drug delivery systems, hydrogels, molecular imprinting, pharmaceutical preparations, polymers, technology, pharmaceutical",10.1016/j.ijpharm.2008.09.002,"Biomimetic & Biohybrid Materials, Biomedical Devices, Department of Chemical Engineering, Auburn University, Auburn, AL 36849, USA. byrneme@eng.auburn.edu"
Pressure-Sensitive Adhesive Combined with Paper Spray Mass Spectrometry for Low-Cost Collection and Analysis of Drug Residues.,"Chau Bao Nguyen, William R A Wichert, Daniel O Carmany, Ethan M Mcbride, Phillip M Mach, Elizabeth S Dhummakupt, Trevor Glaros, Nicholas E Manicke","Illicit drug use causes over half a million deaths worldwide every year. Drugs of abuse are commonly smuggled through customs and border checkpoints and, increasingly, through parcel delivery services. Improved methods for detection of trace drug residues from surfaces are needed. Such methods should be robust, fieldable, sensitive, and capable of detecting a wide range of drugs. In this work, commercially produced paper with a pressure-sensitive adhesive coating was utilized for the collection and analysis of trace drug residues by paper spray mass spectrometry (MS). This modified substrate was used to combine sample collection of drug residues from surfaces with rapid detection using a single paper spray ticket. The all-in-one ticket was used to probe different surfaces commonly encountered in forensic work including clothing, cardboard, glass, concrete, asphalt, and aluminum.

Medicalising short children with growth hormone? Ethical considerations of the underlying sociocultural aspects.,Maria Cristina Murano,"In 2003, the Food and Drug Administration approved the use of growth hormone treatment for idiopathic short stature children, i.e. children shorter than average due to an unknown medical cause. Given the absence of any pathological conditions, this decision has been contested as a case of medicalisation. The aim of this paper is to broaden the debate over the reasons for and against the treatment, to include considerations of the sociocultural phenomenon of the medicalisation of short stature, by means of a critical understanding of the concept of medicalisation. After defining my understanding of medicalisation and describing both the treatment and the condition of idiopathic short stature, I will problematise two fundamental issues: the medical/non-medical distinction and the debate about the goals of medicine. I will analyse them, combining perspectives of bioethics, medical sociology, philosophy of medicine and medical literature, and I will suggest that there are different levels of normativity of medicalisation. Ultimately, this study shows that: (1) the definition of idiopathic short stature, focusing only on actual height measurement, does not provide enough information to assess the need for treatment or not; (2) the analysis of the goals of medicine should be broadened to include justifications for the treatment; (3) the use of growth hormone for idiopathic short stature involves strong interests from different stakeholders.

Fabrication of water/oil-resistant paper by nanocellulose stabilized Pickering emulsion and chitosan.,"Jinfeng Liu, Xi Chen, Hongkun Wang","Developing plastic/fluorine/silicon-free and degradable water/oil-resistant coatings for paper-based packaging materials to replace disposable plastic products is a very effective way to solve the problem of 'white pollution' or microplastics pollution. A novel water/oil-resistant coating was developed by alkyl ketene dimer (AKD)-based Pickering emulsion and chitosan in this work. Cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) were used as a stabilizing solid for AKD emulsion, with the addition of chitosan as an oil-resistance agent. The coating provides excellent hydrophobicity, water/oil resistance as well as good barrier properties. The water contact angle was as high as 130° and the minimum Cobb60 value was 5.7 g/m<sup>2</sup>, which was attributed to the hydrophobicity of AKD. In addition, the kit rating reached maximum 12/12 at coating weight of 8.26 g/m<sup>2</sup> and the water vapor transmittance rate (WVTR) was reduced to 153.4 g/(m<sup>2</sup>⋅day) at the coating weight of 10.50 g/m<sup>2</sup>.

Rationalizing the selection of oral lipid based drug delivery systems by an in vitro dynamic lipolysis model for improved oral bioavailability of poorly water soluble drugs.,"Arik Dahan, Amnon Hoffman","As a consequence of modern drug discovery techniques, there has been a consistent increase in the number of new pharmacologically active lipophilic compounds that are poorly water soluble. A great challenge facing the pharmaceutical scientist is making these molecules into orally administered medications with sufficient bioavailability. One of the most popular approaches to improve the oral bioavailability of these molecules is the utilization of a lipid based drug delivery system. Unfortunately, current development strategies in the area of lipid based delivery systems are mostly empirical. Hence, there is a need for a simplified in vitro method to guide the selection of a suitable lipidic vehicle composition and to rationalize the delivery system design. To address this need, a dynamic in vitro lipolysis model, which provides a very good simulation of the in vivo lipid digestion process, has been developed over the past few years. This model has been extensively used for in vitro assessment of different lipid based delivery systems, leading to enhanced understanding of the suitability of different lipids and surfactants as a delivery system for a given poorly water soluble drug candidate. A key goal in the development of the dynamic in vitro lipolysis model has been correlating the in vitro data of various drug-lipidic delivery system combinations to the resultant in vivo drug profile. In this paper, we discuss and review the need for this model, its underlying theory, practice and limitations, and the available data accumulated in the literature. Overall, the dynamic in vitro lipolysis model seems to provide highly useful initial guidelines in the development process of oral lipid based drug delivery systems for poorly water soluble drugs, and it predicts phenomena that occur in the pre-enterocyte stages of the intestinal absorption cascade.",2008-01-01,Journal Of Controlled Release : Official Journal Of The Controlled Release Society,no keywords,"administration, oral, animals, biological availability, chemistry, pharmaceutical, drug carriers, drug compounding, humans, intestinal absorption, lipids, lipolysis, lymphatic system, models, biological, pharmaceutical preparations, pharmacokinetics, solubility, technology, pharmaceutical",10.1016/j.jconrel.2008.03.021,"Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA."

"Equipment and analytical companies meeting continuous challenges.

In addition to valued input from several vendors, commentary was provided from experienced pharmaceutical representatives, who have installed various continuous platforms. Additionally, a small medium enterprise (SME) perspective was obtained through interviews. A range of technical challenges is outlined, including: the presence of particles, equipment scalability, fouling (and cleaning), technology derisking, specific analytical challenges, and the general requirement of improved technical training. Equipment and analytical companies can make a significant contribution to help the introduction of continuous technology. A key point is that many of these challenges exist in batch processing and are not specific to continuous processing. Backward compatibility of software is not a continuous issue per se. In many cases, there is available learning from other industries. Business models and opportunities through outsourced development partners are also highlighted. Agile smaller companies and academic groups have a key role to play in developing skills, working collaboratively in partnerships, and focusing on solving relevant industry challenges. The precompetitive space differs for vendor companies compared with large pharmaceuticals. Currently, there is no strong consensus around a dominant continuous design, partly because of business dynamics and commercial interests. A more structured common approach to process design and hardware and software standardization would be beneficial, with initial practical steps in modeling. Conclusions include a digestible systems approach, accessible and published business cases, and increased user, academic, and supplier collaboration. This mirrors US FDA direction. The concept of silos in pharmaceutical companies is a common theme throughout the white papers. In the equipment domain, this is equally prevalent among a broad range of companies, mainly focusing on discrete areas. As an example, the flow chemistry and secondary drug product communities are almost entirely disconnected. Control and Process Analytical Technologies (PAT) companies are active in both domains. The equipment actors are a very diverse group with a few major Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) players and a variety of SME, project providers, integrators, upstream downstream providers, and specialist PAT. In some cases, partnerships or alliances are formed to increase critical mass. This white paper has focused on small molecules; equipment associated with biopharmaceuticals is covered in a separate white paper. More specifics on equipment detail are provided in final dosage form and drug substance white papers. The equipment and analytical development from laboratory to pilot to production is important, with a variety of sensors and complexity reducing with scale. The importance of robust processing rather than overcomplex control strategy mitigation is important. A search of nonacademic literature highlights, with a few notable exceptions, a relative paucity of material. Much focuses on the economics and benefits of continuous, rather than specifics of equipment issues. The disruptive nature of continuous manufacturing represents either an opportunity or a threat for many companies, so the incentive to change equipment varies.

The top 20 active pharmaceutical ingredients compounded for children, globally, were: omeprazole, captopril, spironolactone, propranolol, furosemide, phenobarbital, hydrochlorothiazide, ursodeoxycholic acid, sildenafil, melatonin, clonidine, enalapril, dexamethasone, baclofen, caffeine, chloral hydrate, trimethoprim, atenolol, hydrocortisone, carvedilol and prednisolone. Diuretics, drugs for acid-related disorders, and beta-blockers were the top three most frequently compounded classes per the WHO Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system. The principal need identified for the practice of extemporaneous compounding for children was the development of an international, open-access formulary that includes validated formulations, as well as updated compounding literature and guidelines.

From distress to disease: a critique of the medicalisation of possession in DSM-5.,Divya Padmanabhan,"This paper critiques the category of possession-form dissociative identity disorder as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 (DSM-5) published in 2013 by the American Psychiatric Association (APA). The DSM as an index of psychiatry pathologises possession by categorising it as a form of dissociative identity disorder. Drawing upon ethnographic fieldwork, this paper argues that such a pathologisation medicalises possession, which is understood as a non-pathological condition in other contexts such as by those individuals who manifest possession at a temple in Kerala, South India. Through medicalising and further by creating distinctions between acceptable and pathological possession, the DSM converts a form of distress into a disease. This has both conceptual and pragmatic implications. The temple therefore becomes reduced to a culturally acceptable site for the manifestation of a mental illness in a form that is culturally available and possession is explained solely through a biomedical framework, denying alternative conceptualisations and theories which inform possession. By focussing on the DSM-5 classification of possession and the limitations of such a classification, this paper seeks to posit an alternative conceptualisation of possession by engaging with three primary areas which are significant in the DSM categorisation of possession: the DSM's conceptualisation of self in the singular, the distinction between pathological and non-pathological forms of possession, and the limitations of the DSM's equation of the condition of possession with the manifestation of possession. Finally, the paper briefly highlights alternative conceptualisations of possession, which emerged from the perspective of those seeking to heal possession at the Chottanikkara temple.",,Anthropology & Medicine,"kerala, spirit possession, disease, distress, healing, treatment","anthropology, medical, diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, humans, india, medicalization, mental disorders, religion, spirit possession",10.1080/13648470.2017.1389168,"a School of Social Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University , New Delhi , India."
"Fingermarks development on gloves: Relative efficiency of 1,2 Indanedione/ZnCl<sub>2</sub>, ninhydrin and wet powder.","Mélina Rousseau, Pierre Ledroit, Marianne Malo, Damien Henrot, Hélène Guille","Powder suspensions such as wet powder are used to develop fingermarks on adhesive surfaces. They can also be used on gloves but these ready-to-use commercial pre-mixed solutions are not entirely satisfactory. Among other things, they generate some background noise that can sometimes be substantial and make the exploitation of the fingermarks difficult. Recent studies have proven the effectiveness of a HFE ninhydrin solution on some types of gloves. Ninhydrin and 1,2-indanedione are reagents that are commonly used for the visualisation of fingermarks on porous and semi-porous substrates. Applying them on gloves might help to overcome the issue of background noise being produced by powder suspensions. In this study, several formulations of ninhydrin and 1,2-indanedione are compared to wet powder on a sample of nitrile, latex and vinyl gloves.

Bacteria survival probability in bactericidal filter paper.,"Nura Mansur-Azzam, Zeinab Hosseinidoust, Su Gyeong Woo, Renata Vyhnalkova, Adi Eisenberg, Theo G M Van De Ven","Bactericidal filter papers offer the simplicity of gravity filtration to simultaneously eradicate microbial contaminants and particulates. We previously detailed the development of biocidal block copolymer micelles that could be immobilized on a filter paper to actively eradicate bacteria. Despite the many advantages offered by this system, its widespread use is hindered by its unknown mechanism of action which can result in non-reproducible outcomes. In this work, we sought to investigate the mechanism by which a certain percentage of Escherichia coli cells survived when passing through the bactericidal filter paper. Through the process of elimination, the possibility that the bacterial survival probability was controlled by the initial bacterial load or the existence of resistant sub-populations of E. coli was dismissed. It was observed that increasing the thickness or the number of layers of the filter significantly decreased bacterial survival probability for the biocidal filter paper but did not affect the efficiency of the blank filter paper (no biocide). The survival probability of bacteria passing through the antibacterial filter paper appeared to depend strongly on the number of collision between each bacterium and the biocide-loaded micelles. It was thus hypothesized that during each collision a certain number of biocide molecules were directly transferred from the hydrophobic core of the micelle to the bacterial lipid bilayer membrane. Therefore, each bacterium must encounter a certain number of collisions to take up enough biocide to kill the cell and cells that do not undergo the threshold number of collisions are expected to survive.",2014-01-01,"Colloids And Surfaces.

On good and bad forms of medicalization.,Erik Parens,"The ongoing 'enhancement' debate pits critics of new self-shaping technologies against enthusiasts. One important thread of that debate concerns medicalization, the process whereby 'non-medical' problems become framed as 'medical' problems. In this paper I consider the charge of medicalization, which critics often level at new forms of technological self-shaping, and explain how that charge can illuminate--and obfuscate. Then, more briefly, I examine the charge of pharmacological Calvinism, which enthusiasts, in their support of technological self-shaping, often level at critics. And I suggest how that charge, too, can illuminate and obfuscate. Exploring the broad charge of medicalization and the narrower counter charge of pharmacological Calvinism leads me to conclude that, as satisfying as it can be to level one of those charges at our intellectual opponents, and as tempting as it is to lie down and rest with our favorite insight, we need to gather the energy to have a conversation about the difference between good and bad forms of medicalization. Specifically, I suggest that if we consider the 'medicalization of love,' we can see why critics of and enthusiasts about technological self-shaping should want (and in some cases have already begun) to distinguish between good and bad forms of such medicalization.",2011-01-01,Bioethics,no keywords,"drug therapy, ethical analysis, humans, medicalization, morals, social values",10.1111/j.1467-8519.2011.01885.x,"The Hastings Center, Garrison, New York 10524 USA. parense@thehastingscenter.org"

Controlling Macroscopic Phase Separation of Aqueous Two-Phase Polymer Systems in Porous Media.,"David Y Pereira, Chloe M Wu, So Youn Lee, Eumene Lee, Benjamin M Wu, Daniel T Kamei","In previous work, our group discovered a phenomenon in which a mixed polymer-salt or mixed micellar aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) separates into its two constituent phases as it flows within paper. While these ATPSs worked well in their respective studies to concentrate the target biomarker and improve the sensitivity of the lateral-flow immunoassay, different ATPSs can be advantageous for new applications based on factors such as biomarker partitioning or biochemical compatibility between ATPS and sample components. However, since the mechanism of phase separation in porous media is not completely understood, introducing other ATPSs to paper is an unpredictable process that relies on trial and error experiments. This is especially true for polymer-polymer ATPSs in which the characteristics of the two phases appear quite similar. Therefore, our group aimed to develop semiquantitative guidelines for choosing ATPSs that can phase separate in paper. In this work, we evaluated the Washburn equation and its parameters as a potential mathematical framework to describe the flow behavior of polymer-salt and micellar ATPSs in fiberglass paper. We compared bulk phase fluid characteristics and identified the viscosity difference between the phases as a key determinant of the potential for phase separation in paper. We then used this parameter to predict the phase separation capabilities of polyethylene glycol (PEG)-dextran ATPSs in paper and control the composition of the leading and lagging phases.

Transformation of FGM/C include medicalization although poorly understood has increased undermining abandonment efforts for the practice. We sought to understand drivers of medicalization in FGM/C among selected Kenyan communities. A qualitative study involving participants from Abagusii, Somali and Kuria communities and key informants with health care providers from four Kenyan counties was conducted. Data were collected using in-depth interviews (n = 54), key informant interviews (n = 56) and 45 focus group discussions. Data were transcribed and analyzed thematically using NVivo version 12. We found families practiced FGM/C for reasons including conformity to culture/tradition, religion, marriageability, fear of negative sanctions, and rite of passage. Medicalized FGM/C was only reported by participants from the Abagusii and Somali communities. Few Kuria participants shared that medicalized FGM/C was against their culture and would attract sanctions. Medicalized FGM/C was perceived to have few health complications, shorter healing, and enables families to hide from law. To avoid arrest or sanctions, medicalized FGM/C was performed at home/private clinics. Desire to mitigate health complications and income were cited as reasons for health providers performing of FGM/C. Medicalization was believed to perpetuate the practice as it was perceived as modernized FGM/C. FGM/C remains pervasive in the studied Kenyan communities albeit changed form and context. Findings suggest medicalization sustain FGM/C by allowing families and health providers to conform to social norms underpinning FGM/C while addressing risks of FGM/C complications and legal prohibitions.

Is the full potential of the biopharmaceutics classification system reached?,"Christel A S Bergström, Sara B E Andersson, Jonas H Fagerberg, Gert Ragnarsson, Anders Lindahl","In this paper we analyse how the biopharmaceutics classification system (BCS) has been used to date. A survey of the literature resulted in a compilation of 242 compounds for which BCS classes were reported. Of these, 183 compounds had been reported to belong to one specific BCS class whereas 59 compounds had been assigned to multiple BCS classes in different papers. Interestingly, a majority of the BCS class 2 compounds had fraction absorbed (FA) values >85%, indicating that they were completely absorbed after oral administration. Solubility was computationally predicted at pH 6.8 for BCS class 2 compounds to explore the impact of the pH of the small intestine, where most of the absorption occurs, on the solubility. In addition, the solubilization capacity of lipid aggregates naturally present in the intestine was studied computationally and experimentally for a subset of 12 compounds. It was found that all acidic compounds with FA>85% were completely dissolved in the pH of the small intestine. Further, lipids at the concentration used in fasted state simulated intestinal fluid (FaSSIF) dissolved the complete dose given of the most lipophilic (logD6.5>3) compounds studied. Overall, biorelevant dissolution media (pure buffer of intestinal pH or FaSSIF) identified that for 20 of the 29 BCS class 2 compounds with FA>85% the complete dose given orally would be dissolved. These results indicate that a more relevant pH restriction for acids and/or dissolution medium with lipids present better forecast solubility-limited absorption in vivo than the presently used BCS solubility criterion.

Disordered eating and the contradictions of neoliberal governance.,Iain Pirie,"The last decade has seen the development of an important literature on the contradictions between neoliberal norms of corporal citizenship and the forms of consumption that market-based food systems promote. This paper seeks to contribute to the literature by exploring the relationship between these contradictions and the increased prevalence of particular eating disorders (binge eating disorder (BED) and bulimia nervosa). Within contemporary neoliberal food systems bingeing is increasingly normalised and consumption temporally disorganised. At the same time, neoliberal public health policy, and the wider 'health' entertainment media it legitimates, focuses on the promotion of 'correct' forms of consumer agency. Individuals who fail to manage consumption 'appropriately' are stigmatised. The growth of bulimia and BED can be related to the contradictory pressures that the food system and regime of corporal governance place on individuals. The paper also seeks to explore how the increased medicalisation and biomedicalisation of eating since the 1980s fits within a broader neoliberal governance strategy. By medicalising key social problems the neoliberal state depoliticises these issues. Medicalisation and biomedicalisation obscure the role of capitalism in generating these problems and encourage a focus on individual dysfunction.",2016-01-01,Sociology Of Health & Illness,"capitalism, consumption, diet, eating disorders, government/state, political economy","binge-eating disorder, bulimia nervosa, capitalism, diet, feeding behavior, health policy, humans, medicalization, public policy",10.1111/1467-9566.12408,"Department of Politics, University of Warwick, UK."

The modification with mercury films led to the most sensitive method, with linear ranges between 0.1 and 10 µg/mL and limits of detection of 0.4, 0.1, 0.04 and 0.2 µg/mL for Cd (II), Pb (II), In (III) and Cu (II), respectively.

Taking pills for developmental ails in Southern Brazil: The biologization of adolescence?,Dominique P Béhague,"In the late 1990s researchers in Pelotas Southern Brazil began documenting what they considered to be unacceptably high rates of licensed psychotropic use among individuals of all ages, including youth. This came as a surprise, since the vast majority of psychiatrists in Pelotas draw on psychoanalytic theory and approach pharmaceutical use, especially for children and adolescents, in a consciously tempered way. Drawing from a longitudinal ethnographic sub-study, part of a larger 1982 birth cohort study, this paper follows the circuitous trajectories of emergent pharma-patterns among ""shantytown"" youth over a ten-year period, exploring the thickly layered and often moralized contingencies in which psychodynamic psychiatrists' intention to resist excessive pharmaceuticalization both succeed and crumble. I juxtapose these trajectories with the growing salience of an ""anti-biologizing"" explanatory framework that psychiatrists and researchers are using to pre-empt the kind of diagnostics-driven ""biopsychiatrization"" so prevalent in North America. My analysis suggests that psychiatrists' use of this framework ironically contributes to their failed attempts to ""resist"" pharmaceuticalization.",2014-01-01,Social Science & Medicine (1982),"brazil, child psychiatry, epistemology, medicalization, pharmaceuticals, prototype, psychoanalysis","adolescent, anthropology, cultural, biology, brazil, humans, inappropriate prescribing, longitudinal studies, medicalization, poverty, practice patterns, physicians', prospective studies, psychiatry, psychology, adolescent, psychotropic drugs, young adult",10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.11.028,"Vanderbilt University, USA; King's College London, UK; London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, UK.

Analysing the skin barrier from down under.,"J Grice, H A E Benson","Over the past 40 years the Australian contribution to the field of skin science has been led by Michael Roberts. One of his earliest papers on membrane permeation was published in Nature, setting the scene for his huge contribution to both the fundamental understanding of skin permeability and the application of that knowledge to improved clinical outcomes, new delivery technologies and minimizing toxicological risk. His work has been characterized by a mechanistic, mathematical approach to defining skin permeation. He defined the parameters important to skin permeation, established structure-penetration relationships and demonstrated the importance of maximum flux from a clinical and toxicological viewpoint. Through his systematic approach, Mike showed a parabolic relationship between maximum flux and lipophilicity, and established that this is driven mainly by variations in solubility of the solute in the stratum corneum. One of the significant strengths of Mike's work is the ability to express biological concepts in mathematical terms. He has developed mathematical models that enhance our understanding of epidermal, dermal, deep tissue permeation and follicular transport. Throughout his career Mike has been involved in pioneering new technologies both for analysing the skin barrier and influencing permeation across it. His fundamental work in the area of iontophoresis provided models that defined the parameters influencing its permeation enhancement. Mike's research has been translated into improved clinical outcomes, reduced toxicological risk and changes to the regulation of skin products.

Distance-based paper device coupled with uracil-rich DNA hydrogel for visual quantification of Uracil-DNA glycosylase.,"Wei Xue, Yunping Wu, Xiaoqian Li, Qian Zhang, Yanfang Wu, Yangyang Chang, Meng Liu","Uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG), an enzyme for repairing uracil-containing DNA damage, is crucial for maintaining genomic stability. Simple and fast quantification of UDG activity is essential for biological assay and clinical diagnosis, since its aberrant level is associated with DNA damage and various diseases. Herein, we developed a fully integrated ""sample in-signal out"" distance-based paper analytical device (dPAD) for visual quantification of UDG using a flow-controlled uracil-rich DNA hydrogel (URDH). The uracil base sites contained in the DNA hydrogel are mis-incorporated with dUTP by rolling circle amplification (RCA), which simplifies the preparation process of the functionalized hydrogel. In the presence of UDG, the uracil in URDH can be recognized and removed to induce the permeability change of URDH, resulting in the visible distance signal along the paper channel.

A separation-free paper-based hydrogel device for one-step reactive oxygen species determination by a smartphone.,"Jie Chu, Yiyi Zhang, Jingwen Li, Jun Hong, Lin Sun, Jianshe Wei","Paper-based analytical devices (PADs) are very convenient for determining biomarkers in point-of-care (POC) diagnosis while requiring sample pre-treatment or impurity separation.

The problem of over-medicalisation: How AOD disease models perpetuate inequity for young people with multiple disadvantage.,"J Bryant, G Caluzzi, A Bruun, J Sundbery, M Ferry, R M Gray, J Skattebol, J Neale, S Maclean","Young people who experience multiple disadvantage have been identified as some of the most marginalised and under-serviced people in the alcohol and other drug (AOD) system. In this paper, we draw on a range of research evidence to argue that one of the challenges in responding appropriately to the needs of these young people are models of care which seek to ameliorate 'illness' rather than promote wellness. While disease approaches have some important benefits, overly-medicalised AOD treatment responses also have negative impacts. We argue that disease models rest on understandings of substance use as an individual enterprise and thereby pay insufficient attention to the material disadvantage that shape young people's substance use, creating feelings of shame, failure and a reluctance to return to care if they continue to use. Additionally we draw on literature that shows how disease models construe young people's substance use as compulsive, perpetuating deficit views of them as irrational and failing to account for the specific meanings that young people themselves give to their substance use. By focusing on clinical solutions rather than material and relational ones, medicalised treatment responses perpetuate inequity: they benefit young people whose resources and normative values align with the treatments offered by disease models, but are much less helpful to those who are under-resourced,.

"Procreation machines: Ectogenesis as reproductive enhancement, proper medicine or a step towards posthumanism?","Johanna Eichinger, Tobias Eichinger","Full ectogenesis as the complete externalization of human reproduction by bypassing the bodily processes of gestation and childbirth can be considered the culmination of genetic and reproductive technologies. Despite its still being a hypothetical scenario, it has been discussed for decades as the ultimate means to liberate women from their reproductive tasks in society and hence finally end fundamental gender injustices generally. In the debate about the application of artificial wombs to achieve gender equality, one aspect is barely mentioned but is of crucial relevance from a medical-ethical perspective: whether and how could full ectogenesis be justified as a proper use of medicine? After characterizing the technology as a special form of human enhancement and as an extension of medical practice that goes beyond the traditional field of medicine, this paper critically assesses the theoretical possibilities of legitimizing this extension. We identify two ways of justification: either one argues that ectogenesis fulfils a proper goal of medicine (a justification we call pathologization), or one argues that the application of ectogenesis achieves a non-medical goal (which we call medicalization). Because it is important from a medical-ethical point of view to avoid an inappropriate instrumentalization or misuse of medicine and thus an undue medicalization of non-medical problems, a set of necessary conditions has to be met. It is doubtful whether full ectogenesis for non-medical purposes could fulfil these conditions. Rather, its comprehensive usage could be seen as a revolutionary modification of what it means to be human.",2020-01-01,Bioethics,"ectogenesis, gender equality, goals of medicine, human enhancement, medicalization, pathologization","biomedical enhancement, ectogenesis, ethical analysis, female, gender equity, humans, medicalization, pregnancy, reproductive techniques",10.1111/bioe.12708,"Institute for Biomedical Ethics, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland., Institute of Biomedical Ethics and History of Medicine, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."
A Holistic Approach to Determining Stereochemistry of Potential Pharmaceuticals by Circular Dichroism with β-Lactams as Test Cases.,"Marcin Górecki, Jadwiga Frelek","This paper's main objective is to show that many different factors must be considered when solving stereochemical problems to avoid misleading conclusions and obtain conclusive results from the analysis of spectroscopic properties. Particularly in determining the absolute configuration, the use of chiroptical methods is crucial, especially when other techniques, including X-ray crystallography, fail, are not applicable, or give inconclusive results. Based on various β-lactam derivatives as models, we show how to reliably determine their absolute configuration (AC) and preferred conformation from circular dichroism (CD) spectra. Comprehensive CD analysis, employing both approaches, i.e., traditional with their sector and helicity rules, and state-of-the-art supported by quantum chemistry (QC) calculations along with solvation models for both electronic (ECD) and vibrational (VCD) circular dichroism ranges, allows confident defining stereochemistry of the β-lactams studied.

Paper-supported 3D cell culture for tissue-based bioassays.,"Ratmir Derda, Anna Laromaine, Akiko Mammoto, Sindy K Y Tang, Tadanori Mammoto, Donald E Ingber, George M Whitesides","Fundamental investigations of human biology, and the development of therapeutics, commonly rely on 2D cell-culture systems that do not accurately recapitulate the structure, function, or physiology of living tissues. Systems for 3D cultures exist but do not replicate the spatial distributions of oxygen, metabolites, and signaling molecules found in tissues. Microfabrication can create architecturally complex scaffolds for 3D cell cultures that circumvent some of these limitations; unfortunately, these approaches require instrumentation not commonly available in biology laboratories. Here we report that stacking and destacking layers of paper impregnated with suspensions of cells in extracellular matrix hydrogel makes it possible to control oxygen and nutrient gradients in 3D and to analyze molecular and genetic responses. Stacking assembles the ""tissue"", whereas destacking disassembles it, and allows its analysis. Breast cancer cells cultured within stacks of layered paper recapitulate behaviors observed both in 3D tumor spheroids in vitro and in tumors in vivo: Proliferating cells in the stacks localize in an outer layer a few hundreds of microns thick, and growth-arrested, apoptotic, and necrotic cells concentrate in the hypoxic core where hypoxia-sensitive genes are overexpressed. Altering gas permeability at the ends of stacks controlled the gradient in the concentration of the O(2) and was sufficient by itself to determine the distribution of viable cells in 3D.

Active Barrier Coating for Packaging Paper with Controlled Release of Sunflower Oils.,Pieter Samyn,"The use of paper as a sustainable packaging material is favored, but it lacks sufficient barrier properties in terms of water repellence and oil resistance. Novel approaches consider active packaging materials or coatings with controlled release providing additional functionality for delivery of specific components to the surface. In this study, the development of a waterborne coating with organic nanoparticles and encapsulated sunflower oils is presented as a system for thermal release of the oil and on-demand tuning of the final barrier properties of the paper substrate. After synthesis of the nanoparticles, it seems that the encapsulation of various grades of sunflower oil (i.e., either poly-unsaturated or mono-unsaturated) strongly affects the encapsulation efficiency and thermal release profiles. The water contact angles are controlled by the oil release and chemical surface composition of the coating upon thermal heating. The oil resistance of the paper improves as a more continuous oil film is formed during thermal release. In particular, the chemical surface composition of the paper coatings is detailed by means of micro-Raman spectroscopy and surface imaging, which provide an analytical quantification tool to evaluate surface coverage, oil delivery, and variations in organic coating moieties.",2021-01-01,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)","barrier, coating, encapsulation, hydrophobicity, oleophobicity, packaging, paper, release, vegetable oil","delayed-action preparations, food packaging, nanoparticles, paper, sunflower oil, water",3561,"Analytical and Circular Chemistry, Hasselt University, 3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium."

In 2020, the WG developed and distributed a detailed questionnaire on protein non-naïve NHP reuse to the WG member companies. The WG received responses from key stakeholders including principal investigators, facility managers, animal welfare officers and research scientists. This paper's content reflects the consolidated opinion of the WG members and the questionnaire responses on the subject of NHP reuse within nonclinical programs at all stages of research and development. Many of the pharmaceutical companies represented in the working group or participating in the questionnaire have already achieved some level of NHP reuse in their nonclinical programs, but the survey results suggested that there is significant potential to increase NHP reuse further and a need to understand the considerations involved in reuse more clearly. The WG has also focused carefully on the inherent concerns and risks of implementing protein non-naive NHP reuse and has evaluated the best methods of risk assessment and decision-making. This paper presents a discussion on the challenges and opportunities surrounding protein non-naïve NHP reuse and aims to stimulate further industry dialogue on the subject and provide guidance for pharmaceutical companies to establish roadmaps and decision trees enabling increased protein non-naïve NHP reuse.

Toxicological Drug Screening using Paper Spray High-Resolution Tandem Mass Spectrometry (HR-MS/MS).,"Josiah Mckenna, Rachel Jett, Kevin Shanks, Nicholas E Manicke","Immunoassays and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) are both widely used methods for drug screening in toxicology. We investigated an alternative approach for rapid drug screening: paper spray MS (PS-MS). In paper spray, the biofluid sample is spotted onto a paper substrate. Upon application of a spray solvent and an electric potential, extraction and ionization occur directly from the paper without any need for additional sample preparation. We developed two paper spray high-resolution MS/MS targeted drug screening assays using a quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometer, one the positive ion mode and one in the negative ion mode. In the positive ion mode, over 130 drugs and drug metabolites were semi-quantitatively screened at sub-toxic concentrations in a single 2.5 min analysis. Limits of detection and calibration performances for each target compound are reported. The PS-MS/MS assay was tested on authentic postmortem specimens, and its screening ability and semi-quantitative performance were evaluated against independent LC-MS-MS screening and confirmation assays with good agreement. The paper spray MS/MS showed good qualitative agreement with LC-MS-MS; the true positive rate of paper spray MS/MS was 92%, and the true negative rate was over 98%. The quantitative results between the two methods were also acceptable for a screening application; Passing-Bablok regression yielded a slope of 1.17 and a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.996.

By developing the concept of ecology of childbirth, we intend to call into question this relational nature of the body and to recover the value of corporeality and embodiment as a language of proximity, within a theoretical framework of the ethics of difference.

This article details the development of a quantitative DNA detection device that utilizes the aggregation of polystyrene microspheres to affect the distance that microspheres wick through filter paper. The microspheres are conjugated to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) oligomers that are partially complementary to a target strand and, in the presence of the target strand, form a three-strand complex, resulting in the formation of aggregates. The higher the concentration of the target strand, the larger the aggregate, and the shorter the distance wicked by the microspheres. This behavior was investigated across a wide range of target concentrations and under different incubation times to understand aggregate formation.

How sociophenomenology of the body problematises the 'problem-oriented approach' to growth hormone treatment.,"Maria Cristina Murano, Jenny Slatman, Kristin Zeiler","This article examines how people who are shorter than average make sense of their lived experience of embodiment. It offers a sociophenomenological analysis of 10 semistructured interviews conducted in the Netherlands, focusing on if, how, and why height matters to them. It draws theoretically on phenomenological discussions of lived and objective space, intercorporeality and norms about bodies. The analysis shows that height as a lived phenomenon (1) is active engagement in space, (2) coshapes habituated ways of behaving and (3) is shaped by gendered norms and beliefs about height. Based on this analysis, the article challenges what we label as the 'problem-oriented approach' to discussions about growth hormone treatment for children with idiopathic short stature. In this approach, possible psychosocial disadvantages or problems of short stature and quantifiable height become central to the ethical evaluation of growth hormone treatment at the expense of first-hand lived experiences of short stature and height as a lived phenomenon. Based on our sociophenomenological analysis, this paper argues that the rationale for giving growth hormone treatment should combine medical and psychological assessments with investigations of lived experiences of the child. Such an approach would allow considerations not only of possible risks or disadvantages of short stature but also of the actual ways in which the child makes sense of her or his height.",2018-01-01,Medical Humanities,"child health, endocrinology including diabetes, medical ethics/bioethics, medical humanities, philosophy","attitude, body height, child, comprehension, female, growth disorders, growth hormone, hormone replacement therapy, humans, male, medicalization, netherlands, self concept",10.1136/medhum-2018-011548,"Department of Culture and Communication, Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden., Department of Culture Studies, Tilburg University, Tilburg, The Netherlands., Department of Thematic Studies: Technology and Social Change, Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden."

Ionization Suppression and Recovery in Direct Biofluid Analysis Using Paper Spray Mass Spectrometry.,"Carolina Vega, Corina Spence, Chengsen Zhang, Brandon J Bills, Nicholas E Manicke","Paper spray mass spectrometry is a method for the direct analysis of biofluid samples in which extraction of analytes from dried biofluid spots and electrospray ionization occur from the paper on which the dried sample is stored. We examined matrix effects in the analysis of small molecule drugs from urine, plasma, and whole blood. The general method was to spike stable isotope labeled analogs of each analyte into the spray solvent, while the analyte itself was in the dried biofluid. Intensity of the labeled analog is proportional to ionization efficiency, whereas the ratio of the analyte intensity to the labeled analog in the spray solvent is proportional to recovery. Ion suppression and recovery were found to be compound- and matrix-dependent. Highest levels of ion suppression were obtained for poor ionizers (e.g., analytes lacking basic aliphatic amine groups) in urine and approached -90%. Ion suppression was much lower or even absent for good ionizers (analytes with aliphatic amines) in dried blood spots. Recovery was generally highest in urine and lowest in blood.

"""A midwife at every confinement"": Midwifery and Medicalized Childbirth in Ontario and Britain, 1920-1950.",Gwenith Siobhan Cross,"This paper compares midwifery in Ontario and Britain in the first half of the 20th century. British midwives improved maternal and infant health and welfare by making childbirth a cooperative, medically managed event in conjunction with physicians. British midwives thus participated in, and contributed to, developments in obstetrics. In contrast, Ontario physicians worked to exclude midwives from participation in the modernization of birth management, relying on a narrower concept of ""medicalization"" defined as physician dominance. This study challenges the medical profession's assumptions that the exclusion of midwifery in Ontario was necessary to the medicalization of childbirth. The British alternative, where midwives were seen as partners rather than obstacles, illustrates that medicalization in the interest of infant and maternal safety could be integrated with the work of midwives.",,Canadian Bulletin Of Medical History = Bulletin Canadien D'Histoire De La Medecine,"midwifery, sage-femmerie, comparative medical history, histoire de la médecine comparée, medical professionalization, medicalization, médicalisation, professionalisation médicale","delivery, obstetric, female, history, 20th century, humans, medicalization, midwifery, ontario, parturition, pregnancy, united kingdom",10.3138/cbmh.31.2.139,"Department of History, Wilfrid Laurier University."
Hydrogel Paper-Based Analytical Devices: Separation-Free In Situ Assay of Small-Molecule Targets in Whole Blood.,"Jia Xu, Habib Khan, Li Yang","While colorimetric-based assays are very convenient to determine biomarkers in point-of-care testing (POCT), they often suffer from pretreatment procedures for separation of plasma or serum from whole blood samples. Here, we report a simple colorimetric paper-based analytical device (<i>c</i>-PAD) that is capable of performing sample-to-answer analysis by directly dropping the whole blood sample on paper. This is accomplished by utilizing sodium alginate hydrogel, which exhibits a nanometer-scale porous structure to effectively prevent the passage of large red blood cells and hemoglobin molecules, to encapsulate enzymes and chromogenic reagents. As the small targets in the blood sample enter the sensing region to trigger a chromogenic reaction, the resulting color signal is recorded by a smartphone. The interference from the red blood to the color signal can be completely avoided without the requirement of any separation process. The analytical performance of the method is evaluated by assaying glucose in real blood samples. The results show that rapid and accurate analysis can be achieved with the limit of detection as low as 0.12 mM. In addition, simultaneous detection of different targets (glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides) in whole blood can be achieved by fabricating <i>c</i>-PAD with multiple sensing regions. Owing to its several essential advantages including an extremely simple procedure for fabrication, sample-to-answer analysis without tedious pretreatment, and capability to perform high-throughput analysis, the proposed <i>c-</i>PAD will be of great value in POCT applications of whole blood samples.",2021-01-01,Analytical Chemistry,no keywords,"colorimetry, hydrogels, paper, plasma, point-of-care testing",10.1021/acs.analchem.1c03347,"Key Laboratory of Nanobiosensing and Nanobioanalysis at Universities of Jilin Province, Department of Chemistry, Northeast Normal University, 5268 Renmin Street, Changchun, Jilin130024, China., Key Laboratory of Nanobiosensing and Nanobioanalysis at Universities of Jilin Province, Department of Chemistry, Northeast Normal University, 5268 Renmin Street, Changchun, Jilin130024, China., Key Laboratory of Nanobiosensing and Nanobioanalysis at Universities of Jilin Province, Department of Chemistry, Northeast Normal University, 5268 Renmin Street, Changchun, Jilin130024, China."
'I just need to know what they are and if you can help me': Medicalization and the search for legitimacy in people diagnosed with non-epileptic attack disorder.,"Marian Peacock, Paul Bissell, Julie Ellis, Jon M Dickson, Alistair Wardrope, Richard Grünewald, Markus Reuber","This paper focuses on the struggles for legitimacy expressed by people with non-epileptic attack disorder (NEAD), one of the most common manifestations of functional neurological disorder presenting to emergency and secondary care services. Nonepileptic attacks are episodes of altered experience, awareness, and reduced self-control that superficially resemble epileptic seizures or other paroxysmal disorders but are not associated with physiological abnormalities sufficient to explain the semiological features. ""Organic"" or medicalized explanations are frequently sought by patients as the only legitimate explanation for symptoms, and consequently, a diagnosis of NEAD is often contested. Drawing on narrative interviews with patients from a small exploratory study and using a sociological perspective, we propose that a psychological account of NEAD does not provide a sufficiently legitimate path into a socially sanctioned sick role. This is a reflection of the dominance of biomedicine and the associated processes of medicalization. These processes are, we argue, the sole route to achieving legitimacy. The stress-based or psychologically oriented explanations offered to patients in contemporary medical models of the etiology of NEAD engender an uncertain identity and social position and fail to provide many patients with an account of the nature or origin of their symptoms that they find satisfactory or convincing. These struggles for legitimacy (shared by others with functional or somatoform conditions) are sharpened by key features of the contemporary healthcare landscape, such as the increasing framing of health through a lens of 'responsibilization'.",2023-01-01,Epilepsy & Behavior : E&B,"functional seizures, legitimacy, medicalization, non-epileptic attack disorder (nead)","humans, medicalization, seizures, epilepsy",10.1016/j.yebeh.2023.109485,"Edge Hill University, Faculty of Health, Social Care & Medicine, St Helens Road, Ormskirk L39 4QP, UK.

Paper test cards for presumptive testing of very low quality antimalarial medications.,"Abigail A Weaver, Marya Lieberman","Carrying out chemical analysis of antimalarials to detect low-quality medications before they reach a patient is a costly venture. Here, we show that a library of chemical color tests embedded on a paper card can presumptively identify formulations corresponding to very low quality antimalarial drugs. The presence or absence of chloroquine (CQ), doxycycline (DOX), quinine, sulfadoxine, pyrimethamine, and primaquine antimalarial medications, in addition to fillers used in low-quality pharmaceuticals, are indicated by patterns of colors that are generated on the test cards. Test card sensitivity for detection of these pure components ranges from 90% to 100% with no false positives in the absence of pharmaceutical. The color intensities from reactions characteristic of CQ or DOX allowed visual detection of formulations of these medications cut with 60% or 100% filler, although samples cut with 30% filler could not be reliably detected colorimetrically. However, the addition of unexpected fillers, even in 30% quantities, or substitute pharmaceuticals, could sometimes be detected by other color reactions on the test cards.

Chronic relationships and mental health care: global pharmaceuticals in a local healing shrine in India.,Shubha Ranganathan,"The paper explores how chronicities and chronic relationships are fostered at a state-sponsored community psychiatry clinic that has been affiliated with a Sufi shrine in western India. The clinic provides free psychotropic treatment to patients, most of whom are pilgrims visiting the shrine. While the clinic has been lauded for its collaborative approach of blending 'medicine and prayer' in the provision of mental health care, observations of clinical encounters reflect the prevalence of a strongly medicalized perspective of mental illness, where local narratives of distress are reframed as globalized categories of mental disorder, thereby permitting pharmacological intervention. Importantly, in a context where free medicines are offered just as other freebies are in development initiatives in India, this results in the creation of long-term, 'chronic' relationships with patients who only seem to return for medicines, never recovering. This paper illustrates how 'chronicity', in many ways, is built into the project from the beginning itself. It becomes evident in the assumptions of the officials and psychiatrists that mental illness is chronic, in the case files of patients that record their consultation and medication histories, and in the clinical conversations about the importance of compliance to treatment. Given that historically, community mental health emerged in the context of reducing long hospital stays and deinstitutionalizing mental health care, it is important to reflect on how these policies and practices result in the creation of a cadre of chronic out-patients.",2023-01-01,Anthropology & Medicine,"chronicities, care, pharmaceuticals, ritual, somatization","humans, mental health, anthropology, medical, mental disorders, psychiatry, pharmaceutical preparations, india",10.1080/13648470.2023.2212212,"Department of Liberal Arts, Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad, Sangareddy, India."
Integration of mental health into primary healthcare in low-income countries: avoiding medicalization.,Peter Ventevogel,"Since 2008 the World Health Organization (WHO), through its mental health Gap Action Programme, has attempted to revitalize efforts to integrate mental health into non-specialized (e.g. primary) healthcare. While this has led to renewed interest in this potential method of mental health service delivery, it has also prompted criticism. Some concerns raised are that it would contribute to the medicalization of social and psychological problems, and narrowly focus on primary care without sufficient attention given to strengthening other levels of the healthcare system, notably community-based care and care on district levels. This paper discusses seven elements that may be critical to preventing inadvertently contributing to increasing a narrow biomedical approach to mental healthcare when integrating mental health into non-specialized healthcare: (1) using task shifting approaches within a system of stepped care, (2) ensuring primary mental healthcare also includes brief psychotherapeutic interventions, (3) promote community-based recovery-oriented interventions for people with disabling chronic mental disorders, (4) conceptualizing training as a continuous process of strengthening clinical competencies through supervision, (5) engaging communities as partners in psychosocial interventions, (6) embedding shifts to primary mental healthcare within wider health policy reforms, and (7) promoting inter-sectoral approaches to address social determinants of mental health.",,"International Review Of Psychiatry (Abingdon, England)",no keywords,"delivery of health care, integrated, developing countries, humans, medicalization, mental health services, primary health care",10.3109/09540261.2014.966067,"UNHCR Geneva , Switzerland."

Trace evidence dynamics of cocaine on banknotes: A comparison study of paper and polymer banknotes.,"M A Amaral, A P Gibson, R M Morgan","It is well established that a large proportion of paper banknotes in circulation contain traces of cocaine. Being able to discriminate between the innocent transfer of illicit drug particles acquired through everyday interactions with surfaces such as banknotes, as opposed to transfer resulting from criminal activities can provide valuable intelligence that can inform an investigation. With many countries adopting polymer banknotes as legal tender, it is important to consider the transfer of cocaine from these surfaces as well as the retention of these particulates on polymer banknotes for evaluative interpretation in crime reconstruction. This comparison study assessed three contact variables (force, time, and rotation) on the transfer of cocaine particulates from paper and polymer banknotes onto a human skin proxy. The persistence of cocaine particulates was assessed through a realistic scenario which mimicked a cash transaction. Quantifiable amounts of cocaine were transferred onto the human skin proxy across all of the contacts assessed, with a greater transfer observed with contacts involving polymer banknotes and those contacts which involved rotation. Following extensive handling, cocaine persisted on both banknote types, with paper banknotes retaining larger amounts of cocaine than polymer banknotes. These findings show that cocaine can persist on both paper and polymer banknotes for extended periods of time following handling and is therefore available for transfer. This transfer then readily occurs, even when contact is brief and involves relatively small forces. A key distinction between the banknote types was that cocaine particulates are more likely to transfer from polymer banknotes due to the lower retention rate of particulates on this surface. Such insights can aid in evaluating the relevance of illicit drug particles identified on items or persons of interest in crime reconstruction approaches.",2022-01-01,Science & Justice : Journal Of The Forensic Science Society,"crime reconstruction, experimental studies, forensic science, instron electropuls, persistence, transfer","cocaine, humans, illicit drugs, paper, polymers",10.1016/j.scijus.2022.02.008,"Department of Security and Crime Science, University College London, 35 Tavistock Square, London WC1H 9EZ, United Kingdom; Centre for the Forensic Sciences, University College London, 35 Tavistock Square, London WC1H 9EZ, United Kingdom; Department of Medical Physics & Biomedical Engineering, University College London, Gower Street, London WC1E 6BT, United Kingdom.

Study of the activation level of different kinases of cells stimulated by different conditions, i.e., IL-6 stimulation, starvation, and hypoxia, was demonstrated. Moreover, rapid screening of cell signaling cascades after the stimulations of HGF, doxorubicin, and UVB irradiation was respectively conducted to simultaneously screen 40 kinases and transcription factors. Activation of multi-signaling pathways could be identified and the correlation between signaling pathways was discussed to provide further information to investigate the entire signaling network. The present technique integrates most of the tedious operations using a single paper substrate, reduces sample and reagent consumption, and shortens the time required by the entire process.

Janus Electrochemical Paper-Based Analytical Devices for Metals Detection in Aerosol Samples.,"Jaruwan Mettakoonpitak, John Volckens, Charles S Henry","Exposure to trace metals in airborne particulate matter (PM) has been linked to various adverse health effects. Quantifying metals in PM is important; however, current analytical tools tend to be bulky and expensive. A need therefore exists for more rapid, low-cost, portable tools for multiplexed determination of metals in PM. Electrochemical paper-based devices (ePADs) have been used for detecting metals in PM but require different devices and methods for different metals, making the systems more complicated than desired. Recently reported Janus ePADs offer a solution to this problem by allowing for multiple electrochemical experiments from a single sample. Here, we sought to determine if a Janus ePAD containing four independent channels and working electrodes could be used for simultaneous detection of multiple metals in PM. Online sample pretreatment in each channel during sample delivery yielded optimal conditions for each experiment. The design allows the device to conduct square-wave anodic stripping voltammetry (SWASV) and square-wave cathodic stripping voltammetry (SWCSV) for simultaneous detection of Cd, Pb, Cu, Fe, and Ni from a single sample. Two detection zones each with shared reference and counter electrodes were used for SWASV and SWCSV, respectively.

The recent increase in appearances of new psychoactive substances (NPS), derived from structural modifications of existing psychoactive substances, poses a threat to public health and forensic laboratories worldwide, as little is known about these substances. This study aimed to chemically and geographically map drugs of abuse from blotter papers seized by the Civil Police of Rio de Janeiro State (PCERJ) between 2006 and 2019. High-performance analytical techniques, such as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and Orbitrap mass spectrometry (Orbitrap-MS), combined with statistical analyses, were employed to characterize the seized samples. The most common chemical compounds in NPS found in this study were synthetic phenethylamines, i.e., molecules from the 25I-NBOH (2-(((4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethyl)amino)methyl)phenol) and 25I-NBOMe (2-(4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)ethanamine) families.

"Development, characterization, and application of paper spray ionization.","Jiangjiang Liu, He Wang, Nicholas E Manicke, Jin-Ming Lin, R Graham Cooks, Zheng Ouyang","Paper spray is developed as a direct sampling ionization method for mass spectrometric analysis of complex mixtures. Ions of analyte are generated by applying a high voltage to a paper triangle wetted with a small volume (<10 microL) of solution. Samples can be preloaded onto the paper, added with the wetting solution, or transferred from surfaces using the paper as a wipe. It is demonstrated that paper spray is applicable to the analysis of a wide variety of compounds, including small organic compounds, peptides, and proteins. Procedures are developed for analysis of dried biofluid spots and applied to therapeutic drug monitoring with whole blood samples and to illicit drug detection in raw urine samples. Limits of detection of 50 ng/mL (or 20 pg absolute) are achieved for atenolol in bovine blood. The combination of sample collection from surfaces and paper spray ionization also enables fast chemical screening at high sensitivity, for example 100 pg of heroin distributed on a surface and agrochemicals on fruit peels are detectable. Online derivatization with a preloaded reagent is demonstrated for analysis of cholesterol in human serum.

A strategy for the detection of benzodiazepine drugs using low-resolution paper-spray mass spectrometry for harm reduction drug checking.,"Allie Miskulin, Bruce Wallace, Chris Gill, Dennis Hore","The ability to detect newly emerging substances is of great importance in reducing harms for people who use drugs. New psychoactive substances including novel benzodiazepines in the illicit drug supply have been linked to high rates of overdose deaths while complicating drug checking as an overdose prevention strategy. Paper-spray mass spectrometry (PS-MS) has emerged as a novel strategy to rapidly detect trace components in street drug samples. While targeted, low-resolution PS-MS methods have proven effective, newly emerging substances are often missed. To address this, a method was applied to low-resolution full-scan PS-MS data to aid in the early detection and identification of novel benzodiazepines in the unregulated drug supply. Using the developed method, true positives rates of 0.89 and 0.75 were achieved for bromazolam and etizolam in street samples obtained in a community drug checking service.

"Defending the indefensible? Psychiatry, assisted suicide and human freedom.",Malcolm Parker,"The siege guns of the forces for change to euthanasia and assisted suicide laws have been pounding for decades, but the longstanding proscription on these practices has held out in all but a few jurisdictions. A few psychiatrists have enlisted with the challengers, but many remain on the battlements, defending the impermissibility of active assistance in dying. Given the long history of the separation of church and state and the significant secularisation of society; the recognition by the law of both acts and omissions as legal causes; lenient sentences for mercy killers; critiques of the ""psychiatriatisation"" of different aspects of life; and the consistency of public opinion, this recalcitrant stand bespeaks undercurrents and positions that are often by rationalised or camouflaged, and which call for exploration. In this paper, I examine connections between psychiatry and conceptualisations of harm, suffering and natural death; medicalisation, psychiatrisation and medical paternalism; decision-making capacity, rationality and diagnosis; recent legal developments; social pluralism; and religious intuitionism. I conclude that psychiatrists and the psychiatry profession, concerned as they are with enlarging the province of human freedom, should begin a more transparent rapprochement with those they would repel.",2013-01-01,International Journal Of Law And Psychiatry,"acts and omissions, euthanasia, freedom, medicalisation, psychiatry, religion","humans, medicalization, pain, personal autonomy, psychiatry, stress, psychological, suicide, assisted",10.1016/j.ijlp.2013.06.007,"Mayne Medical School, 288 Herston Road, Herston, Queensland 4006, Australia; School of Medicine, University of Queensland, Australia.

Terahertz-spectroscopy for non-destructive determination of crystallinity of L-tartaric acid in smartFilms® and tablets made from paper.,"Jan Ornik, Daniel Knoth, Martin Koch, Cornelia M Keck","Newly developed active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) often experience low solubility in aqueous media and thus possess poor oral bioavailability. The SmartFilm®-technology is a novel approach to overcome poor solubility. The technique uses commercial paper in which API can be loaded in amorphous state, thus increasing dissolution rate dc/dt and solubility c<sub>s</sub> when compared to bulk material. However, the preservation of the amorphous state is a prerequisite for an efficient use of the smartFilm-technology and thus the crystalline state needs to be inspected during storage. Preferably, this should be done non-destructively. Traditional techniques, such as x-ray diffraction (XRD) or differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), do not allow for non-destructive crystallinity investigations, whereas Terahertz (THz) spectroscopy is a non-destructive technique, that is sensitive to the crystalline state of many molecular crystals. Therefore, the potential of THz-spectroscopy for crystallinity state inspection of API in smartFilms and tablets made from smartFilms was investigated in this study. The THz results obtained were compared to results obtained from XRD and DSC measurements. Whereas DSC measurements failed to reliably detect crystalline API in the smartFilms, XRD and THz-spectroscopy showed similar results and revealed that it was possible to prepare smartFilms loaded with >23% (w/w) amorphous API.

"Bismuth-Based, Disposable Sensor for the Detection of Hydrogen Sulfide Gas.","Samuel M Rosolina, Thomas S Carpenter, Zi-Ling Xue","A new sensor for the detection of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas has been developed to replace commercial lead(II) acetate-based test papers. The new sensor is a wet, porous, paper-like substrate coated with Bi(OH)3 or its alkaline derivatives at pH 11. In contrast to the neurotoxic lead(II) acetate, bismuth is used due to its nontoxic properties, as Bi(III) has been a reagent in medications such as Pepto-Bismol. The reaction between H2S gas and the current sensor produces a visible color change from white to yellow/brown, and the sensor responds to ≥ 30 ppb H2S in a total volume of 1.35 L of gas, a typical volume of human breath. The alkaline, wet coating helps the trapping of acidic H2S gas and its reaction with Bi(III) species, forming colored Bi2S3. The sensor is suitable for testing human bad breath and is at least 2 orders of magnitude more sensitive than a commercial H2S test paper based on Pb(II)(acetate)2. The small volume of 1.35-L H2S is important, as the commercial Pb(II)(acetate)2-based paper requires large volumes of 5 ppm H2S gas. The new sensor reported here is inexpensive, disposable, safe, and user-friendly.

Analysing the ethics of breast cancer overdiagnosis: a pathogenic vulnerability.,Wendy A Rogers,"Breast cancer screening aims to help women by early identification and treatment of cancers that might otherwise be life-threatening. However, breast cancer screening also leads to the detection of some cancers that, if left undetected and untreated, would not have damaged the health of the women concerned. At the time of diagnosis, harmless cancers cannot be identified as non-threatening, therefore women are offered invasive breast cancer treatment. This phenomenon of identifying (and treating) non-harmful cancers is called overdiagnosis. Overdiagnosis is morally problematic as it leads to overall patient harm rather than benefit. Further, breast cancer screening is offered in a context that exaggerates cancer risk and screening benefit, minimises risk of harm and impedes informed choice. These factors combine to create pathogenic vulnerability. That is, breast cancer screening exacerbates rather than reduces women's vulnerability and undermines women's agency.

For the child, obesity often involves major social challenges.

Disconnectedness from the here-and-now: a phenomenological perspective as a counteract on the medicalisation of death wishes in elderly people.,"Els Van Wijngaarden, Carlo Leget, Anne Goossensen","When elderly people are ideating on manners to end their lives, because they feel life is over and no longer worth living, it is important to understand their lived experiences, thoughts and behaviour in order to appropriately align care, support and policy to the needs of these people.

DNA Tetrahedra-Cross-linked Hydrogel Functionalized Paper for Onsite Analysis of DNA Methyltransferase Activity Using a Personal Glucose Meter.,"Xin Gao, Xiuyuan Li, Xinzhi Sun, Jingyan Zhang, Yuecan Zhao, Xiaojuan Liu, Feng Li","Despite the recent developments on the construction of point-of-care testing (POCT) devices, it is still a big challenge to build portable POCT tools for simple, sensitive, selective, and quantitative determination of disease-related biomarkers. With this in mind, we developed a simple and user-friendly POCT tool for onsite analysis of DNA adenine methyltransferase (Dam) activity by using DNA tetrahedra-based hydrogel to trap glucose-producing enzymes for target recognition and signal transduction. The enzyme-encapsulated DNA hydrogel and the substrate of enzyme were separately modified on papers and then combined onto a commercial glucose test strip for the sensitive evaluation of Dam activity via using a personal glucose meter (PGM) for quantitative signal readout. Taking advantage of the great amount of enzyme entrapped in DNA hydrogel and the high signal amplification ability of enzyme, this POCT tool is capable of highly sensitive and selective determination of Dam activity with a direct detection limit down to 0.001 U/mL, which is superior to that of most previously reported biosensors. Furthermore, this device can also be applied to screen inhibitor and analyze Dam activity in spiked serum samples, indicating the great potential for clinical practice and diagnostic applications. Additionally, all the reactions for Dam assay are performed on paper, which is simple and deliverable to end-users for medical diagnostics at home or in-field.",2020-01-01,Analytical Chemistry,no keywords,"blood glucose, blood glucose self-monitoring, cross-linking reagents, dna, humans, hydrogels, paper, particle size, point-of-care testing, site-specific dna-methyltransferase (adenine-specific), surface properties",10.1021/acs.analchem.0c00018,"College of Chemistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Qingdao Agricultural University, Qingdao 266109, P.

A tutorial translation of the description of the historically first polymer drug conjugate and its in vivo evaluation.,Robert Luxenhofer,"Preamble Polymer-drug conjugates have been intensively investigated for several decades, and even though their clinical success still lags behind the promise many researchers have placed in them, they are a mainstay in the fields of polymer therapeutics or nanomedicine. For many in the field, the seminal perspective paper by Helmut Ringsdorf from 1975 marks the beginning of this field of research. With more than one thousand citations, this paper has indubitably affected and inspired generations of researchers in the field, including the author of this translation. However, it is not the first paper describing the concept of polymer-drug conjugates. Some twenty years earlier, Horst Jatzkewitz described in two outstanding articles probably the historically first polymer-drug conjugates, detailed its synthesis, characterization and even first in vivo experiments. The results, carefully re-interpreted through the eyes of a scientist of the 21st century, clearly highlight several issues that need to be taken into consideration when designing polymer-drug conjugates. However, despite the pioneering nature of this paper, it is all but forgotten by the scientific community. In the author's opinion, Horst Jatzkewitz and these papers clearly did not receive the attention and praise they deserve. Whether this was because these paper were much ahead of it´s time, or because it was published in German language, or for some other reason, we cannot know. However, these papers are, in my opinion, an excellent piece of work that should be known more widely and available to students and experts world-wide, which is why the author decided to translate it. Also, to give some more context and to help understand some outdated terms or concepts, additional comments and explanations are added throughout.

Microfluidic paper-based analytical device for particulate metals.,"Mallory M Mentele, Josephine Cunningham, Kirsten Koehler, John Volckens, Charles S Henry","A microfluidic paper-based analytical device (μPAD) fabricated by wax printing was designed to assess occupational exposure to metal-containing aerosols. This method employs rapid digestion of particulate metals using microliters of acid added directly to a punch taken from an air sampling filter. Punches were then placed on a μPAD, and digested metals were transported to detection reservoirs upon addition of water. These reservoirs contained reagents for colorimetric detection of Fe, Cu, and Ni. Dried buffer components were used to set the optimal pH in each detection reservoir, while precomplexation agents were deposited in the channels between the sample and detection zones to minimize interferences from competing metals. Metal concentrations were quantified from color intensity images using a scanner in conjunction with image processing software. Reproducible, log-linear calibration curves were generated for each metal, with method detection limits ranging from 1.0 to 1.5 μg for each metal (i.e., total mass present on the μPAD). Finally, a standard incineration ash sample was aerosolized, collected on filters, and analyzed for the three metals of interest. Analysis of this collected aerosol sample using a μPAD showed good correlation with known amounts of the metals present in the sample.

Lateral Flow Assay Based on Paper-Hydrogel Hybrid Material for Sensitive Point-of-Care Detection of Dengue Virus.,"Jane Ru Choi, Kar Wey Yong, Ruihua Tang, Yan Gong, Ting Wen, Hui Yang, Ang Li, Yook Chin Chia, Belinda Pingguan-Murphy, Feng Xu","Paper-based devices have been broadly used for the point-of-care detection of dengue viral nucleic acids due to their simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and readily observable colorimetric readout. However, their moderate sensitivity and functionality have limited their applications. Despite the above-mentioned advantages, paper substrates are lacking in their ability to control fluid flow, in contrast to the flow control enabled by polymer substrates (e.g., agarose) with readily tunable pore size and porosity. Herein, taking the benefits from both materials, the authors propose a strategy to create a hybrid substrate by incorporating agarose into the test strip to achieve flow control for optimal biomolecule interactions. As compared to the unmodified test strip, this strategy allows sensitive detection of targets with an approximately tenfold signal improvement. Additionally, the authors showcase the potential of functionality improvement by creating multiple test zones for semi-quantification of targets, suggesting that the number of visible test zones is directly proportional to the target concentration. The authors further demonstrate the potential of their proposed strategy for clinical assessment by applying it to their prototype sample-to-result test strip to sensitively and semi-quantitatively detect dengue viral RNA from the clinical blood samples.

"Lower-dose prescribing: minimizing ""side effects"" of pharmaceuticals on society and the environment.","Christian G Daughton, Ilene Sue Ruhoy","The prescribed use of pharmaceuticals can result in unintended, unwelcomed, and potentially adverse consequences for the environment and for those not initially targeted for treatment. Medication usage frequently results in the collateral introduction to the environment (via excretion and bathing) of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), bioactive metabolites, and reversible conjugates. Imprudent prescribing and non-compliant patient behavior drive the accumulation of unused medications, which pose major public health risks from diversion as well as risks for the environment from unsound disposal, such as flushing to sewers. The prescriber has the unique wherewithal to reduce each of these risks by modifying various aspects of the practice of prescribing. By incorporating consideration of the potential for adverse environmental impacts into the practice of prescribing, patient care also could possibly be improved and public health better protected. Although excretion of an API is governed by its characteristic pharmacokinetics, this variable can be somewhat controlled by the prescriber in selecting APIs possessing environment-friendly excretion profiles and in selecting the lowest effective dose. This paper presents the first critical examination of the multi-faceted role of drug dose in reducing the ambient levels of APIs in the environment and in reducing the incidence of drug wastage, which ultimately necessitates disposal of leftovers. Historically, drug dose has been actively excluded from consideration in risk mitigation strategies for reducing ambient API levels in the environment. Personalized adjustment of drug dose also holds the potential for enhancing therapeutic outcomes while simultaneously reducing the incidence of adverse drug events and in lowering patient healthcare costs. Optimizing drug dose is a major factor in improving the sustainability of health care. The prescriber needs to be cognizant that the ""patient"" encompasses the environment and other ""bystanders,"" and that prescribed treatments can have unanticipated, collateral impacts that reach far beyond the healthcare setting.",2012-01-01,The Science Of The Total Environment,no keywords,"dose-response relationship, drug, drug prescriptions, drug-related side effects and adverse reactions, environmental pollutants, humans, pharmaceutical preparations",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.10.092,"Environmental Sciences Division, National Exposure Research Laboratory, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 944 East Harmon Avenue, Las Vegas, NV 89119, USA. daughton.christian@epa.gov"
Quantitative analysis of finasteride tablets dissolution content with non-isotopically labeled internal standard by paper spray ionization mass spectrometry.,"Yang Liu, Yanan Zhou, Yandong Dai, Zhuang Zhao, Lan He, Qingsheng Zhang","Paper spray ionization, one of the ambient mass spectrometry technologies, has been developed to characterize the content of drugs in various complex matrixes including urine, whole blood, dissolution solutions, and so on.

"'Sometimes, it's easier to write the prescription': physician and patient accounts of the reluctant medicalisation of sleeplessness.",Mairead Eastin Moloney,"The medicalisation of sleep is a rich and growing area of sociological interest. Previous research suggests that medicalisation is occurring within the context of physician office visits, but the inner workings remain unclear. This study is the first to provide perspectives on the office visit interaction from both sleepless patients (n = 27) and the physicians (n = 8) who treat them. Analyses of semi-structured qualitative interviews reveal that sleep-related conversations are typically patient-initiated in routine office visits. Physicians and patients conceptualised insomnia as a symptom of another issue (depression), an everyday problem of living (stress) or the result of a natural life process (aging). Lack of sleep was not necessarily linked to daytime impairment. Even though sleep aids were routinely requested and prescribed, patients and physicians consistently expressed attitudes of reluctance toward the use of sedative hypnotics. I call this a case of 'reluctant medicalisation' and highlight the liminal space between pathology and normalcy inhabited by patients and physicians. I also build on recent work acknowledging the dynamics between macro and micro levels of medicalisation and illustrate the influence of multilevel 'engines' (consumerism, biotechnology, managed care and physicians) in patients' and physicians' accounts.

Hormone treatment of children and adolescents with gender dysphoria: an ethical analysis.,Brendan S Abel,"In the context of transgender health, most people are not comfortable with allowing a twelve-year-old child with gender dysphoria to elect to undergo gender reassignment surgery. The likelihood is too high that the child would be unable to fully comprehend the scope of a decision that carries significant, permanent consequences, particularly because the decision to surgically change gender is based upon a conception of gender that can fluctuate during adolescent years. Conversely, however, most people would not contend that this fluidity is reason to wholly deny certain medical care such as hormonal treatments to transgender youth, a demographic with extremely high rates of violent behavior, self-harm, and suicide. This paper will explore ethical considerations to this emerging debate of what therapeutic options should be offered to transgender children and adolescents. Pediatric endocrinologists have been treating gender dysphoric adolescents with puberty-suppressing drugs and, to a lesser extent, with cross-sex hormone therapies for more than twenty years. Clinicians and thought leaders have mentioned ethical components of this emerging practice in the few cohort studies and clinical review articles about the subject. However, ethics have generally been a secondary consideration in the medical academic literature.

Analytical characterization of three hallucinogenic N-(2-methoxy)benzyl derivatives of the 2C-series of phenethylamine drugs.,"Dariusz Zuba, Karolina Sekuła","This publication reports analytical properties of three new hallucinogenic substances identified in blotter papers seized from the drug market, namely 25D-NBOMe [2-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylphenyl)-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)ethanamine], 25E-NBOMe [2-(4-ethyl-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)ethanamine] and 25G-NBOMe [2-(2,5-dimethoxy-3,4-dimethylphenyl)-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)ethanamine]. These substances are N-(2-methoxy)benzyl derivatives of the 2C-series of phenethylamine drugs. The applied procedure covered a variety of analytical methods, including gas chromatography with electron impact mass spectrometry (GC-EI-MS; without derivatization and after derivatization with trifluoroacetic anhydride (TFAA)), liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-QTOF-MS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which made it possible to identify the active components unequivocally. The GC-MS spectra of analyzed compounds were very similar, with dominant ions observed at m/z = 150, 121, and 91. The remaining ions were analogous to those observed for parent substances, namely 2C-D, 2C-E, 2C-G, but their intensities were low. Derivatization allowed determination of molecular masses of the investigated substances. Their exact masses and chemical formulas were confirmed by LC-QTOF-MS experiments and the fragmentation patterns of these compounds following ESI were determined. The tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) experiments confirmed that the studied substances were N-(2-methoxy)benzyl derivatives of the 2C-series compounds.

Sustainable Stability-Indicating spectra manipulations for the concurrent quantification of a novel Anti-COVID-19 drug and its active Metabolite: Green profile assessment.,"Michael Gamal Fawzy, Ebraam B Kamel","Millions of individuals have lost their lives and changed their routines as a direct consequence of exposure to the coronavirus (Covid-19). Molnupiravir (MOL) is an orally bioavailable tiny molecule antiviral prodrug that is effective for curing the coronavirus that produces serious acute respiratory disorder (SARS-CoV-2). Fully green-assessed stability-indicating simple spectrophotometric methods have been developed and fully validated as per ICH criteria. The potential impact of degradation products of drug components on the safety and efficacy of a medication's shelf life is likely to be negligible. The field of pharmaceutical analysis necessitates various stability testing under different conditions. The conduct of such inquiries affords the prospect of predicting the most probable routes of degradation and ascertaining the inherent stability characteristics of the active drugs. Consequently, a surge in demand arose for the creation of an analytical methodology that could consistently measure the degradation products and/or impurities that may be present in pharmaceuticals. Herein, five smart and simple spectrophotometric data manipulation techniques have been produced for the concurrent estimation of MOL and its active metabolite as its possible acid degradation product namely; N-hydroxycytidine (NHC). Structure confirmation of NHC build-up through IR, MS and NMR analyses. All current techniques verified linearity ranging from 10 to 150 μg/ml and 10-60 μg/ml for MOL and NHC, respectively. The limit of quantitation (LOQ) values were in the range of 4.21-9.59 μg/ml, while the limit of detection (LOD) values were ranging from 1.38 - 3.16 μg/ml. The current methods were evaluated in terms of greenness by four assessing methods and confirmed to be green. The significant novelty of these methods depends on their being the first environmentally soundness stability-indicating spectrophotometric approaches for the concurrent estimation of MOL and its active metabolite, NHC. Also, the preparation of purified NHC delivers significant cost savings, instead of purchasing an expensive ingredient. These smart methods were utilized for analyzing the pharmaceutical dosage form which may be of great benefit to the pharmaceutical market.",2023-01-01,"Spectrochimica Acta.

Bridging papermaking and hydrogel production: Nanoparticle-loaded cellulosic hollow fibers with pitted walls as skeleton materials for multifunctional electromagnetic hydrogels.,"Zhongfei Yuan, Na Cheng, Jianqiang Li, Hongyang Yuan, Jianmin Peng, Xueren Qian, Yonghao Ni, Zhibin He, Jing Shen","Electromagnetic hydrogels have attracted significant attention due to their vast potential in soft robotics, biomedical engineering, and energy harvesting. To facilitate future commercialization via large-scale industrial processes, we present a facile concept that utilizes the specialized knowledge of papermaking to fabricate hydrogels with multifunctional electromagnetic properties. The principles of papermaking wet end chemistry, which involves the handling of interactions among cellulosic fibers, fines, polymeric additives, and other components in aqueous systems, serves as a key foundation for this concept. Notably, based on these principles, the versatile use of chemical additives in combination with cellulosic materials enables the tailored design of various products. Our methodology exploits the unique hierarchically pitted and hollow tube-like structures of papermaking grade cellulosic fibers with discernible pits, enabling the incorporation of magnetite nanoparticles through lumen loading. By combining microscale softwood-derived cellulosic fibers with additives, we achieve dynamic covalent interactions that transform the cellulosic fiber slurry into an impressive hydrogel. The cellulosic fibers act as a skeleton, providing structural support within the hydrogel framework and facilitating the dispersion of nanoparticles. In accordance with our concept, the typical hydrogel exhibits combined attributes, including electrical conductivity, self-healing properties, pH responsiveness, and dynamic rheologic behavior. Our approach not only yields hydrogels with interesting properties but also aligns with the forefront of advanced cellulosic material applications. These materials hold the promise in remote strain sensing devices, electromagnetic navigation systems, contactless toys, and flexible electronic devices. The concept and findings of the current work may shed light on materials innovation based on traditional pulp and paper processes.

Double-Color Lanthanide Metal-Organic Framework Based Logic Device and Visual Ratiometric Fluorescence Water Microsensor for Solid Pharmaceuticals.,"Long Yu, Qutong Zheng, Heng Wang, Chenxi Liu, Xiaoqing Huang, Yuxiu Xiao","Water is one of the most widespread impurities and contaminants for pharmaceuticals and chemical products. A simple, fast and reliable water assay method is of high significance for the pharmaceutical and chemical manufacturing industries. In this work, lanthanide metal-organic framework Eu-dipicolinic acid/2-aminophthalic acid (Eu-DPA/PTA-NH<sub>2</sub>) was prepared as a double-color ratiometric fluorescent water sensor, which shows ultrasensitive (limit of detection 0.01% v/v) and linear broad-range (0-100% v/v) response to water. An innovative analytical device based on a one-to-two logic gate was constructed by using the water content and the two fluorescence responses as the input and output signals, respectively. The direct analysis of water content can be achieved by the four output types, NOT (0, 1), PASS 0 (0, 0), PASS 1 (1, 1), and YES (1, 0). Importantly, the metal-organic framework (MOF)-loaded fiber paper was prepared as a microsensor, and a water assay tube was designed for rapid water detection of solid pharmaceuticals via ratiometric chromaticity, coupled with a portable visual determination device. The paper-based microsensor is response-rapid (20 s), long-term stable (at least 30 days), and can achieve the accurate (relative error <9.8%) visual assay of trace water in solid pharmaceuticals. To our knowledge, this is the first time to report an MOF-based double-color ratiometric fluorescent water sensor, a water analytical logic device, and a paper-based water microsensor for point-of-care visual water assay in solid samples via ratiometric chromaticity.",2019-01-01,Analytical Chemistry,no keywords,"biosensing techniques, color, fluorescence, fluorescent dyes, lanthanoid series elements, metal-organic frameworks, paper, pharmaceutical preparations, spectrometry, fluorescence, water, water pollutants, chemical",10.1021/acs.analchem.9b04575,"Key Laboratory of Combinatorial Biosynthesis and Drug Discovery (Ministry of Education), and Wuhan University School of Pharmaceutical Sciences , Wuhan 430071 , China., Key Laboratory of Combinatorial Biosynthesis and Drug Discovery (Ministry of Education), and Wuhan University School of Pharmaceutical Sciences , Wuhan 430071 , China., Key Laboratory of Combinatorial Biosynthesis and Drug Discovery (Ministry of Education), and Wuhan University School of Pharmaceutical Sciences , Wuhan 430071 , China., Hubei Institute for Drug Control, and Hubei Engineering Research Center for Drug Quality Control , Wuhan 430075 , China., Key Laboratory of Combinatorial Biosynthesis and Drug Discovery (Ministry of Education), and Wuhan University School of Pharmaceutical Sciences , Wuhan 430071 , China., Key Laboratory of Combinatorial Biosynthesis and Drug Discovery (Ministry of Education), and Wuhan University School of Pharmaceutical Sciences , Wuhan 430071 , China."
An examination of the medicalization trend in female genital cutting in Egypt: How does it relate to a girl's risk of being cut?,"Van Eekert Nina, Biegel Naomi, Gadeyne Sylvie, Van De Velde Sarah","Female Genital Cutting (FGC) is increasingly being performed by trained health professionals. International, national, and local institutions strongly oppose this medicalization trend, arguing that the involvement of health-care providers in the performance of FGC will counteract efforts to eliminate the practice. However, no empirical research to date has confirmed or refuted this claim. Therefore, it remains unclear how the medicalization of FGC relates to changes in the prevalence of the practice. In the current paper, we aim to fill this gap in the literature by examining the association between this medicalization trend and the risk of FGC. We focus on Egypt because of its high medicalization and prevalence rates and its unique history of FGC legislation. We performed a discrete-time event-history regression analysis combined with governorate fixed effects using the Egyptian Demographic Health Surveys from 2005, 2008, and 2014 (N = 49,273 daughters clustered within 29,810 mothers). Our results show that increasing medicalization rates coexist with decreasing prevalence rates. This effect is particularly pronounced in a context where a substantial number of cuts were medicalized (estimated at 40% and above). This effect is significantly more pronounced in higher educated mothers. Our study thus shows that the medicalization of FGC can coincide with decreasing prevalence rates of FGC. Medicalization of FGC may take place in a context where an awareness of the health hazards related to FGC is more pronounced, thereby also discouraging the practice as a whole. In addition, the medicalization of FGC may make the practice more individualized and therefore reduce the incentives for FGC.",2020-01-01,Social Science & Medicine (1982),"egypt, female circumcision, female genital cutting, female genital mutilation/cutting, harm reduction, health stratification, medicalization, social norm, status symbol","circumcision, female, egypt, female, humans, medicalization, mothers, nuclear family",10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113024,"Centre for Population, Family and Health, University of Antwerp, Belgium; International Centre for Reproductive Health, Ghent University, Belgium.

We compare a UV/vis spectrophotometry method with a color change recorded on a microfluidic paper-based analytical device (μPAD). Detection is based on the pharmaceutical compounds coupling with diazotized 4-aminoacetophenone (DAAP) under alkaline conditions to produce colored azo-dye products.

Influence of ZnO morphology on the capability of portable paper-based electrospray ionization mass spectrometry to determine therapeutic drugs in complex matrices.,"Yan Zhang, Yajie Huang, Yun Li, Zhiming Zhang, Qianqian Zuo, Yajun Zheng, Zhiping Zhang","Adsorbents play a significant role in enhancing the analytical sensitivity of target analytes in complex samples by mitigating matrix effects. In our recent report, ZnO stood out among various adsorbents to determine target therapeutic drugs in complex biological matrices when applied for portable paper-based electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PPESI-MS). However, the influence of the morphology of ZnO on the performance of PPESI-MS is elusive. Herein, different morphologies of ZnO particles were prepared via co-precipitation or ultrasonic methods, and their capability to determine different therapeutic drugs in serum were systemically investigated. The results demonstrated that flower-shaped ZnO gave a superior capacity, and its analysis sensitivity was 2.9-12.8-fold higher than those achieved with other ZnO morphologies. Further characterization revealed that the unique performance of flower-shaped ZnO was closely associated with its favorable desorption behavior to drugs, small spray plume, and few spray emitters at the tip of coated paper substrate. To illustrate the potential of flower-shaped ZnO, its coated paper was used as a substrate for the determination of various drugs in complex matrices such as serum, and a limit of detection as low as 2 pg mL<sup>-1</sup> was achieved.

Binder-block copolymer micelle interactions in bactericidal filter paper.,"Nura Mansur-Azzam, Su Gyeong Woo, Adi Eisenberg, Theo G M Van De Ven","We previously produced a bactericidal filter paper loaded with PAA47-b-PS214 block copolymer micelles containing the biocide triclosan (TCN), using cationic polyacryamide (cPAM) as a binder. However, we encountered a very slow filtration, resulting in long bacteria deactivation times. Slow drainage occurred only when the filter paper was left to dry. It appears that the filter paper with cPAM and micelles develops hydrophobic properties responsible for this very slow filtration. Three approaches were taken to accelerate the very slow drainage all based on modification of binder-micelle interactions: (i) keeping the micelles wet, (ii) modification of the corona, and (iii) replacing cPAM with smaller and more highly charged cationic poly(isopropanol dimethylammonium) chloride (PIDMAC). In all cases, the drainage time of bactericidal filter paper became close to that of untreated filter paper, without decreasing its efficiency. Moreover, replacing cPAM with PIDMAC led to a much more efficient bactericidal filter paper that reduced bacteria viability by more than 6 orders of magnitude.

NPS illegally commercialized in blotter papers mimicking the most common form of LSD consumption, with a great variability of colours and symbols, have largely increased worldwide, including in Brazil, becoming an important emerging public health issue. In this study, we have evaluated the presence and profile of NPS in blotters seized in the State of Santa Catarina, Brazil, over the period of 2011 to 2017. The state government criminal forensics staff has performed gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) analyses in order to determine the chemical composition of the blotters.

Sub-ppt Mass Spectrometric Detection of Therapeutic Drugs in Complex Biological Matrixes Using Polystyrene-Microsphere-Coated Paper Spray.,"Teng Wang, Yajun Zheng, Xiaoting Wang, Daniel E Austin, Zhiping Zhang","Polystyrene (PS) is a class of polymer materials that offers great potential for various applications. However, the applications of PS microspheres in paper spray mass spectrometry are largely underexplored. Herein we prepared a series of PS microspheres via a simple dispersion polymerization and then used them as coating materials for paper spray mass spectrometry (MS) in high-sensitivity analysis of various therapeutic drugs in complex biological matrixes. In the preparation of PS-coated papers, the coating method was found playing a key role in determining the performance of the resulting paper substrate in addition to other parameters (e.g., starch type and amount, PS coating amount, and spray solvent). We also found that as a solvent was applied on PS-coated paper for paper spray, the analytes of interest would be first extracted out and then moved to the tip of paper triangle for spray along with the applied solvent. In the process, the surface energy of PS particles had a strong impact on the desorption performance of analytes from PS-coated paper substrate, and the PS with a high surface energy favored the elution of analytes to allow a high MS sensitivity. When the prepared PS coated paper was used as a substrate for paper spray, it gave high sensitivity in analysis of therapeutic drugs in various biological matrixes such as whole blood, serum, and urine with excellent repeatability and reproducibility. In contrast to uncoated filter paper, an improvement of 10-546-fold in sensitivity was achieved using PS-coated paper for paper spray, and an estimated lower limit of quantitation (LLOQs) in the range of 0.004-0.084 ng mL<sup>-1</sup> was obtained.

Combining the geometry of folded paper with liquid-infused polymer surfaces to concentrate and localize bacterial solutions.,"Daniel P Regan, Chloe Lilly, Abigail Weigang, Liza R White, Emily J Leclair, Alexander Collins, Caitlin Howell","Point-of-care (POC) detection and diagnostic platforms provide critical information about health and safety conditions in austere and resource-limited settings in which medical, military, and disaster relief operations are conducted. In this work, low-cost paper materials commonly used in POC devices are coated with liquid-infused polymer surfaces and folded to produce geometries that precisely localize complex liquid samples undergoing concentration by evaporation. Liquid-infused polymer surfaces were fabricated by infusing silicone-coated paper with a chemically compatible polydimethylsiloxane oil to create a liquid overlayer. Tests on these surfaces showed no remaining bacterial cells after exposure to a sliding droplet containing a concentrated solution of Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus, while samples without a liquid layer showed adhesion of both microdroplets and individual bacterial cells. Folding of the paper substrates with liquid-infused polymer surfaces into several functional 3D geometries enabled a clean separation and simultaneous concentration of a liquid containing rhodamine dye into discrete, predefined locations. When used with bacteria, which are known for their ability to adhere to nearly any surface type, functional geometries with liquid-infused polymer surfaces concentrated the cells at levels significantly higher than geometries with dry control surfaces. These results show the potential of synergistically combining paper-based materials with liquid-infused polymer surfaces for the manipulation and handling of complex samples, which may help the future engineering of POC devices.",2019-01-01,Biointerphases,no keywords,"bacterial adhesion, bacteriological techniques, escherichia coli, paper, polymers, staphylococcus aureus, surface properties, suspensions",10.1116/1.5114804,"Department of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering, University of Maine, 5737 Jenness Hall, Orono, Maine 04469., Department of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering, University of Maine, 5737 Jenness Hall, Orono, Maine 04469., Department of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering, University of Maine, 5737 Jenness Hall, Orono, Maine 04469., Department of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering, University of Maine, 5737 Jenness Hall, Orono, Maine 04469., Department of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering, University of Maine, 5737 Jenness Hall, Orono, Maine 04469., Department of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering, University of Maine, 5737 Jenness Hall, Orono, Maine 04469., Department of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering, University of Maine, 5737 Jenness Hall, Orono, Maine 04469."
Silica coated paper substrate for paper-spray analysis of therapeutic drugs in dried blood spots.,"Zhiping Zhang, Wei Xu, Nicholas E Manicke, R Graham Cooks, Zheng Ouyang","Paper spray is a newly developed ambient ionization method that has been applied for direct qualitative and quantitative analysis of biological samples. The properties of the paper substrate and spray solution have a significant impact on the release of chemical compounds from complex sample matrices, the diffusion of the analytes through the substrate, and the formation of ions for mass spectrometry analysis. In this study, a commercially available silica-coated paper was explored in an attempt to improve the analysis of therapeutic drugs in dried blood spots (DBS). The dichloromethane/isopropanol solvent has been identified as an optimal spray solvent for the analysis. The comparison was made with paper spray using chromatography paper as substrate with methanol/water as solvent for the analysis of verapamil, citalopram, amitriptyline, lidocaine, and sunitinib in dried blood spots. It has been demonstrated that the efficiency of recovery of the analytes was notably improved with the silica coated paper and the limit of quantitation (LOQ) for the drug analysis was 0.1 ng mL(-1) using a commercial triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. The use of silica paper substrate also resulted in a sensitivity improvement of 5-50-fold in comparison with chromatography papers, including the Whatman ET31 paper used for blood cards.

Substituted naphthoquinones as novel amino acid sensitive reagents for the detection of latent fingermarks on paper surfaces.,"R Jelly, S W Lewis, C Lennard, K F Lim, J Almog","In this paper, we present our preliminary studies into naphthoquinones as novel reagents for the detection of latent fingermarks on paper. Latent fingermarks deposited on paper substrates were treated with solutions of selected naphthoquinones in ethyl acetate/HFE-7100, with subsequent heating. The selected compounds were 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid, 1,2-naphthoquinone-4-sulfonate, 2-methoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone and 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone. All of the tested compounds yielded purple-brown visible fingermarks, which also exhibited photoluminescence when illuminated with a high intensity filtered light source at 555 nm and viewed through red goggles. Indirect heat using an oven at 150°C for 1h was found to be superior to direct heat with an iron, which while providing faster development lead to increased levels of background colouration. Luminescence spectrophotometry revealed differences in photoluminescence characteristics for fingermarks developed with the different naphthoquinones, with excitation over the range 530-590 nm.

Impedimetric quantification of cells encapsulated in hydrogel cultured in a paper-based microchamber.,"Kin Fong Lei, Chia-Hao Huang, Ngan-Ming Tsang","Recently, 3D cell culture technique was proposed to provide a more physiologically-meaningful environment for cell-based assays. With the development of microfluidics technology, cellular response can be quantified by impedance measurement technique in a real-time and non-invasive manner. However, handling of these microfluidic systems requires a trained engineering personnel and the operation is not compatible to traditional biological research laboratories. In this work, we incorporated the impedance measurement technique to paper-based 3D cell culture model and demonstrated non-invasive quantification of cells encapsulated in hydrogel during the culture course. A cellulose filter paper was patterned with an array of circular microchambers. Cells were encapsulated in hydrogel and loaded to the microchambers for culturing cells in 3D environment. At the preset schedule during the culture course, the paper was placed on a glass substrate with measurement electrodes for the impedance measurement. Cells in each microchamber was represented by impedance magnitude and cell proliferation could be studied over time. Also, conventional bio-assay was performed to further confirm the feasibility of the impedimetric quantification of cells encapsulated in hydrogel cultured in the paper-based microchamber.

Evaluation of DFO/PVP and its application to latent fingermarks development on thermal paper.,"Ya-Ping Luo, Ya-Bin Zhao, Sai Liu","A new method for improved development of latent fingermarks on thermal paper by 1,8-diazafluoren-9-one (DFO) treatment is described. Compared with conventional DFO solution, the mixed solution of DFO/PVP (polyvinylpyrrolidone) described here reduces black background staining without removing the thermosensitive layer and develops fingermarks by the reaction of DFO with amino acid deposited on the thermal paper's surface. An advantage of this approach is that the developed fluorescent fingermarks have high contrast and can be observed and photographed when excited in the 515 nm region and observed through an orange-red barrier long-pass filter with no background coloration. In addition, the method reported here does not involve any pre- or post treatment of the substrate and exhibits high sensitivity with good stability. Experimental results showed that the method was able to develop very old fingermarks, up to 154 days old, demonstrating the feasibility of using the method to develop identifiable latent fingermarks operationally. Furthermore, we extended our experiments to various types of thermal papers.

'Every bone of my body:' domestic violence and the diagnostic body.,Paige L Sweet,"Diagnostic categories for domestic violence have shifted over time, transforming from a disorder of psychological passivity and acute injury into a chronic and somatically invasive condition. This paper links these changing diagnoses to constructions of the abused body and to victim-blaming narratives. Based on an analysis of medical journal articles, this research identifies two logics that undergird domestic violence diagnoses, the body, and victim-blaming: 1) the logic of injury (1970s-1980s); and 2) the logic of health (late 1980s-present). The logic of injury is associated with overt victim-blaming, a temporally bounded and injured body, and psychological passivity. Once the feminist anti-violence movement gained mainstream credibility, however, the logic of injury fell out of favor as an explanation for domestic violence. What surfaced next was the logic of health, which is associated with chronic diagnoses and what the author calls a temporally extended body. The temporally extended body is flexible and layered, linking up past, present, and future states of disordered embodiment. The author suggests that, rather than ushering in hope and possibility via the logic of health's somatic flexibility, this abused body creates spaces into which new forms of blame and self-responsibility can take shape.",2014-01-01,Social Science & Medicine (1982),"biomedicalization, body, chronic, diagnosis, domestic violence, temporality","acute disease, battered women, chronic disease, crime victims, female, health status, humans, medicalization, mental disorders, spouse abuse, stress, psychological, wounds and injuries",10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.10.014,"Sociology, University of Illinois at Chicago, 1007 West Harrison Street (MC 312), Chicago, IL 60607-7140, United States.

Political economy of hope as a cultural facet of biomedicalization: A qualitative examination of constraints to hospice utilization among U.S. end-stage cancer patients.,"Emily Hammad Mrig, Karen Lutfey Spencer","A growing body of social science literature is devoted to describing processes of biomedicalization. The issue of biomedicalization is especially relevant for individuals suffering from end-stage cancer and hoping that aggressive end-of-life interventions, which are riddled with uncertainty around quantity or quality of life, will produce a 'cure'. To examine hospice underutilization among end-stage cancer patients, we apply the anthropological concept 'political economy of hope,' which describes how personal and collective 'hope' is associated with the political and economic structures that produce biomedicalization processes. Previous studies have examined hospice underutilization among end-stage cancer patients and have identified barriers stemming from patient and physician characteristics or health insurance reimbursement policies. Yet, these studies do not provide an organized synthesis of how barriers articulate, how they are part of the longitudinal decision-making process, or describe the sociocultural context surrounding hospice care enrollment decisions. This paper focuses on US-specific mechanisms and is based on qualitative, in-depth, interviews with physicians at an academic hospital (N = 24). We find that hospice underutilization results from a web of interconnected constraints surrounding end-stage cancer patients.

The non-positive antiretroviral gay body: the biomedicalisation of gay sex in England.,Alvaro Martinez-Lacabe,"Drawing on testimonies from oral history interviews, this paper analyses the implications of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) practices for gay men in England. Through perspectives on biomedicalisation, the paper focuses on three aspects relevant to the construction of technoscientific identities in the realm of HIV prevention: (i) the question of agency of PrEP users in the context of what has been defined as a biomedical intervention, (ii) practices of freedom framed within neoliberal narratives of personal responsibility versus responsibilisation and (iii) the governance of risk in the era of biomedicalisation. The paper concludes that biomedical governmentalities, even those shaped by the rhetoric of personal responsibility, can be understood as rationalities linked more to solidarity and <i>care of the other</i>. Despite this, the use of PrEP in England is also giving way to the configuration of new sexual scenarios shaped by zero-risk mentalities.

Beyond the medicine cabinet: an analysis of where and why medications accumulate.,"Ilene Sue Ruhoy, Christian G Daughton","Active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) from medications can enter the environment as trace contaminants, at individual concentrations generally below a part per billion (microg/L). APIs enter the environment primarily via the discharge of raw and treated sewage. Residues of unmetabolized APIs from parenteral and enteral drugs are excreted in feces and urine, and topically applied medications are washed from skin during bathing. These trace residues may pose risks for aquatic life and cause concern with regard to subsequent human exposure. APIs also enter the environment from the disposal of unwanted medications directly to sewers and trash. The relative significance of this route compared with excretion and bathing is poorly understood and has been subject to much speculation. Two major aspects of uncertainty exist: the percentage of any particular API in the environment originating from disposal is unknown, and disposal undoubtedly occurs from a variety of dispersed sources. Sources of disposal, along with the types and quantities of APIs resulting from each source, are important to understand so that effective pollution prevention approaches can be designed and implemented. Accumulation of leftover, unwanted drugs poses three major concerns: (i) APIs disposed to sewage or trash compose a diverse source of potential chemical stressors in the environment. (ii) Accumulated drugs represent increased potential for drug diversion, with its attendant risks of unintentional poisonings and abuse. (iii) Leftover drugs represent wasted healthcare resources and lost opportunities for medical treatment. This paper has four major purposes: (1) Define the processes, actions, and behaviors that control and drive the consumption, accumulation, and need for disposal of pharmaceuticals.

"Investigating sources of pharmaceutical pollution: Survey of over-the-counter and prescription medication purchasing, use, and disposal practices among university students.","Christine Vatovec, Emily Van Wagoner, Corey Evans","Pharmaceutical pollution in surface waters poses a range of risks to public health and aquatic ecosystems. Consumers contribute to pharmaceutical pollution via use and disposal of medications, though data on such behaviors is limited. This paper investigates the purchasing, use, and disposal practices among a population that has been researched only minimally to date, yet will determine pharmaceutical pollution for decades to come: young adults represented by a university student population. We employed an online, 21-question survey to examine behaviors related to pharmaceuticals among students at the University of Vermont (n = 358). Results indicate that the majority of respondents had purchased medications in the previous 12 months (94%), and had leftover drugs (61%). Contrary to previous studies of older populations, only a small proportion of students had disposed of drugs (18%); municipal trash was the primary route of drug disposal (25%), and very few students disposed drugs via flushing (1%). Less than a quarter of students were aware of drug take-back programs (24%), and only 4% had ever used take-back services. These findings indicate that the university student population may be storing a large volume of unused drugs that will require future disposal.

After a short introduction to anthropological and social gerontological literature on characteristics of ""Western"" aging: medicalization, successful, healthy and active aging, I present findings from both phases of this ethnographic fieldwork arguing that the ethnographic approach reveals the composite and complex nature of vulnerability in old age and the constant interactions between first, second and third person perspectives. Through these methodological and analytical moves a complex and empirically tenable understanding of vulnerability in old age has emerged which 1. moves beyond rigid dichotomies that have characterized the study of old age, 2. integrates individual experience, social interaction and the structural and discursive context into the analysis, and 3. reveals the complex interplay between vulnerability and agency in diverse situations and settings of old age.",2016-01-01,Journal Of Aging Studies,"active aging, denmark, ethnography, old age, vulnerability","adult day care centers, aged, aged, 80 and over, aging, anthropology, cultural, attitude to health, denmark, home care services, homes for the aged, humans, income, interpersonal relations, medicalization, perception, social marginalization, social support, vulnerable populations",10.1016/j.jaging.2016.09.002,"KORA, Danish Institute for Local and Regional Government Research, Copenhagen, Denmark.

Iron stains on paper. Can electrophoretic removal become an effective alternative to chemical cleaning?,"Emanuele Dell'Aglio, Susanne Heidi Plattner, Maria Pia Sammartino, Giovanni Visco, Luigi Campanella","Research in restoration and conservation is directed vs. more sustainable working materials, methods and technologies. Electrophoretic removal, from porous material, of undesired stains due to charged species is theoretically an interesting alternative to chemical cleaning methods, but the lack of specific and comprehensive research work leads to controversial opinions about the efficiency and the needed harmfulness for the treated objects. In this work paper, samples with artificial rust stains were subjected to electrophoretic cleaning treatments in mineral water as electrolyte. Treatments were carried out either in a bath by complete sample immersion between the distanced electrodes or by sample wetting and sandwiching between the electrodes. Evaluation of cleaning efficiency and treatment effects was based on colour change measurements (image analysis of scanned paper samples before and after the treatment and by colorimetric data via spectrophotometric measurements), investigation of morphological changes by SEM observations and folding endurance measurements.",2016-01-01,Natural Product Research,"electrophoresis, cultural heritage, green chemistry, iron stains, paper, restoration","art, colorimetry, coloring agents, electrophoresis, hydrogels, iron, paper, porosity, specimen handling",10.1080/14786419.2016.1258553,"a Department of Chemistry , Sapienza University of Rome , Rome , Italy., a Department of Chemistry , Sapienza University of Rome , Rome , Italy., a Department of Chemistry , Sapienza University of Rome , Rome , Italy., a Department of Chemistry , Sapienza University of Rome , Rome , Italy., a Department of Chemistry , Sapienza University of Rome , Rome , Italy."
Two-dimensional paper networks: programmable fluidic disconnects for multi-step processes in shaped paper.,"Barry R Lutz, Philip Trinh, Cameron Ball, Elain Fu, Paul Yager","Most laboratory assays take advantage of multi-step protocols to achieve high performance, but conventional paper-based tests (e.g., lateral flow tests) are generally limited to assays that can be carried out in a single fluidic step. We have developed two-dimensional paper networks (2DPNs) that use materials from lateral flow tests but reconfigure them to enable programming of multi-step reagent delivery sequences. The 2DPN uses multiple converging fluid inlets to control the arrival time of each fluid to a detection zone or reaction zone, and it requires a method to disconnect each fluid source in a corresponding timed sequence. Here, we present a method that allows programmed disconnection of fluid sources required for multi-step delivery. A 2DPN with legs of different lengths is inserted into a shared buffer well, and the dropping fluid surface disconnects each leg at in a programmable sequence.

Deconstructing 'barriers' to access: minority ethnic women and medicalised maternal health services in Vietnam.,"Joanna White, Pauline Oosterhoff, Nguyen Thi Huong","Low maternal health service utilisation amongst minority ethnic women in Vietnam is often attributed to 'traditional customs'. Drawing on secondary data and original, qualitative research amongst Hmong and Thai communities, this paper analyses minority behaviour related to childbirth. The informed selectivity in service attendance identified can be considered, in part, a rejection of current medicalised approaches at health facilities, where supine delivery is compulsory and family members are prohibited from attending women in labour. The paper reveals how conventional analyses of barriers to minority maternal health service utilisation inhibit scrutiny of the ways services fail to engage with or accommodate local preferences.

Cross-terminology mapping challenges: a demonstration using medication terminological systems.,"Himali Saitwal, David Qing, Stephen Jones, Elmer V Bernstam, Christopher G Chute, Todd R Johnson","Standardized terminological systems for biomedical information have provided considerable benefits to biomedical applications and research. However, practical use of this information often requires mapping across terminological systems-a complex and time-consuming process. This paper demonstrates the complexity and challenges of mapping across terminological systems in the context of medication information. It provides a review of medication terminological systems and their linkages, then describes a case study in which we mapped proprietary medication codes from an electronic health record to SNOMED CT and the UMLS Metathesaurus. The goal was to create a polyhierarchical classification system for querying an i2b2 clinical data warehouse. We found that three methods were required to accurately map the majority of actively prescribed medications. Only 62.5% of source medication codes could be mapped automatically. The remaining codes were mapped using a combination of semi-automated string comparison with expert selection, and a completely manual approach. Compound drugs were especially difficult to map: only 7.5% could be mapped using the automatic method. General challenges to mapping across terminological systems include (1) the availability of up-to-date information to assess the suitability of a given terminological system for a particular use case, and to assess the quality and completeness of cross-terminology links; (2) the difficulty of correctly using complex, rapidly evolving, modern terminologies; (3) the time and effort required to complete and evaluate the mapping; (4) the need to address differences in granularity between the source and target terminologies; and (5) the need to continuously update the mapping as terminological systems evolve.",2012-01-01,Journal Of Biomedical Informatics,no keywords,"clinical coding, electronic health records, humans, medical informatics, pharmaceutical preparations, reproducibility of results, vocabulary, controlled",10.1016/j.jbi.2012.06.005,"The University of Texas School of Biomedical Informatics at Houston, 7000 Fannin Suite 600, Houston, TX 77030, USA. hsaitwal@Apelon.com"

Sadness or depression: Making sense of low mood and the medicalization of everyday life.,"Christian Bröer, Broos Besseling","This research focusses on low mood as a generic category in everyday social interactions, outside the clinical realm and among non-patients. We examine if and how a clinical depression label and treatment are employed when low mood occurs in everyday life, which enables us to analyze the extent and content of medicalization and brings to the fore the interactional mechanisms and cultural concerns that potentially drive medicalization. The analysis is based on 316 observations of everyday life in the Netherlands. We observed and recorded interactions in which low mood was spontaneously expressed. Our paper shows that the clinical depression label resonates widely even if low mood is not fully medicalized. People de-medicalize low mood, and low mood can be un-medicalized. Our analysis thus suggests that dominance is not achieved, which nuances Horwitz and Wakefield's claim that the clinical category of depression has come to encompass all forms of low mood. Moreover, uncertainties about the meaning of low mood and about the depression label remain pragmatic concerns of everyday life. The cultural norm of happiness and active citizenship are very prominent in everyday life across medicalized and un-medicalized interactions. These norms thus seem to be a necessary but insufficient condition for medicalization. While pragmatic concerns do not seem to trigger medicalization either, one specific type of concern is consistently related to medicalization: relational conflicts. In sum, the cultural construction of low mood is not dominated by a single medical approach; however, it mirrors the diversity and uncertainties within and around the medical field.",2017-01-01,Social Science & Medicine (1982),"depression, everyday life, medicalization, observational methods, the netherlands","adult, attitude to health, depression, female, humans, male, medicalization, netherlands, philosophy, medical",10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.04.025,"University of Amsterdam, Department of Sociology, The Netherlands.

Geneticization in MIM/OMIM®? Exploring Historic and Epistemic Drivers of Contemporary Understandings of Genetic Disease.,Rachel A Ankeny,"Prior to the genomic sequencing era, the bible for those working in clinical genetics was McKusick's Mendelian Inheritance in Man (MIM), which appeared in multiple editions between the 1960s and the late 1990s. This catalogue was organized according to general patterns of inheritance and focused on phenotypes. Beginning in the mid-1980s, it was replaced by Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM®), a continuously updated catalogue documenting molecular relationships between genetic variation and phenotypic expression. This paper explores this resource's evolution with attention to how disease is distinguished from clinically irrelevant variation and how phenotypic similarities are captured in cases where there is no obvious genotypic association. It is argued that hybrid compromises are encoded into OMIM®; in addition to serving its key original purpose of being a diagnostic catalogue, it also began to record detectable variations in the genome even if they were not known to be associated with phenotypically visible disorders or even phenotypic variations. Although the impacts of geneticization have been well recognized, particularly in popular media, this example allows exploration of some of the historic, epistemic, and methodological causes that underlie tendencies toward disease geneticization in contemporary medicine, while highlighting that such gene-focused strategies may in fact be warranted in some contexts.",,The Journal Of Medicine And Philosophy,"victor mckusick, clinical genetics, disease, genetic variation, geneticization","chromosome mapping, disease, genetic diseases, inborn, genetic variation, human genetics, humans, medicalization, phenotype, reference books, medical",10.1093/jmp/jhx013,"The University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia."

Gender differences in approaches to self-management of poor sleep in later life.,"Susan Venn, Robert Meadows, Sara Arber","In this paper we seek to understand the influence of gender on the different approaches to managing poor sleep by older men and women through the conceptual framework of existing theoretical debates on medicalization, healthicization and 'personalization'. In-depth interviews undertaken between January and July 2008 with 62 people aged 65-95 who were experiencing poor sleep, revealed that the majority of older men and women resisted the medicalization of poor sleep, as they perceived sleep problems in later life were an inevitable consequence of ageing. However, older men and women engaged differently with the healthicization of poor sleep, with women far more likely than men to explore a range of alternative sleep remedies, such as herbal supplements, and were also much more likely than men to engage in behavioural practices to promote good sleep, and to avoid practices which prevented sleep. Women situated 'sleep' alongside more abstract discussions of 'diet' and health behaviours and drew on the discourses of the media, friends, family and their own experiences to create 'personalized' strategies, drawn from a paradigm of healthicization.

"Heroic struggles, criminals and scientific breakthroughs: ADHD and the medicalization of child behaviour in Australian newsprint media 1999-2009.","Valerie Harwood, Sandra Jones, Andrew Bonney, Samantha Mcmahon","There is a dearth of scholarly analysis and critique of the Australian newsprint media's role in the medicalization of child behaviour. To begin to redress this lack this paper analyses newsprint media's use of metaphors that re/describe and construct realities of ADHD with a medicalizing effect. The interdisciplinary team used the Factiva<sup>TM</sup> database to locate and review 453 articles published in Australian national and metropolitan newspapers during the decade 1999-2009. Data analysis involved generating statistical descriptions of the dataset according to attributes such as: date, state, newspaper titles and author names. This was followed by inductive analysis of article content. Content analysis revealed pervasive and striking use of metaphor in newsprint media reporting of ADHD content, especially when describing health professionals, educators, parents and children. This collection of metaphors was striking, and while the metaphors deployed were varied, this diversity seemed underscored by a common functionality that increased the risk that child behaviour was explained using medicalized knowledge. We contend that these metaphors collectively and coherently functioned to simplify and delimit meanings of children's health and behaviour to favour depictions that medicalize problems of children and childhood.",,International Journal Of Qualitative Studies On Health And Well-Being,"adhd, child behaviour, medicalization, metaphor, newsprint media","attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity, australia, child, child behavior, courage, criminals, humans, medicalization, newspapers as topic",1298262,"a School of Education , University of Wollongong , Wollongong , Australia., b Centre for Health and Social Research , Australian Catholic University , Melbourne , Australia., c School of Medicine , University of Wollongong , Wollongong , Australia., a School of Education , University of Wollongong , Wollongong , Australia."
"Medicalisation or customisation?

What exactly does customisation mean in this context; how does it relate to the medicalisation of sleep; and how salient or significant are these trends to date in the 24/7 society? These are the key questions this paper seeks to address, taking workplace napping and wakefulness promoting drugs amongst the 'healthy' as our comparative case studies. Both we argue, despite their apparent differences and embryonic status to date, provide alternative routes to broadly similar ends. Namely they customise our sleep patterns and practices to fit around the escalating temporal demands of daily life, thereby helping remedy the increasing misalignment between biological and social time. Each, moreover, seeks to improve or optimise safety, productivity and performance in late modern society, where alertness is prized, sleepiness is problematised and vigilance is valorised.

Quantitative analysis of therapeutic drugs in dried blood spot samples by paper spray mass spectrometry: an avenue to therapeutic drug monitoring.,"Nicholas Edward Manicke, Paul Abu-Rabie, Neil Spooner, Zheng Ouyang, R Graham Cooks","A method is presented for the direct quantitative analysis of therapeutic drugs from dried blood spot samples by mass spectrometry. The method, paper spray mass spectrometry, generates gas phase ions directly from the blood card paper used to store dried blood samples without the need for complex sample preparation and separation; the entire time for preparation and analysis of blood samples is around 30 s. Limits of detection were investigated for a chemically diverse set of some 15 therapeutic drugs; hydrophobic and weakly basic drugs, such as sunitinib, citalopram, and verapamil, were found to be routinely detectable at approximately 1 ng/mL. Samples were prepared by addition of the drug to whole blood.

The medicalisation of health inequalities and the English NHS: the role of resource allocation.,"Sheena Asthana, Alex Gibson, Joyce Halliday","Tackling health inequalities (HI) has become a key policy objective in England in recent years. Yet, despite the wide-ranging policy response of the 1997-2010 Labour Government, socio-economic variations in health continued to widen. In this paper, we seek to explore why. We propose that a meta-narrative has emerged in which the health problems facing England's most deprived areas, and the solution to those problems, have increasingly come to be linked to levels of National Health Service (NHS) funding. This has been, in part, a response to key shortcomings in previous rounds of resource allocation. The very significant sums of money allocated with respect to 'health inequalities' reflects and reinforces the belief that the NHS can and should play a central role in promoting health equity. This medicalisation of HI focuses attention on the role of individual risk factors that lend themselves to medical management, but effectively sidelines the macroprocesses of social inequality, legitimising the kind of society that neo-liberal government has produced in the United Kingdom - one in which health (like other assets) has become a matter of individual and not collective responsibility.",2012-01-01,"Health Economics, Policy, And Law",no keywords,"england, health care rationing, health policy, health status disparities, humans, medicalization, resource allocation, state medicine",10.1017/S1744133112000126,"Faculty of Health, Education and Society, University of Plymouth, Plymouth, UK. sasthana@plymouth.ac.uk"
Integration of paper spray ionization high-field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometry for forensic applications.,"Chia-Wei Tsai, Christopher A Tipple, Richard A Yost","Paper spray ionization (PSI) is an attractive ambient ionization source for mass spectrometry (MS) since it allows the combination of surface sampling and ionization. The minimal sample preparation inherent in this approach greatly reduces the time needed for analysis. However, the ions generated from interfering compounds in the sample and the paper substrate may interfere with the analyte ions. Therefore, the integration of PSI with high-field asymmetric ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS) is of significant interest since it should reduce the background ions entering the mass analyzer without complicating the analysis or increasing analysis time.

Determination of aerosol oxidative activity using silver nanoparticle aggregation on paper-based analytical devices.,"Wijitar Dungchai, Yupaporn Sameenoi, Orawon Chailapakul, John Volckens, Charles S Henry","Airborne particulate matter (PM) pollution significantly impacts human health, but the cellular mechanisms of PM-induced toxicity remain poorly understood. A leading hypothesis on the effects of inhaled PM involves the generation of cellular oxidative stress. To investigate PM-induced oxidative stress, analytical methods have been developed to study the chemical oxidation of dithiothreitol (DTT) in the presence of PM. Although DTT readily reacts with several forms of reactive oxygen species, this molecule is not endogenously produced in biological systems. Glutathione (GSH), on the other hand, is an endogenous antioxidant that is produced throughout the body and is directly involved in combating oxidative stress in the lungs and other tissues. We report here a new method for measuring aerosol oxidative activity that uses silver nanoparticle (AgNP) aggregation coupled to glutathione (GSH) oxidation in a paper-based analytical device. In this assay, the residual reduced GSH from the oxidation of reduced GSH to its disulfide induces the aggregation of AgNPs on a paper-based analytical device, which produces a reddish-brown product. Two methods for aerosol oxidative reactivity are presented: one based on change in color intensity using a traditional paper-based techniques and one based on the length of the color product formed using a distance-based device. These methods were validated against traditional spectroscopic assays for DTT and GSH that employ Elman's reagent. No significant difference was found between the levels measured by all three GSH methods (our two paper-based devices and the traditional method) at the 95% confidence level. PM reactivity towards GSH was less than towards DTT most likely due to the difference in the oxidation potential between the two molecules.",,The Analyst,no keywords,"aerosols, chemistry techniques, analytical, nanoparticles, oxidation-reduction, paper, silver",10.1039/c3an01235b,"Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi, Prachautid Road, Thungkru, Bangkok, 10140, Thailand."

Hydrophobization and antimicrobial activity of chitosan and paper-based packaging material.,"Nicolas Bordenave, Stephane Grelier, Veronique Coma","This study reports the elaboration of water-resistant, antimicrobial, chitosan and paper-based materials as environmentally friendly food packaging materials. Two types of papers were coated with chitosan-palmitic acid emulsions or with a blend of chitosan and O,O'-dipalmitoylchitosan (DPCT). Micromorphology studies showed that inclusion of hydrophobic compounds into the chitosan matrix was enhanced by grafting them onto chitosan and that this led to their penetration of the paper's core. Compared to chitosan-coated papers, the coating of chitosan-palmitic emulsion kept vapor-barrier properties unchanged (239 and 170 g.m(-2).d(-1) versus 241 and 161 g.m(-2).d(-1)), while the coating of chitosan-DPCT emulsion dramatically deteriorated them (441 and 442 g.m(-2).d(-1)).

Determination of color developers replacing bisphenol A in thermal paper receipts using diode array and Corona charged aerosol detection-A German market analysis 2018/2019.,"Martin Eckardt, Marie Kubicova, Duyen Tong, Thomas J Simat","Thermal papers (e.g. point of sale receipts, adhesive labels, tickets) significantly contribute to contamination of paper material cycles and the environment with substances of (eco-) toxicological concern. In particular, they contain color developers like endocrine disrupting bisphenols in typical concentrations of about 1-2 percent per weight (wt%). Bisphenol A (BPA) was used as the common color developer over the last decades, but it will be restricted for thermal paper application in the European Union to a limit of 0.02 wt% from 2020 onwards. Consequently, a variety of BPA substituents such as bisphenol S (BPS) and its derivatives gain importance in thermal paper application. In this study, a rapid, reliable and cost-effective method for identification and quantification of BPA, alternative color developers and related substances like sensitizers is presented based on HPLC separation coupled with diode array detection (DAD) and Corona charged aerosol detection (CAD). Quantification was performed with regard to the intended use of the substances in thermal papers. Besides traditional UV external calibration using reference standards, alternative quantification approaches, in particular UV chromophore concentration for BPS derivatives and CAD universal response technique for low-volatile color developers, were applied and compared in order to allow quantification without reference substances. A market analysis for intended used color developers and sensitizers was performed on thermal paper samples (n = 211) collected in Germany during 2018 and 2019. Pergafast 201 (in 41.7% of the samples) was the most common color developer with concentrations above 0.02 wt%, followed by BPA (36.0%), BPS (13.3%) and other BPS derivatives known as D8, D-90, BPS-MAE and TGSA, that are mainly present in adhesive labels.

The device was made by generating a superhydrophobic pattern, which defines channel and reservoir barriers, on a water-impermeable paper substrate, followed by loading and drying the reagents in the defined reservoirs. Different from the conventional paper-based devices that are made of water-permeable paper, the as-prepared device holds water drops in discrete reservoirs, and the water drops will not move unless the device is titled along the direction of the predefined channels. In this way, the liquid samples applied onto the device are handled as individual drops and could be stored, transported, and mixed on demand. Different from the conventional paper-based devices that use capillary force to drive liquid, our new device uses wetting and gravity as driving force.

The method involved the application of SFME for rapid extraction of trace amphetamine-type illicit drugs from whole blood and raw urine samples, followed by PS for direct MS analysis under ambient and open-air conditions. The experimental parameters including extraction solvent, extraction cycle, high voltage, and spray solvent, etc., were all investigated, and the optimized conditions showed an enhanced sensitivity of 1-2 order of magnitudes compared with PS-MS. The method showed good linearity, with correlation coefficient values (r) of no less than 0.9979 for analysis of AM, MA, and MDMA in human whole blood and raw urine without additional sample pretreatments. The limits of detection and quantification were 0.01-0.05 ng/mL and 0.05-0.2 ng/mL, respectively. Satisfactory recoveries were also obtained, with 74.2-94.9% for whole blood and 80.2-103.6% for raw urine, respectively.

Removal of copper from aqueous solution using newspaper pulp as an adsorbent.,"S Chakravarty, S Pimple, Hema T Chaturvedi, S Singh, K K Gupta","Newspaper pulp was found to be a potential adsorbent for removal of copper from aqueous medium. Detail adsorption study of Cu on newspaper pulp was investigated. Batch adsorption study was carried out as a function of contact time, adsorbent dose, temperature (303-323 K). The experimental data was analyzed using Freundlich, Langmuir, Dubinin-Radushkevich (D-R) and Redlich-Peterson (R-P) isotherm models. It was found that Freundlich, Langmuir and R-P models fitted well. pH variation study revealed that the adsorption increased with increase in pH of the solution. Maximum loading capacity was found to be 30 mg g(-1) at 20 mg L(-1) of initial Cu concentration. Adsorption data were analyzed using two kinetic models, Lagergren first order and pseudo second order. It was observed that pseudo second order represented the best correlation. Langmuir isotherm was used to obtain the thermodynamic parameters such as free energy (DeltaG degrees ), enthalpy (DeltaH degrees ) and entropy (DeltaS degrees ) of adsorption. The negative value of free energy and positive value of enthalpy change indicate that the adsorption of Cu on newspaper pulp is a spontaneous process and endothermic. The results of activation energy also confirmed that the adsorption of Cu on newspaper pulp is physical in nature.

Chemical fingerprint analysis for quality assessment and control of Bansha herbal tea using paper spray mass spectrometry.,"Jiewei Deng, Yunyun Yang","Chemical fingerprinting methodology is an approach for quality assessment and control of herbal medicines and related products based on the holistic chemical profile obtained by various analytical techniques. This study demonstrates the first application of paper spray mass spectrometry (PS-MS) as a chemical fingerprinting methodology for tracing the origins, establishing the authenticity, and assessing the overall quality of a famous herbal product, Bansha herbal tea (BHT). A negative ion PS-MS spectrum yielded the best chemical profiling information and was most appropriate for fingerprint analysis of BHT. In addition to the identification of active ingredients, various compounds present in BHT were simultaneously detected without any sample pretreatment and chromatographic separation, providing valuable information for the quality assessment and control of this herbal product. According to the principal component analysis of the PS-MS fingerprints, two sources of commercially available BHT products made by different manufacturers were easily differentiated. Qualified and expired products from the two manufacturers were also successfully distinguished, and the consistency of the quality between the manufacturers was assessed.

The detection of NBOMe designer drugs on blotter paper by high resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOFMS) with and without chromatography.,"Sabra Botch-Jones, Jamie Foss, David Barajas, Frank Kero, Craig Young, Jason Weisenseel","New psychoactive substances (NPS) have been associated with fatalities and severe injuries in a number of cases in the United States and have led investigators to rethink traditional drug monitoring protocols. Of particular interest are the variable phenethylamine chemical structures known as 'NBOMes', which pose an emerging threat to public health with incidence steadily growing over the past decade. In this study, direct sample analysis (DSA)-time of flight mass spectrometry was employed to leverage rapid and sensitive ambient ionization mass spectrometry without chromatographic separation as verified with an authentic case sample. Samples for method development were prepared at Boston University School of Medicine's Biomedical Forensic Sciences program (Boston, MA) and analyzed at the State of Maine Health and Environmental Testing Laboratory's Forensic Chemistry Section (Augusta, ME). Preliminary method development work was performed at the University of Central Florida (Orlando, FL). DSA without any extraction step in addition to the evaluation of methanol, dichloromethane and hexane extractions were conducted. Methanol was found to not be a suitable extraction solvent for DSA analysis of these compounds. For the screening of NBOMe designer drug variables on blotter paper, DSA-TOFMS was successful at reducing analysis time to ∼15s per sample, for qualitative identification for the selected analytes of interest.

Vegetal fiber paper matrix impregnated with silica gel for benzene removal.,"Xuannan Wu, Tianshu Ge, Yanjun Dai, Ruzhu Wang","Removing benzene from indoor space plays an important role in indoor air purification. A novel filter with vegetal fiber paper (VFP) as matrix hosting silica gel is proposed in this paper for benzene removal. In order to investigate the feasibility and performance of this idea, firstly, three pieces of VFP samples impregnated with different amounts of silica gel are fabricated and their benzene adsorption quantities are tested. The results show that three times is recommended as the optimal number for impregnating. The VFP sample impregnated with silica gel after the third impregnating exhibits commendable coating stability and good benzene adsorption performance. Additionally, at low relative pressure (P<sub>b</sub> /P<sub>s</sub>  ≤ 0.05), the experimental data of benzene adsorption isotherms fit well with the Langmuir model with R<sup>2</sup> greater than 0.97. Then, two actual filters made of VFP impregnated with silica gel after the third impregnating were fabricated. It is found that the pressure drop of the actual filter is only 1200 Pa/m when the air velocity is 2 m/s. Besides, the one-pass efficiency of the filter can reach to 19.44%.

Aiming for a moving target: challenges with impactor measurements of MDI aerosols.,Stephen W Stein,"Experiments were conducted to illustrate some of the challenges associated with measuring dynamic MDI aerosols. Experimental HFA-134a solution MDIs containing 8 or 20% ethanol were measured using the Andersen cascade impactor using three different inlets. It was demonstrated that the size distribution of MDI aerosols changes substantially during the measurement process. The measured size distribution was shown to be dependent on the degree of evaporation that has occurred prior to size measurement. Additionally, the degree of evaporation prior to measurement also influences the number of modes present in the measured size distribution. While MDI aerosols appeared to have a separate large particle mode when measured using the U.S. Pharmacopeial induction port (""USP inlet""; [U.S. Pharmacopeia, 1996.

Determination of Cr(VI) concentration in diluted samples based on the paper test strip method.,"F Kong, Y Ni","At present, there are many methods for Cr(VI) concentration determination in diluted samples, however, these methods have their own inherent drawbacks, such as long response time, complicated pretreatment, expensive equipment etc. In this paper, a paper-based test strip method specific for determination of diluted Cr(VI) samples was developed. In this method, Aliquat 336, as an anion exchanger was loaded into filter paper to form a test strip. This test strip was used to pre-concentrate Cr(VI) when contacting with the diluted Cr(VI)-containing solution. The Cr(VI)-containing test strip was then immersed into a diphenylcarbazide (DPC) solution (a color forming solution), and the color intensity was correlated to the Cr(VI) concentration. The detection range of the present method was found to be 0.02-1.50 mg/L. The results also showed that the method gave a high selectivity for Cr(VI) in the diluted samples to be tested.

'Learning disabilities' as a 'black box': on the different conceptions and constructions of a popular clinical entity in Israel.,Ofer Katchergin,"This article aims to stimulate new thinking about learning disabilities than is customary in local literature. Previous educational and psychological studies concerning learning disabilities regarded them as if they were objective categories with formal definitions and criteria accepted in scholarly literature. Contrary to that, this article explores the various conceptions, constructions, and meanings of learning disabilities that comprise the narrative descriptions and explanations of didactic diagnosticians. For this purpose, 50 in-depth interviews were conducted. There are four sections. Part One lays out the theoretical and methodological background of the sociological and discursive debate about learning disabilities. Part Two explores the various main thematic aspects and narrative strategies that were used by the diagnosticians in their construction of their purportedly 'objective', 'a-historical', 'a-political' experts' narrative. The third part reveals the polyphonic multifaceted nature of the learning disabilities construct. The experts' narrative undermines the objective and homogeneous definitions in the literature by uncovering learning disabilities' heterogeneous meaning repertoire. This repertoire consists, among others, of conceptualizing disability as a 'disease', a 'symptom', a 'genetic defect', a 'disorder', an 'educational difficulty', a 'variance', and even a 'gift'. This part also reveals the experts' narrative reaction strategies to the aforementioned polyphonic spectacle. It is revealed that the interviewees' narrative deconstructs the 'scientific factual nature' of the clinical categories. The fourth part highlights a central paradox in the expert narrative: The tension between the narrative stigmatic-labeling aspects and the destigmatic-'liberating' aspects. The claim is made that this tension can partly explain the current popularity of the LD diagnosis. This article is the third in a series of papers that seeks to contribute to the creation of a more nuanced disability discourse by exposing its shaky scientific foundations.",,"Culture, Medicine And Psychiatry",no keywords,"concept formation, female, humans, interviews as topic, israel, learning disabilities, male, medicalization, models, theoretical, politics",10.1007/s11013-014-9398-3,"Oranim Academic College, Kiryat Tivon, Israel, oferkerenor@gmail.com."

Using Adhesive Patterning to Construct 3D Paper Microfluidic Devices.,"Brent Kalish, Hideaki Tsutsui","We demonstrate the use of patterned aerosol adhesives to construct both planar and nonplanar 3D paper microfluidic devices. By spraying an aerosol adhesive through a metal stencil, the overall amount of adhesive used in assembling paper microfluidic devices can be significantly reduced. We show on a simple 4-layer planar paper microfluidic device that the optimal adhesive application technique and device construction style depends heavily on desired performance characteristics. By moderately increasing the overall area of a device, it is possible to dramatically decrease the wicking time and increase device success rates while also reducing the amount of adhesive required to keep the device together. Such adhesive application also causes the adhesive to form semi-permanent bonds instead of permanent bonds between paper layers, enabling single-use devices to be non-destructively disassembled after use. Nonplanar 3D origami devices also benefit from the semi-permanent bonds during folding, as it reduces the likelihood that unrelated faces may accidently stick together.

Coupling frontal elution paper chromatography with desorption corona beam ionization mass spectrometry for rapid analysis of chlorphenamine in herbal medicines and dietary supplements.,"Yun-Qing Huang, Jing-Qing You, Junsheng Zhang, Wenjian Sun, Li Ding, Yu-Qi Feng","We developed a convenient method by coupling frontal elution paper chromatography with desorption corona beam ionization mass spectrometry (DCBI-MS) for rapid determination of chlorphenamine added in herbal medicines or dietary supplements. In this method, the ethanol extract of the herbal products was spotted directly onto an isosceles triangular filter paper sheet, and then the paper sheet was developed under strong elution condition with the sample zone migrating at the solvent front. The analyte was finally condensed at the V-shaped tip which could then be placed under the visible plasma beam of DCBI for ionization. The overall procedure took less than 5 min. The frontal elution paper chromatography on a triangular plate used in this work improved the signal intensity of chlorphenamine by 30-fold due to the analyte condensing at the tip and the reduction of the background suppression. Furthermore, the paper sheet also functioned as a filter in the analysis of solid or powder samples, which can increase the analytical throughput by omitting the step of centrifugation. The proposed method in current study was successfully applied in the determination of chlorphenamine in herbal medicines. Chlorphenamine was detected in four of the twelve types of herbal medicines examined in this study. The limit of detection was 200 ng/mL (2.0 ng absolute) in full-scan positive-ion mode and the linear range was from 5.0 μg/mL to 50 μg/mL with satisfactory linear coefficient (R(2) (the square of the correlation coefficient)=0.895).

Compliance spectrum as a drug fingerprint of drug intake and drug disposition.,"Olivier Barrière, Jun Li, Fahima Nekka","Since drug related variability arises from different origins, particularly driven by the behaviour or physiology of the patient, the problems of drug intake and drug disposition are separately presented in general. To overcome the potential drawbacks of this artificial split, we propose in this paper a combined illustrative approach, named compliance spectrum, such that these two subprocesses can be equitably studied and visualized. We construct the compliance spectrum based on the Bayesian decision method we previously developed for the inverse problem of patient compliance within the framework of Population-PK. This spectrum provides an intuitive and interactive way to evaluate the relationship between drug intake and drug disposition along with their consequences on PK profile.

Improved refining properties of pulps pretreated with ionic liquids under mild conditions.,"Zhiqiang Pang, Jiachuan Chen, Cuihua Dong, Guihua Yang, Yu Liu","Imidazolium-based ionic liquids (ILs), including 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (BmimCl) and 1-allyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (AmimCl), were used to improve the refining properties of pulps under mild conditions. Results showed that the macro appearance of pulps was virtually unchanged after pretreatment with ILs under mild conditions. In addition, chemical pulps pretreated with ILs are more suitable for pretreatment than chemimechanical pulps. Pretreatment with ILs facilitates the refining process by destroying hydrogen bonds, which exist extensively in fiber. At the same refining energy input, the Canada standard freeness (CSF) of refined pulp decreased with improved fiber quality. At identical CSF values, the energy consumed during refining significantly decreased because ILs pretreatment facilitated swelling and fibrillation. The viscosity of cellulose changed slightly after IL pretreatment. However, the crystallinity index and fines content decreased, and the micro appearance of the fiber surface changed.

Improvement of high-yield pulp properties by using a small amount of bleached wheat straw pulp.,"Hongjie Zhang, Zhibin He, Yonghao Ni","In this study, the potential of using bleached wheat straw pulp (BWSP) was explored to improve the tensile strength of the high-yield pulp (HYP) while preserving its high bulk property. The results showed that with the addition of 5-10% refined BWSP, the HYP tensile strength can be increased by about 10-20% without sacrificing the bulk. Similar results were obtained by adding refined BWSP into a mixed furnish of bleached kraft pulps (BKPs) and HYP.

Colloids engineering and filtration to enhance the sensitivity of paper-based biosensors.,"Ping Peng, Lauren Summers, Alexandra Rodriguez, Gil Garnier","Paper-based biosensors represent a disruptive technology by providing instantaneous and low-cost diagnostics for health and environmental applications. The lack of sensitivity can be an obstacle for this technology to compete with traditional analytical instrumentations. Aiming to improve the sensitivity of a paper-based colorimetric biosensor, we have applied colloids engineering in combination with filtration to lower the paper substrate backgrounds and optimize the immobilization of bio-molecules on paper. A model system consisting of an enzyme, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and an inorganic colloid, calcium carbonate (CC), flocculated by a cationic dimethylamino-ethyl-methacrylate polyacrylamide (CPAM), demonstrated that the optimized CC flocs are best for enhancing the detecting sensitivity of ALP. The CC floc structure on paper was optimized by modulating its structure in suspension. Subsequently, the filtration process and the wicking ability of paper enabled to freeze the deposited CC structure inherited from the suspension. The incorporation of biomolecules into the CC before immobilizing on paper through filtration provided not only a better microenvironment, but also a higher surface density of immobilized biomolecules. The ALP detection limit of 117 fmol per zone (5mm circle) in the current study was fifty times lower than that of the common soaking method for biomolecule immobilization. The minimum amount of biomolecules per unit substrate area required for detection was lowered by over an order of magnitude, compared with spotting methods (i.e. inkjet printing). The improvement was also demonstrated by the steepest slope of standard curve, the lowest background, and the highest activity of the bioactive paper probed with the diluted BCIP/NBT liquid substrates.",2011-01-01,"Colloids And Surfaces.

Herein, we report on the use of a fluorescent metal-organic framework hydrogel that exhibits a higher detection capability for TNT in the gel state compared with that in the solution state. A portable sensor prepared from filter paper coated by the hydrogel was able to detect TNT at the picogram level with a detection limit of 1.82 ppt (parts per trillon). Our results present a simple and new means to provide selective detection of TNT on a surface or in aqueous solution, as afforded by the unique molecular packing through the metal-organic framework structure in the gel formation and the associated photophysical properties.

Combining a hydrogel and an electrochemical biosensor to determine the extent of degradation of paper artworks.,"Laura Micheli, Claudia Mazzuca, Antonio Palleschi, Giuseppe Palleschi","Paper-based artworks are among the most valuable assets for transmission of knowledge.

In this work, application of a new biotechnological strategy for paper artefact preservation is reported. By making use of innovative and non-invasive materials, for example appropriate hydrogels, in combination with selective electrochemical biosensors, it is possible to simultaneously verify the degradation condition of the paper artwork and then to efficiently clean it, while monitoring the process of removal of both pollution and degradation products.

Shape Matters: A Neglected Feature of Medication Safety : Why Regulating the Shape of Medication Containers Can Improve Medication Safety.,"Yuval Bitan, Mark E Nunnally","This paper aims to highlight how to reduce medication errors through the implementation of human factors science to the design features of medication containers. Despite efforts to employ automation for increased safety and decreased workload, medication administration in hospital wards is still heavily dependent on human operators (pharmacists, nurses, physicians, etc.). Improving this multi-step process requires its being studied and designed as an interface in a complex socio-technical system. Human factors engineering, also known as ergonomics, involves designing socio-technical systems to improve overall system performance, and reduces the risk of system, and in particular, operator, failures. The incorporation of human factors principles into the design of the work environment and tools that are in use during medication administration could improve this process. During periods of high workload, the cognitive effort necessary to work through a very demanding process may overwhelm even expert operators. In such conditions, the entire system should facilitate the human operator's high level of performance. Regarding medications, clinicians should be provided with as many perceptual cues as possible to facilitate medication identification. Neglecting the shape of the container as one of the features that differentiates between classes of medications is a lost opportunity to use a helpful characteristic, and medication administration failures that happen in the absence of such intentional design arise from ""designer error"" rather than ""user error"".

High-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in the identification and determination of phase I and phase II drug metabolites.,"M Holcapek, L Kolárová, M Nobilis","Applications of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) techniques coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in the identification and determination of phase I and phase II drug metabolites are reviewed with an emphasis on recent papers published predominantly within the last 6 years (2002-2007) reporting the employment of atmospheric pressure ionization techniques as the most promising approach for a sensitive detection, positive identification and quantitation of metabolites in complex biological matrices. This review is devoted to in vitro and in vivo drug biotransformation in humans and animals. The first step preceding an HPLC-MS bioanalysis consists in the choice of suitable sample preparation procedures (biomatrix sampling, homogenization, internal standard addition, deproteination, centrifugation, extraction). The subsequent step is the right optimization of chromatographic conditions providing the required separation selectivity, analysis time and also good compatibility with the MS detection. This is usually not accessible without the employment of the parent drug and synthesized or isolated chemical standards of expected phase I and sometimes also phase II metabolites. The incorporation of additional detectors (photodiode-array UV, fluorescence, polarimetric and others) between the HPLC and MS instruments can result in valuable analytical information supplementing MS results. The relation among the structural changes caused by metabolic reactions and corresponding shifts in the retention behavior in reversed-phase systems is discussed as supporting information for identification of the metabolite. The first and basic step in the interpretation of mass spectra is always the molecular weight (MW) determination based on the presence of protonated molecules [M+H](+) and sometimes adducts with ammonium or alkali-metal ions, observed in the positive-ion full-scan mass spectra. The MW determination can be confirmed by the [M-H](-) ion for metabolites providing a signal in negative-ion mass spectra. MS/MS is a worthy tool for further structural characterization because of the occurrence of characteristic fragment ions, either MS( n ) analysis for studying the fragmentation patterns using trap-based analyzers or high mass accuracy measurements for elemental composition determination using time of flight based or Fourier transform mass analyzers. The correlation between typical functional groups found in phase I and phase II drug metabolites and corresponding neutral losses is generalized and illustrated for selected examples. The choice of a suitable ionization technique and polarity mode in relation to the metabolite structure is discussed as well.",2008-01-01,Analytical And Bioanalytical Chemistry,no keywords,"biotransformation, chromatography, high pressure liquid, molecular structure, pharmaceutical preparations, tandem mass spectrometry, xenobiotics",10.1007/s00216-008-1962-7,"Department of Analytical Chemistry, Faculty of Chemical Technology, University of Pardubice, Nám.

Degraders early developability assessment: face-to-face with molecular properties.,"Giuseppe Ermondi, Maura Vallaro, Giulia Caron","Pharmaceutical scientists have huge expectations from heterobifunctional small molecule degraders to treat diseases with an unmet medical need. However, degraders are large and flexible and pose significant challenges in terms of cellular uptake and bioavailability.

"Exploring paediatric oral suspension development: Challenges, requirements, and formulation advancements.","Sachin S Gaikwad, Javier O Morales, Narayan B Lande, Johanna Catalán-Figueroa, Umesh D Laddha, Sanjay J Kshirsagar","Oral suspension is the most preferred dosage form for the paediatric population because of the difficulties related to solid medications, such as the swallowing limitations, bitter taste, and poor oral bioavailability, which can cause serious impairment to attain a successful treatment. Given the importance of successful therapies, there is a need for safe and effective commercially-available paediatric oral suspension and their characterization. For the latter, it is important to identify safe excipients and preservatives. The paediatric group is a diverse category which includes infants and teenagers, with major pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics differences, mainly because of physiological and behavioral variations. Therefore, finding a single formulation for paediatric population remains a challenge, as well asthe formulation of stable-in-time suspension. In addition, drug's dissolving characteristic and permeation, are the main determinants for oral absorption, which are closely related to drug release kinetics from the pharmaceutical form. In this context, drug release profile is an important and limiting step in oral bioavailability, particularly for BCS class II drugs; thus, it is possible to increase bioavailability and minimize adverse effects by changing the release rate of such drugs.

The PRISMA protocol-based review of the most recent literature data from the last 10 years (2011-2021) was reported. Articles were searched by the combination of the following keywords: photobioreactor, pharmaceuticals, drugs, hormones, antibiotics, biodegradation, removal, wastewater treatment. The review focuses on original research papers (not reviews), collected in 3 scientific databases: Scopus, Web of Knowledge, PubMed. The review considered the following factors: type of microorganisms, type of micropollutants removed, degradation efficiency and associated products, types of photosynthetic organisms and photobioreactor types. The conclusion from the systematic review is that the main factors that limit widespread pharmaceuticals removal in photobioreactors are high costs and the problem of low efficiency related with low concentrations of pharmaceuticals. The review indicated a need for further research in this area due to increasing amounts of metabolites in the food chain, such as p-aminophenol and estrone, which can cause harm to people and ichthyofauna. Pharmaceuticals removal can be improved by adapting the type of microorganism used to the type of contamination and implementing photoperiods, which increase the removal efficiency of e.g. sulfamethazine by up to 28%.

Double-injection capillary electrophoresis for the identification of analytes.,Ahmad Amini,"This paper presents a new approach for identifying analytes by CE. The compound to be identified is analyzed together with the corresponding reference standard during a double injection capillary electrophoretic run. The inter-plug distance is regulated by applying an electrical field over the capillary for a predetermined time period (t(PE)). The migration time of an analyte being exposed to the partial electrophoresis was calculated from the partial migration time (t(mig(p))) as described in this paper. The identification is based on the closeness of agreement between the calculated migration time (t(mig(c))) and observed migration time (t(mig)) of the reference standard. The validity of the derived equations was checked by analyzing several substances such as caffeine, melamine, acetyl salicylic acid, paracetamol, ibuprofen, metoprolol, naproxen, somatropin, several insulin analogs, as well as different pharmaceutical and natural products.

Kraft lignin serves as the raw material for synthesizing a blocked waterborne polyurethane, subsequently combined with carboxylated chitosan to form a stable binary emulsion. The resulting emulsion, exhibiting remarkable stability over at least 6 months, is applied to the base paper. Following emulsion application, the paper undergoes torrefaction at 155 °C. This process deblocks isocyanate groups, enabling their reaction with hydroxyl groups on chitosan and fibers, ultimately forming ester bonds. This reaction significantly improves the mechanical strength and hydrophobicity of paper straws. The composite paper straws demonstrate exceptional mechanical properties, including a tensile strength of 47.21 MPa, Young's modulus of 4.33 GPa, and flexural strength of 32.38 MPa. Notably, its water stability is greatly enhanced, with a wet tensile strength of 40.66 MPa, surpassing commercial paper straws by 8 folds.

Herein, an optimized paper-based surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) platform with patterned printing of plasmonic nanoparticles was constructed for the on-site quick testing of illegal drugs in urine. The filter paper was first coated with a layer of positive-charged chitosan, so as to reduce its roughness by filling the holes of the cellulose matrix and enhance the adhesion of negative-charged silver ink. Subsequently, hydrophobic modification was performed based on the binary silylation reaction, which could obviously improve the sensitivity of the paper-based SERS substrate by concentrating the amount of analyte.

Role of liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HR/MS) in clinical toxicology.,"Alan Hb Wu, Roy Gerona, Patil Armenian, Deborah French, Matthew Petrie, Kara L Lynch","Gas chromatography (GC) and liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) are widely used to confirm drug screening results and for urine screening in presumed intoxicated patients. These techniques are better suited to targeted analysis than to general unknown screening and, due to the complexity of testing, results are seldom available rapidly enough to contribute to the immediate care of the patient. High resolution (HR)/MS with time-of-flight (TOF) or orbitrap instruments offer potential advantages in clinical toxicology. COMPARISON OF GC-MS, LC-MS/MS AND LC-HR/MS: For unknown analyses, GC-MS and LC-MS/MS require comparison of full-scan spectra against preestablished libraries. Operation in full-scan mode greatly reduces sensitivity and some drugs present in low but significant concentrations may be missed. Selected ion monitoring (SIM) in GC/MS and selected reaction monitoring (SRM) in LC-MS/MS, where only targeted ions are monitored, increase sensitivity but require prior knowledge of what compound is to be measured. LC-HR/MS offers mass assignment with an accuracy of 0.001 atomic mass units (amu) compared with 1 amu in conventional MS. Tentative identification is thus directed to a very limited set of compounds (or even one unique compound) based on the exact molecular formula rather than a fragmentation pattern, since HR/MS can discriminate between compounds with the same nominal molecular mass. LC-MS/MS has clear advantages over GC/MS in ease and speed of sample preparation and the opportunities for its automation. LC-HR/MS is more suitable to clinical toxicology because the drugs present in a sample are rarely known a priori, and tentative identifications of unknowns can be made without the availability of a reference standard or a library spectrum.

The kit works based on paper microfluidics which offer several advantages over conventional microfluidics, and has great potential to generate inexpensive, easy-to-use, rapid and disposable diagnostic devices. Here, we have developed a colorimetric assay that is specific to artesunate and turns yellow upon addition of the sample. The test can be done within minutes, and allows for a semi-quantitative analysis of the artesunate tablets by comparing the developed yellow color on the paper test to a color-coded key chart that comes with the kit. A more accurate and precise analysis is done by utilizing a color analyzer on an iPhone camera that measures the color intensity of the developed color on the paper chip. A digital image of the chip was taken and analyzed by measuring the average gray intensity of the color developed on the paper circle. A plot of the artesunate concentration versus the average gray scale intensity was generated. Results show that the intensity of the yellow color developed on the paper test was consistent and proportional to the amount of artesunate present in the sample.

Paper-based SERS substrate and one-class classifier to monitor thiabendazole residual levels in extracts of mango peels.,"Carlos A Teixeira, Ronei J Poppi","The assessment of pesticide residue levels demands fast, low cost and easy-to-use procedures which are not found in conventional methods. In this work, SERS substrates based on the deposition of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) on common office paper were prepared using a wax printer. These substrates combined with Data Driven Soft Independent Modelling of Class Analogies (DD-SIMCA), a one-class classifier algorithm, were used for detection of pesticide residues in water extracts of mango peels. Paper-based substrates made sample collection easier compared with conventional SERS methods, since few microliters of the pesticide aqueous extract from fruit peels needed to be deposited onto the substrate. Moreover, one-class classifiers dismiss the need for quantification or calibration curves. Classification of a fruit with residue levels in accordance to regulatory bodies' limits is based on a mathematical threshold. Just as in an authentication problem, all the possibilities for a given analysed fruit are now restricted to agreeing or not agreeing with current regulations. The performance of the one-class model was demonstrated by detecting thiabendazole (TBZ) residues at various mango samples, with all results being confirmed by HPLC-DAD analysis.

Dose Predictions for Drug Design.,"Tristan S Maurer, Dennis Smith, Kevin Beaumont, Li Di","The efficacious dose of a drug is perhaps the most holistic metric reflecting its therapeutic potential. Dose is predicted at many stages in drug discovery and development. Prior to the 1990s, dose prediction was limited to the drug ""working"" at a reasonable dose and dose regimen in an animal model. Through the early 2000s, dose predictions were generated at candidate nomination and then refined during clinical development. Currently, dose predictions can be made early in drug discovery to enable drug design. Dose predictions at this stage can identify critical drug properties for a viable dose regimen and provide clinically relevant context to lead optimization.

Kinetics of drug action in disease states: towards physiology-based pharmacodynamic (PBPD) models.,Meindert Danhof,"Gerhard Levy started his investigations on the ""Kinetics of Drug Action in Disease States"" in the fall of 1980. The objective of his research was to study inter-individual variation in pharmacodynamics. To this end, theoretical concepts and experimental approaches were introduced, which enabled assessment of the changes in pharmacodynamics per se, while excluding or accounting for the cofounding effects of concomitant changes in pharmacokinetics. These concepts were applied in several studies. The results, which were published in 45 papers in the years 1984-1994, showed considerable variation in pharmacodynamics. These initial studies on kinetics of drug action in disease states triggered further experimental research on the relations between pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Together with the concepts in Levy's earlier publications ""Kinetics of Pharmacologic Effects"" (Clin Pharmacol Ther 7(3): 362-372, 1966) and ""Kinetics of pharmacologic effects in man: the anticoagulant action of warfarin"" (Clin Pharmacol Ther 10(1): 22-35, 1969), they form a significant impulse to the development of physiology-based pharmacodynamic (PBPD) modeling as novel discipline in the pharmaceutical sciences. This paper reviews Levy's research on the ""Kinetics of Drug Action in Disease States"". Next it addresses the significance of his research for the evolution of PBPD modeling as a scientific discipline. PBPD models contain specific expressions to characterize in a strictly quantitative manner processes on the causal path between exposure (in terms of concentration at the target site) and the drug effect (in terms of the change in biological function). Pertinent processes on the causal path are: (1) target site distribution, (2) target binding and activation and (3) transduction and homeostatic feedback.",2015-01-01,Journal Of Pharmacokinetics And Pharmacodynamics,"biophase distribution, disease systems analysis, dynamical systems analysis, receptor theory","disease, drug therapy, kinetics, models, biological, models, theoretical, pharmaceutical preparations, pharmacokinetics",10.1007/s10928-015-9437-x,"Leiden Academic Centre for Drug Research, Leiden University, P.O.

Paper-based nucleic acid amplification tests for point-of-care diagnostics.,"Navjot Kaur, Bhushan J Toley","There has been a recent resurgence in the use of paper as a substrate for developing point-of-care medical diagnostic tests, possibly triggered by expiring patents published in the 1990s. A hallmark of this resurgence has been the development of advanced shapes and structures made from paper to conduct multi-step fluidic operations using the wicking action of porous materials. Such devices indicate a distinct improvement over lateral flow immunoassays, which are restricted to conducting one-step operations. New developments in paper-based diagnostic devices have triggered interest in the development of paper-based point-of-care nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). NAATs can identify extremely low levels of specific nucleic acid sequences from clinical samples and are the most sensitive of all available tests for infectious disease diagnosis. Because traditional PCR-based NAATs require expensive instruments, the development of portable paper-based NAAT's has become an exciting field of research. This article aims to review and analyse the current state of development of paper-based NAATs. We project paper-based NAATs as miniaturized chemical processes and shed light on various schemes of operation used for converting the multiple steps of the chemical processes into paper microfluidic devices.

A review of GI conditions critical to oral drug absorption in malnourished children.,"Lisa Freerks, Eleni Papadatou Soulou, Hannah Batchelor, Sandra Klein",Accurate prediction of oral absorption of drugs relies on biorelevant methodology. Current methods are based on Western healthy adult populations. Malnourished children have many differences in their gastrointestinal anatomy and physiology compared to a healthy Western adult. These differences may affect the oral absorption of medicines and it is important to gather knowledge on these GI differences in order to develop biorelevant predictive methods for this vulnerable population. A literature search was conducted within PubMed and Scopus to identify papers that describe how gastrointestinal physiology and anatomy is altered in malnourished children. Relevant data was extracted and a narrative review generated to describe how GI differences may affect oral drug absorption. Several differences in GI anatomy and physiology were reported in the literature including: reduced saliva secretion; increased gastric pH; slower gastric emptying; increased levels of bacteria in the small intestine; reduced surface area of intestinal villi and increased intestinal permeability. Much of the data was more than 30 years old and referred to a heterogeneous malnourished population. Sufficient data has been identified that will inform basic novel biorelevant methods to predict oral drug absorption in malnourished children.

Since then, two MCS papers have been published: the first proposing a structured approach to consider the impact of drug substance physical properties on manufacturability and the second outlining real world examples of MCS principles. By 2023, both publications had been extensively cited by over 240 publications. This article firstly reviews this citing work and considers how the MCS concepts have been received and are being applied. Secondly, we will extend the MCS framework to continuous manufacture. The review structure follows the flow of drug product development focussing first on optimisation of API properties. The exploitation of links between API particle properties and manufacturability using large datasets seems particularly promising. Subsequently, applications of the MCS for formulation design include a detailed look at the impact of percolation threshold, the role of excipients and how other classification systems can be of assistance. The final review section focusses on manufacturing process development, covering the impact of strain rate sensitivity and modelling applications.

"Characterization of the lysergic acid diethylamide analog, 1-(thiophene-2-carbonyl)-N,N-diethyllysergamide (1T-LSD) from a blotter product.","Rie Tanaka, Maiko Kawamura, Sakumi Mizutani, Ruri Kikura-Hanajiri","Recently, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) analogs have appeared worldwide as designer drugs. In this study, we identified a distributed LSD analog from a paper-sheet product. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), liquid chromatography-photodiode array-mass spectrometry (LC-PDA-MS), and liquid chromatography with hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS) were used to analyze the sheet product. The sheet product claimed to contain 1-(1,2-dimethylcyclobutanoyl)-N,N-diethyllysergamide (1D-LSD). However, an unknown compound was detected in the product together with tryptamine and L-tryptophan methyl ester. This compound was isolated from the sheets and identified as 1-(thiophene-2-carbonyl)-N,N-diethyl-6-methyl-9,10-didehydroergoline-8β-carboxamide (1-thiophenoyl LSD; 1-(2-thienoyl)-LSD, 1T-LSD), using <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>13</sup>C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and various two-dimensional NMR techniques. 1T-LSD was shown to have the thiophene-2-carbonyl group at the N<sup>1</sup> position instead of the 1,2-dimethylcyclobutane-carbonyl group as claimed. The amount of 1T-LSD (free base) in three individual unit from one sheet was determined to be 87-100 μg per unit using a proton-specific quantitative NMR (<sup>1</sup>H-qNMR) method. Deacylation of 1T-LSD to LSD was also observed to occur in methanol-d<sub>4</sub> during NMR analysis.

Paper based analytical devices for blood grouping: a comprehensive review.,"Saeed Ebrahimi Fana, Maliheh Paknejad, Mahdi Aminian","The clinical importance of blood group (BG) antigens is related to their ability to induce immune antibodies that can cause hemolysis. Yet, ABO and D (Rh) are still considered to be the key antigens for healthy blood transfusion and secondary antigens are the next priority. Serological typing is the most widely used typing method. Rapid and accurate blood grouping plays an important role in some clinical conditions, rather than conventional techniques. Hence, developing a simple and economical model for rapid blood grouping would facilitate these tests. In recent decades, paper-based microfluidics such as μPADs has gained much interest in wide application areas such as point-of-care diagnostic. In this study, we evaluated μPADs that are performed for blood grouping and its recent progress. A comprehensive literature search was performed using databases including PUBMED, SCOPUS, Web of Science and Google Scholar. Keywords were blood grouping or typing, paper analytical device, rapid test, etc. After investigation of search results, 16 papers from 2010 to 2020 were included. Further information in detail was classified in Table 1. Generally, two principles for blood typing μPADs are introduced. The lateral chromatographic flow method and the vertical flow-through method that detects BG in a visual-based manner. To detect results with acceptable clarity many factors and challenges like paper, blood sample, buffer, Ab and RBC interaction and also μPADs stability need to be considered, which are discussed. In conclusion, the simplicity, stability, cheapness, portability and biocompatibility of μPADs for blood grouping confirming its utility and also they have the capability to robust, universal blood-grouping platform.

A number of additives with varied physicochemical properties have been combined with traditional components of liposomes. These novel modification processes have produced new classes of vesicles with the potential to enhance the treatment of both dermatological disorders and systemic pathologies.

Rapid screening and multicomponent quantifications of active components of oral syrup over-the-counter medications by Raman and UV-visible spectroscopy and multivariate regression analysis.,"Sayo O Fakayode, Brinkley Bolton, Bailey Dassow, Kairy Galvez, Harmeet Chohan","Over-the-counter medications (OTCMs) are frequently recommended as a first-line treatment for common ailments, diseases, and illnesses. Oral liquid dosage forms are advantageous for rapid absorption with no dissolution time and are easier for pediatric and geriatric consumers to swallow. The production of these medicines by pharmaceutical industry makes them readily available to the public. Although the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) provides strict guidelines to drug manufacturers of these products; the risk of counterfeiting is a global issue. This can lead to several adverse effects and health issues. Here, we report a fast screening and quality assurance method using Raman and UV-visible spectroscopy combined with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Partial-Least-Square (PLS) regression of commonly used OTCM oral syrups. PLS regressions of UV-visible absorption spectra were used for multicomponent quantifications of the active component (acetaminophen, guaifenesin, dextromethorphan HBr, and phenylephrine HCl) concentrations of OTMCs in flavored (sugar or sugar-free) oral syrups. Raman and UV-visible spectral responses varied based on the type and concentration of the active component analyzed. PCA of the spectral data provided pattern recognition of the oral syrup OTCM. The developed PLS method demonstrated good linearity with an R<sup>2</sup> > 0.9784 and high sensitivity with a low detection limit of 0.02 mg/mL for acetaminophen and guaifenesin. Moreover, the simultaneous quantification of concentrations of all active components by the described method yielded good accuracies ranging from 88 to 94%. This study provides an example of the benefits of the combined use of Raman and UV-vis spectral profiling, PCA, and PLS regression for the quality analysis of oral syrups OTCM providing multicomponent quantification of active components with no need for sample extraction. The reported method can be easily adapted and scaled for online detection analysis used in the drug manufacturing industry, both in-situ and field analysis, and for the quality control of syrups OTCM by regulatory agencies and quality control officers.",2023-01-01,"Spectrochimica Acta.

Research on prediction of human oral bioavailability of drugs based on improved deep forest.,"Lei Ma, Yukun Yan, Shaoxing Dai, Dangguo Shao, Sanli Yi, Jiawei Wang, Jingtao Li, Jiangkai Yan","Human oral bioavailability is a crucial factor in drug discovery. In recent years, researchers have constructed a variety of different prediction models. However, given the limited size of human oral bioavailability data sets, the challenge of making accurate predictions with small sample sizes has become a critical issue in the field. The deep forest model, with its adaptively determinable number of cascade levels, can perform exceptionally well even on small-scale data. However, the original deep forest suffers unbalanced multi-grained scanning process and premature stopping of cascade forest training. In this paper, we propose a human oral bioavailability predict method based on an improved deep forest, called balanced multi-grained scanning mapping cascade forest (bgmc-forest). Firstly, the mordred descriptor method is selected to feature extraction, then enhanced features are obtained by the improved balanced multi-grained scanning, which solves the problem of missing features at both ends. And finally, the prediction results are obtained by feature mapping cascaded forests, which is based on principal component analysis and cascade forests, ensures the effectiveness of the cascade forest. The superiority of the model constructed in this paper is demonstrated through comparative experiments, while the effectiveness of the improved module is verified through ablation experiments.

The acceptor phase can be organic, providing a two-phase extraction system compatible with capillary gas chromatography, or the acceptor phase can be aqueous resulting in a three-phase system compatible with high-performance liquid chromatography or capillary electrophoresis. Due to high enrichment, efficient sample clean-up, and the low consumption of organic solvent, substantial interest has been devoted to LPME in recent years.

In situ gelling systems for ocular drug delivery.,"Bakr Ahmed, Srishty Jaiswal, Srishti Naryal, Rohan M Shah, Raid G Alany, Indu Pal Kaur","In situ gelling systems represent a burgeoning paradigm in ocular drug administration, addressing intrinsic challenges posed by extant ocular formulations, such as compromised bioavailability and constraints in traversing the corneal barrier. This systematic review endeavours to comprehensively examine the contemporary landscape of research in this domain, focusing on the nuanced capabilities of in situ gelling systems to optimize drug delivery and enhance therapeutic outcomes, without much technological complexity. Employing a meticulous search strategy across diverse databases for publications and patents spanning the years 2015 to 2023 a total of 26 research papers and 14 patents meeting stringent inclusion criteria were identified. Synthesizing the collective insights derived from these investigations, it becomes evident that in situ gelling systems confer an ability to protract the residence time of formulations or active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) within the ocular milieu. This sustained presence engenders extended drug release kinetics, thereby fostering improved patient compliance and mitigating the proclivity for side effects attendant to frequent dosing. These salutary effects extend to diminished systemic drug absorption, augmented ocular bioavailability, and the prospect of reduced dosing frequencies, thereby amplifying patient adherence to therapeutic regimens. Intriguingly, the protective attributes of in situ gelling systems extend to the establishment of an ocular surface barrier, thereby abating the susceptibility to infections and inflammatory responses.

Effect of diabetes mellitus on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of drugs.,"Miroslav Dostalek, Fatemeh Akhlaghi, Martina Puzanovova","The effects of diabetes mellitus on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs have been well described in experimental animal models; however, only minimal data exist for humans and the current knowledge regarding the effects of diabetes on these properties remains unclear. Nevertheless, it has been observed that the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs are changed in subjects with diabetes. It has been reported that diabetes may affect the pharmacokinetics of various drugs by affecting (i) absorption, due to changes in subcutaneous adipose blood flow, muscle blood flow and gastric emptying; (ii) distribution, due to non-enzymatic glycation of albumin; (iii) biotransformation, due to regulation of enzymes/transporters involved in drug biotransformation; and (iv) excretion, due to nephropathy. Previously published data also suggest that diabetes-mediated changes in the pharmacokinetics of a particular drug cannot be translated to others. Although clinical studies exploring the effect of diabetes on pharmacodynamics are still very limited, there is evidence that disease-mediated effects are not limited only to pharmacokinetics but also alter pharmacodynamics. However, for many drugs it remains unclear whether these influences reflect diabetes-mediated changes in pharmacokinetics rather than pharmacodynamics. In addition, even though diabetes-mediated pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics might be anticipated, it is important to study the effect on each drug and not generalize from observed data. The available data indicate that there is a significant variability in drug response in diabetic subjects. The discrepancies between individual clinical studies as well as between ex vivo and clinical studies are probably due to (i) the restricted and focused population of subjects in clinical studies; (ii) failure to consider type, severity and duration of the disease; (iii) histopathological characteristics generally being missing; and (iv) other factors such as varying medication use, dietary protein intake, age, sex and obesity. The obesity epidemic in the developed world has also inadvertently influenced the directions of pharmacological research. This review attempts to map new information gained since Gwilt published his paper in Clinical Pharmacokinetics in 1991. Although a large body of research has been conducted and significant progress has been made, we still have to conclude that the available information regarding the effect of diabetes on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics remains unclear and further clinical studies are required before we can understand the clinical significance of the effect. An understanding of diabetes-mediated changes as well as of the source of the variability should lead to the improvement of the medical management and clinical outcomes in patients with this widespread disease.",,Clinical Pharmacokinetics,no keywords,"animals, clinical trials as topic, diabetes mellitus, diabetes mellitus, experimental, humans, pharmaceutical preparations, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology",10.2165/11631900-000000000-00000,"Department of Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Rhode Island, Kingston, RI, USA."
High-capacity conductive nanocellulose paper sheets for electrochemically controlled extraction of DNA oligomers.,"Aamir Razaq, Gustav Nyström, Maria Strømme, Albert Mihranyan, Leif Nyholm","Highly porous polypyrrole (PPy)-nanocellulose paper sheets have been evaluated as inexpensive and disposable electrochemically controlled three-dimensional solid phase extraction materials. The composites, which had a total anion exchange capacity of about 1.1 mol kg(-1), were used for extraction and subsequent release of negatively charged fluorophore tagged DNA oligomers via galvanostatic oxidation and reduction of a 30-50 nm conformal PPy layer on the cellulose substrate. The ion exchange capacity, which was, at least, two orders of magnitude higher than those previously reached in electrochemically controlled extraction, originated from the high surface area (i.e. 80 m(2) g(-1)) of the porous composites and the thin PPy layer which ensured excellent access to the ion exchange material. This enabled the extractions to be carried out faster and with better control of the PPy charge than with previously employed approaches. Experiments in equimolar mixtures of (dT)(6), (dT)(20), and (dT)(40) DNA oligomers showed that all oligomers could be extracted, and that the smallest oligomer was preferentially released with an efficiency of up to 40% during the reduction of the PPy layer.

A review on protein functionalized carbon nanotubes.,"Kathyayini Nagaraju, Roopa Reddy, Narendra Reddy","Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been widely recognized and used for controlled drug delivery and in various other fields due to their unique properties and distinct advantages. Both single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and multiwalled (MWCNTs) carbon nanotubes are used and/or studied for potential applications in medical, energy, textile, composite, and other areas. Since CNTs are chemically inert and are insoluble in water or other organic solvents, they are functionalized or modified to carry payloads or interact with biological molecules.

"Growth hormone, enhancement and the pharmaceuticalisation of short stature.",Michael Morrison,"This paper takes the biological drug human Growth Hormone (hGH) as a case study to investigate processes of pharmaceuticalisation and medicalisation in configuring childhood short stature as a site for pharmaceutical intervention. Human growth hormone is considered to have legitimate applications in treating childhood growth hormone deficiency and short stature associated with other recognised conditions. It is also regarded by bioethicists and others as a form of human biomedical enhancement when applied to children with idiopathic or 'normal' short stature. The purpose of this study is not to evaluate whether treatment of idiopathic short stature is enhancement or not, but to evaluate how some applications of hGH in treating short stature have come to be accepted and stabilised as legitimate 'therapies' while others remain contested as 'enhancements'. A comparative, historical approach is employed, drawing on approaches from medical sociology and Science and Technology Studies (STS) to set out a socio-technical history of hGH in the US and UK. Through this history the relative influence and interplay of drivers of pharmaceuticalisation, including industry marketing and networks of drug distribution, and processes of medicalisation will be employed to address this question and simultaneously query the value of enhancement as a sociological concept.",2014-01-01,Social Science & Medicine (1982),"growth hormone, history, human enhancement, medicalisation, pharmaceuticalisation, sts, uk, usa","biomedical enhancement, body height, dwarfism, pituitary, growth disorders, human growth hormone, humans, medicalization, prescription drug overuse, quality of life, united kingdom, united states",10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.10.015,"Centre for Health, Law & Emerging Technologies (HeLEX), Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Room 120, Rosemary Rue Building, Old Road Campus, Headington, OX3 7LF Oxford, Oxon, UK.

Establishing conditions for the storage and elution of rabies virus RNA using FTA(®) cards.,"Takeo Sakai, Ayako Ishii, Takao Segawa, Yukihiko Takagi, Yuki Kobayashi, Takuya Itou","The Flinders Technology Associates filter paper cards (FTA(®) cards) can be used to store nucleic acid from various samples and are easily portable. However, RNA is physicochemically unstable compared with DNA, and appropriate methods have not been established for storage and extraction of RNA from FTA(®) cards. The present study investigated the optimum conditions for storage and elution of viral RNA (vRNA) using rabies virus (RABV) applied to FTA(®) cards. When TE buffer was used, the elution rates of vRNA increased with the length of the elution time. When the cards were stored at -80 °C or -20 °C, vRNA was stable over 3 months. Degradation of vRNAs occurred following storage at 4 °C and room temperature, suggesting that RNA should be extracted from cards as soon as possible if no freezer is available. When we tried to amplify vRNA from RABV-infected animal brains applied to FTA(®) cards and stored at -80 °C for 6 months, we did not detect any amplified products with the primer set for 964 bp of RABV N gene. However, we were able to detect amplified products by increasing the elution time of vRNA from FTA(®) cards from 30 min to 24 hr or by changing the primer sets to amplify 290 bp of N gene. Thus, we recommend extending the elution time for damaged or low concentration samples in FTA(®) cards.",2014-01-01,The Journal Of Veterinary Medical Science,no keywords,"animals, brain, emulsions, mice, paper, rna, viral, rabies virus, specimen handling, temperature",10.1292/jvms.14-0227,"Nihon University Veterinary Research Center, 1866 Kameino, Fujisawa, Kanagawa 252-0880, Japan."
Navigating the complexities of medicating paediatric patients: Insights from an enteral feeding tube workshop.,"Jennifer Walsh, Esmerald Hermans, Smita Salunke","Enteral feeding tubes (EFT) are used to administer nutrition into the gastrointestinal tract of patients who are unable to take nutrition via mouth. A wide range of children may require enteral feeding through EFT which are also used to administer medication. However, many medicines are not licensed for administration via this route. Numerous factors can impact EFT medicine administration, including for example, dosage form properties and composition, EFT size, design and material, and operational aspects such as tube flushing. As a result, the risk of sub-optimal dosing and medication error is much higher in patients with EFT compared to those without. EuPFI organised a preconference workshop to review the current state of knowledge around aspects to be considered in the verification of EFT administration of medications to children, and considerations for EFT use, and to highlight the areas that remain challenging.

Non-invasive identification of incoming raw pharmaceutical materials using Spatially Offset Raman Spectroscopy.,"Matthew Bloomfield, Darren Andrews, Paul Loeffen, Craig Tombling, Tim York, Pavel Matousek","A new approach to verification of incoming raw materials through packaging in pharmaceutical manufacturing is proposed and demonstrated. The method is based around Spatially Offset Raman Spectroscopy (SORS) and permits a rapid chemical identity analysis of incoming materials to satisfy regulatory requirements but without the need to open the packaging. This dramatically increases the throughput of incoming raw materials into the pharmaceutical manufacturing chain and eliminates the need for a chemically safe sampling environment required for invasive inspection methods. Since the inspection is non-invasive the safety of the operators is ensured and the integrity of inspected material is not compromised by preventing exposure to the ambient atmosphere and cross contamination. The experiments presented here demonstrate the ability to accurately identify common pharmaceutical materials, typically in under 10s acquisition time, through a range of frequently used packaging, including translucent plastic and paper sacks and coloured glass bottles, which can be challenging for conventional Raman spectroscopy as well as other optical spectroscopy methods. With the exception of metallic containers and cardboard drums all the tested packaging materials proved to be amenable to this technique.

To obtain accurate semi-quantitative or quantitative results, μPADs need to respond to the challenges posed by differences in reaction conditions. In this paper, multi-layer μPADs are fabricated by the imprinting method for the colorimetric detection of C-reactive protein (CRP). Different lighting conditions and shooting angles of scenes are simulated in image acquisition, and the detection-related performance of μPADs is improved by using a machine learning algorithm. The You Only Look Once (YOLO) model is used to identify the areas of reaction in μPADs. This model can observe an image only once to predict the objects present in it and their locations. The YOLO model trained in this study was able to identify all the reaction areas quickly without incurring any error. These reaction areas were categorized by classification algorithms to determine the risk level of CRP concentration.

Drug target residence time: a misleading concept.,Rutger H A Folmer,"Since the importance of drug target residence time was first highlighted more 10 years ago, slow binding kinetics has received much attention in the drug discovery literature, and indeed within pharmaceutical research. However, the residence concept as presented in most papers is supported by rather misleading simulations and arguments, and by examples where compounds are taken out of their pharmacokinetic context. Moreover, fast association is typically more desirable than slow, and advantages of long residence time, notably a potential disconnect between pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacokinetics (PK), would be partially or completely offset by slow on-rate. Therefore, plain potency is likely a better predictor of drug development success than is residence time.",2017-01-01,Drug Discovery Today,no keywords,"animals, drug discovery, kinetics, ligands, models, biological, pharmaceutical preparations, pharmacokinetics",10.1016/j.drudis.2017.07.016,"Discovery Sciences, Innovative Medicines and Early Development Biotech Unit, AstraZeneca, Pepparedsleden 1, Mölndal, 431 83, Sweden.

Improving properties of Hanji by coating chitosan-silver nanoparticle solution.,"Jeyoung Jung, Gownolla Malegowd Raghavendra, Dowan Kim, Jongchul Seo","A chitosan-silver nanoparticle solution (CSNS) was applied as a coating material to Hanji (Korean traditional paper), and the properties of the coated paper were investigated as a function of the dilution ratio. The required CSNS was first prepared from AgNO<sub>3</sub> (30mmol) by utilizing chitosan as a reducing and stabilizing agent via ultrasonication. The as-prepared CSNS was diluted to various ratios (undiluted, 1/10, 1/100, and 1/1000) and applied to Hanji by a dip-coating method. The tensile, burst, oil resistance, and antibacterial properties of the coated Hanji against Escherichia coli were evaluated. Among the various dilution ratios, the maximum level of dilution that can positively influence the tensile, burst, oil resistance, and antibacterial properties of Hanji was identified as 1/10, 1/100, 1/10 and 1/1000 of the pure CSNS, respectively.

The read-across hypothesis and environmental risk assessment of pharmaceuticals.,"Mariann Rand-Weaver, Luigi Margiotta-Casaluci, Alpa Patel, Grace H Panter, Stewart F Owen, John P Sumpter","Pharmaceuticals in the environment have received increased attention over the past decade, as they are ubiquitous in rivers and waterways. Concentrations are in sub-ng to low μg/L, well below acute toxic levels, but there are uncertainties regarding the effects of chronic exposures and there is a need to prioritise which pharmaceuticals may be of concern. The read-across hypothesis stipulates that a drug will have an effect in non-target organisms only if the molecular targets such as receptors and enzymes have been conserved, resulting in a (specific) pharmacological effect only if plasma concentrations are similar to human therapeutic concentrations. If this holds true for different classes of pharmaceuticals, it should be possible to predict the potential environmental impact from information obtained during the drug development process. This paper critically reviews the evidence for read-across, and finds that few studies include plasma concentrations and mode of action based effects. Thus, despite a large number of apparently relevant papers and a general acceptance of the hypothesis, there is an absence of documented evidence. There is a need for large-scale studies to generate robust data for testing the read-across hypothesis and developing predictive models, the only feasible approach to protecting the environment.",2013-01-01,Environmental Science & Technology,no keywords,"animals, ecological and environmental phenomena, humans, models, theoretical, pharmaceutical preparations, risk assessment",10.1021/es402065a,"Biosciences, School of Health Sciences and Social Care, Brunel University , Uxbridge, Middlesex, UB8 3PH, United Kingdom."

On-Site Ultrasensitive Detection Paper for Multiclass Chemical Contaminants via Universal Bridge-Antibody Labeling: Mycotoxin and Illegal Additives in Milk as an Example.,"Guanghua Li, Lin Xu, Wenqin Wu, Du Wang, Jun Jiang, Xiaomei Chen, Wen Zhang, Saranya Poapolathep, Amnart Poapolathep, Zhaowei Zhang, Qi Zhang, Peiwu Li","Multiclass chemical contamination of food has aroused ever-increasing attention due to the increasingly common findings of the co-occurrence of multiclass contamination, such as mycotoxin (aflatoxin M1, AFM1) and illegal additive (melamine, MEL). In the present study, a rapid, ultrasensitive detection paper was developed on the basis of a unique bridge-antibody label to realize on-site simultaneous detection of AFM1 and MEL in milk. This detection paper used the bridge-antibody label on fluorescent particles (i.e., the fluorescent Eu nanoparticles were first conjugated with polyclonal antibodies and then with monoclonal antibodies). Dramatically enhanced sensitivity was found, probably due to the increase in immobilization of efficient monoclonal antibodies onto microspheres. Under optimal conditions, the lower limits of detection were 0.009 and 0.024 ng/mL for AFM1 and MEL in milk, respectively, in comparison with similar works. Moreover, the cutoff values were 0.4 and 150 ng/mL for AFM1 and MEL, respectively. The recoveries ranged from 88.7% to 105.0% for AFM1 and from 84.6% to 117.7% for MEL, with relative standard deviations (RSDs) of 0.5-9.9% during the intraday and interday experiments.

"Wood-Derived Materials for Green Electronics, Biological Devices, and Energy Applications.","Hongli Zhu, Wei Luo, Peter N Ciesielski, Zhiqiang Fang, J Y Zhu, Gunnar Henriksson, Michael E Himmel, Liangbing Hu","With the arising of global climate change and resource shortage, in recent years, increased attention has been paid to environmentally friendly materials. Trees are sustainable and renewable materials, which give us shelter and oxygen and remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Trees are a primary resource that human society depends upon every day, for example, homes, heating, furniture, and aircraft. Wood from trees gives us paper, cardboard, and medical supplies, thus impacting our homes, school, work, and play. All of the above-mentioned applications have been well developed over the past thousands of years. However, trees and wood have much more to offer us as advanced materials, impacting emerging high-tech fields, such as bioengineering, flexible electronics, and clean energy. Wood naturally has a hierarchical structure, composed of well-oriented microfibers and tracheids for water, ion, and oxygen transportation during metabolism. At higher magnification, the walls of fiber cells have an interesting morphology-a distinctly mesoporous structure. Moreover, the walls of fiber cells are composed of thousands of fibers (or macrofibrils) oriented in a similar angle. Nanofibrils and nanocrystals can be further liberated from macrofibrils by mechanical, chemical, and enzymatic methods. The obtained nanocellulose has unique optical, mechanical, and barrier properties and is an excellent candidate for chemical modification and reconfiguration. Wood is naturally a composite material, comprised of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Wood is sustainable, earth abundant, strong, biodegradable, biocompatible, and chemically accessible for modification; more importantly, multiscale natural fibers from wood have unique optical properties applicable to different kinds of optoelectronics and photonic devices. Today, the materials derived from wood are ready to be explored for applications in new technology areas, such as electronics, biomedical devices, and energy. The goal of this study is to review the fundamental structures and chemistries of wood and wood-derived materials, which are essential for a wide range of existing and new enabling technologies. The scope of the review covers multiscale materials and assemblies of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin as well as other biomaterials derived from wood, in regard to their major emerging applications. Structure-properties-application relationships will be investigated in detail. Understanding the fundamental properties of these structures is crucial for designing and manufacturing products for emerging applications. Today, a more holistic understanding of the interplay between the structure, chemistry, and performance of wood and wood-derived materials is advancing historical applications of these materials. This new level of understanding also enables a myriad of new and exciting applications, which motivate this review. There are excellent reviews already on the classical topic of woody materials, and some recent reviews also cover new understanding of these materials as well as potential applications.

The number of studies conducted to characterize pharmaceutical disposal practices is limited, particularly in the Middle East. Objective The aim of this cross-sectional study was to examine the behaviour of individuals with respect to the disposal of expired and unused medications. Furthermore, we aimed to identify the best methods of education regarding appropriate, safe disposal of medication. Setting The study was carried out in King Khalid University Hospital (KKUH), and King Saud University (KSU), during a 3-month period from February 2015 to April 2015. Method Twelve hundred patients were randomly selected from KKUH and KSU. Participants were invited to complete paper-based questionnaire with self enumeration. Pilot testing was conducted and involved 50 randomly selected participants. Main outcome measures The proportion of expired medications present in the home and their therapeutic groups, disposal methods of expired and unused medications, and preferred educational methods regarding safe and proper disposing of medications. Results A substantial proportion (79.15 %) of respondents disposed of unwanted medication via household waste, while a small proportion (1.70 %) returned unwanted medication to a pharmacy. Although currently practised disposal methods are undoubtedly unsuitable, 70.20 % of respondents considered finding appropriate, safe methods via which to dispose of unwanted medication their responsibility, and 78.6 % expressed an interest in receiving information concerning the correct disposal of unwanted medication. Conclusion We have demonstrated that a low percentage of respondents have ever received information regarding correct medication disposal. Moreover, the results have shown that over half of the respondents store antibiotics in their households. Additionally, respondents weren't aware of the consequences of keeping expired medication at home.

Container-content interactions with radiopharmaceuticals: Seeing is believing.,"Typhanie Ladrière, Laura Aussage, Jonathan Vigne","This perspective article addresses the critical issue of container-content interactions in the administration of intravenous medications, with a focus on radiopharmaceuticals used in nuclear medicine. Medication administration errors pose a significant challenge to patient safety. The ""five rights"" framework-ensuring the right patient, drug, time, dose, and route-serves as a cornerstone for safe drug administration. In the context of radiopharmaceuticals, notable for their use in nuclear medicine, adherence to these principles is paramount due to their unique properties and role in diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. The article explores the impact of container materials, particularly in syringes, on radiopharmaceutical stability and administration accuracy. It delves into the complexities of sorption phenomena, highlighting studies demonstrating its occurrence and potential consequences, including variations in administered doses and compromised diagnostic or therapeutic outcomes. Noteworthy factors influencing sorption include the type of radiopharmaceutical, container composition, molecular properties, and dilution. Findings revealing residual activity in syringes and identifying specific components, such as lubricants, silicon gaskets, and plungers, contributing to adsorption are presented. Migration of metal contaminants from container to content is discussed, emphasizing the potential impact on radiochemical yield and stability. There is a need for comprehensive studies to characterize drug-container interactions and poses crucial questions about the true benefit patients derive from prescribed activities. It challenges current practices, suggesting a need for tailored activity levels, container validation protocols, and rigorous testing of hospital preparations.

"Future supply chains enabled by continuous processing--opportunities and challenges. May 20-21, 2014 Continuous Manufacturing Symposium.","Jagjit Singh Srai, Clive Badman, Markus Krumme, Mauricio Futran, Craig Johnston","This paper examines the opportunities and challenges facing the pharmaceutical industry in moving to a primarily ""continuous processing""-based supply chain. The current predominantly ""large batch"" and centralized manufacturing system designed for the ""blockbuster"" drug has driven a slow-paced, inventory heavy operating model that is increasingly regarded as inflexible and unsustainable. Indeed, new markets and the rapidly evolving technology landscape will drive more product variety, shorter product life-cycles, and smaller drug volumes, which will exacerbate an already unsustainable economic model. Future supply chains will be required to enhance affordability and availability for patients and healthcare providers alike despite the increased product complexity. In this more challenging supply scenario, we examine the potential for a more pull driven, near real-time demand-based supply chain, utilizing continuous processing where appropriate as a key element of a more ""flow-through"" operating model. In this discussion paper on future supply chain models underpinned by developments in the continuous manufacture of pharmaceuticals, we have set out; The significant opportunities to moving to a supply chain flow-through operating model, with substantial opportunities in inventory reduction, lead-time to patient, and radically different product assurance/stability regimes. Scenarios for decentralized production models producing a greater variety of products with enhanced volume flexibility. Production, supply, and value chain footprints that are radically different from today's monolithic and centralized batch manufacturing operations. Clinical trial and drug product development cost savings that support more rapid scale-up and market entry models with early involvement of SC designers within New Product Development. The major supply chain and industrial transformational challenges that need to be addressed. The paper recognizes that although current batch operational performance in pharma is far from optimal and not necessarily an appropriate end-state benchmark for batch technology, the adoption of continuous supply chain operating models underpinned by continuous production processing, as full or hybrid solutions in selected product supply chains, can support industry transformations to deliver right-first-time quality at substantially lower inventory profiles.",2015-01-01,Journal Of Pharmaceutical Sciences,"bioavailability, biopharmaceuticals characterization, chemical stability, controlled delivery, controlled release, polymorphism, processing, tableting","animals, biological availability, cost savings, cost-benefit analysis, delayed-action preparations, drug costs, drug industry, drug stability, humans, pharmaceutical preparations, quality control, solubility, tablets, technology, pharmaceutical, workflow",10.1002/jps.24343,"Department of Engineering, Institute for Manufacturing, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom."

Recent advances in predicting skin permeability of hydrophilic solutes.,"Longjian Chen, Lujia Han, Guoping Lian","Understanding the permeation of hydrophilic molecules is of relevance to many applications including transdermal drug delivery, skin care as well as risk assessment of occupational, environmental, or consumer exposure. This paper reviews recent advances in modeling skin permeability of hydrophilic solutes, including quantitative structure-permeability relationships (QSPR) and mechanistic models. A dataset of measured human skin permeability of hydrophilic and low hydrophobic solutes has been compiled. Generally statistically derived QSPR models under-estimate skin permeability of hydrophilic solutes. On the other hand, including additional aqueous pathway is necessary for mechanistic models to improve the prediction of skin permeability of hydrophilic solutes, especially for highly hydrophilic solutes. A consensus yet has to be reached as to how the aqueous pathway should be modeled. Nevertheless it is shown that the contribution of aqueous pathway can constitute to more than 95% of the overall skin permeability.

Bioequivalence requirements in the European Union: critical discussion.,"Alfredo García-Arieta, John Gordon","The aim of the present paper is to summarize the revised European Union (EU) Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence and to discuss critically with respect to previous European requirements and present US Food and Drug Administration guidelines its more relevant novelties such as the following: in order to facilitate the development of generic medicinal products, the EU guideline includes the eligibility for Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS)-based biowaivers not only for BCS class I drugs but also for class III drugs with tighter requirements for dissolution and excipient composition. The permeability criterion of BCS classification has been substituted with human absorbability, as per the Biopharmaceutical Drug Disposition Classification System. The widening of the acceptance range for C (max) is possible only for highly variable reference products with an additional clinical justification. This scaled widening is carried out with a proportionality constant of 0.760 which is more conservative than the FDA approach and maintains the consumer risk at a 5% level when the intra-subject CV is close to 30%, due to the smooth transition between the scaled and the constant criteria. The guideline allows for the possibility of two-stage designs to obtain the necessary information on formulation differences and variability from interim analyses as a part of the pivotal bioequivalence study, instead of undertaking pilot studies.

The trip of a drug inside the body: From a lipid-based nanocarrier to a target cell.,"Manouchehr Teymouri, Mohammad Mashreghi, Ehsan Saburi, Ali Hejazi, Amin Reza Nikpoor","To date, enormous investigations have been conducted to enhance medicines' target-oriented delivery to improve their therapeutic index. In this regard, lipid-based carrier system might have been regarded as prime delivery systems that are very close to the naturally cell-derived vesicles used for biomolecular communication among cells from occasionally remote tissues. Upon examination of the literature, we found a chasm between groups of investigations in drug pharmaceutics and thought that maybe holistic research could provide better information with respect to drug delivery inside the body, especially when they are going to be injected directly into the bloodstream for systemic distribution. While a collection of older research in most cases dealt with the determination of drug partition coefficient between the aqueous and cell membrane compartments, the link has been overlooked in newer investigations that were mostly focused on drug formulation optimization and their association with particle biodistribution. This gap in the literature motivated us to present the current opinion paper, in which drug physicochemical properties like drug lipophilicity/hydrophilicity is considered as an important element in designing drug-carrying liposomes or micelles. How a hypothetical high throughput cell-embedded chromatographic technique might help to investigate a nanocarrier tissue distribution and to design 'multi-epitope grafted lipid-based drug carrier systems' are discussed. Whenever we would need support for our opinions, we have provided analogy from hydrophobic biomolecules like cholesterol, steroid hormones, and sex hormones and encouraged readers to consider our principle hypothesis: If these molecules could reach their targets far away from the site of production, then a large list of hydrophobic drugs could be delivered to their targets using the same principles.",2019-01-01,Journal Of Controlled Release : Official Journal Of The Controlled Release Society,"drug partition coefficient, lipid-based particles, multi-epitope drug delivery system, protein corona, protein-protein interaction","animals, drug carriers, drug delivery systems, humans, lipid metabolism, lipids, liposomes, nanocapsules, pharmaceutical preparations, tissue distribution",10.1016/j.jconrel.2019.07.027,"Natural Products and Medicinal Plants Research Center, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran., Nanotechnology Research Center, Bu-Ali Research Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences Mashhad, Iran., Immunogenetic and Cell Culture Department, Immunology Research Center, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran., Department of Community Medicine, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran., Molecular Medicine Research Center, Hormozgan Health Institute, Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences, Bandar Abbas, Iran.

Formulation approaches in mitigating toxicity of orally administrated drugs.,"Irina Kadiyala, Elijah Tan","This paper provides an overview of current formulation approaches to mitigate toxicity of orally administrated drugs. The formulation approaches are characterized by their intended impact on a drug's pharmacokinetic parameters, pharmacological properties or metabolic pathways. Regulatory opportunities and constraints with focus on U.S. regulations in optimizing a drug's safety or efficacy profile are reviewed. The following formulation approaches are described: (i) pharmacokinetic-modulating and (ii) pharmacodynamic-modulating. In the pharmacokinetic-modulating approach, the pharmacokinetic profile of drug release is modified by, for example, a reduction in peak drug plasma concentration while preserving or improving AUC, thereby potentially reducing toxic effects that may be related to C(max). In the pharmacodynamic-modulating approach, the drug is co-dosed with pharmacologically active or nonpharmacologically active agent or agents intended for mitigation of the drug's toxicity. The pharmacodynamic-modulating approach requires information on the specificity of drug interactions with other compounds and also on metabolic pathways. Examples demonstrating successful formulation work in reducing drug toxicity are provided.

The unequal trade between developed and developing countries (ie, exporting and importing high-value patented drugs, respectively) raises the issue of access to medicines, which is exacerbated by TRIPS-plus provisions, although many countries have not even enacted provision for TRIPS flexibilities. Therefore this paper focuses on options that are available to the health community for negotiation to their advantage under TRIPS, and within the presence of TRIPS-plus.",2009-01-01,"Lancet (London, England)",no keywords,"commerce, developing countries, drug industry, humans, intellectual property, international cooperation, malaysia, pharmaceutical preparations, world health organization",10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61779-1,"Health Policy Unit, Department of Public Health and Policy, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK."

An interesting relationship between drug absorption and melting point.,"Katherine A Chu, Samuel H Yalkowsky","The ability to predict the extent of passive intestinal drug absorption is very important for efficient lead candidate selection and development. Physicochemical-based absorption predictive models previously developed use solubility, partition coefficient and pK(a) as drug input parameters for intestinal absorption. Alternatively, this study looks at the relationship between melting point and passive transport for poorly soluble drugs. It is based entirely on the expression derived from the General Solubility Equation (GSE) that relates melting point to the product of intrinsic solubility and partition coefficient. Given that the melting point of a compound is one of the first and more reliable physical properties measured, it can be advantageously used as a guide in early drug discovery and development. This paper elucidates the interesting relationship between the melting point and dose to the fraction absorbed of poorly soluble drugs, i.e., class II and IV compounds in the Biopharmaceutics Classification System. The newly defined melting point based absorption potential (MPbAP) parameter is successful at distinguishing 90% of the 91 drugs considered being well absorbed (FA>0.5) or poorly absorbed. In general, lower melting compounds are more likely to be well absorbed than higher melting compounds for any given dose. The fraction absorbed for drugs with high melting temperatures is limited by the dose to a greater degree than it is for low melting compounds.",2009-01-01,International Journal Of Pharmaceutics,no keywords,"algorithms, biological availability, humans, intestinal absorption, models, biological, molecular structure, pharmaceutical preparations, pharmacokinetics, solubility, transition temperature",10.1016/j.ijpharm.2009.01.026,"University of Arizona, College of Pharmacy, 1703 E Mabel Street, Tucson, AZ 85721, USA. chu@pharmacy.arizona.edu"

Analysis of low active-pharmaceutical-ingredient signal drugs based on thin layer chromatography and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy.,"Xiao Li, Hui Chen, Qingxia Zhu, Yan Liu, Feng Lu","Active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) embedded in the excipients of the formula can usually be unravelled by normal Raman spectroscopy (NRS). However, more and more drugs with low API content and/or low Raman scattering coefficient were insensitive to NRS analysis, which was for the first time defined as Low API-Signal Drugs (LASIDs) in this paper. The NRS spectra of these LASIDs were similar to their dominant excipients' profiles, such as lactose, starch, microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), etc., and were classified into three types as such. 21 out of 100 kinds of drugs were screened as LASIDs and characterized further by Raman microscopic mapping. Accordingly, we proposed a tailored solution to the qualitation and quantitation problem of these LASIDs, using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopic (SERS) detection on the thin layer chromatographic (TLC) plate both in situ and after-separation. Experimental conditions and parameters including TLC support matrix, SERS substrate, detection mode, similarity threshold, internal standard, etc., were optimized. All LASIDs were satisfactorily identified and the quantitation results agreed well with those of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). For some structural analogues of LASIDs, although they presented highly similar SERS spectra and were tough to distinguish even with Raman microscopic mapping, they could be successfully discriminated from each other by coupling SERS (with portable Raman spectrometer) with TLC.

Depth profiling of inks in authentic and counterfeit banknotes by electrospray laser desorption ionization/mass spectrometry.,"Yi-Ying Kao, Sy-Chyi Cheng, Chu-Nian Cheng, Jentaie Shiea","Electrospray laser desorption ionization is an ambient ionization technique that generates neutrals via laser desorption and ionizes those neutrals in an electrospray plume and was utilized to characterize inks in different layers of copy paper and banknotes of various currencies. Depth profiling of inks was performed on overlapping color bands on copy paper by repeatedly scanning the line with a pulsed laser beam operated at a fixed energy. The molecules in the ink on a banknote were desorbed by irradiating the banknote surface with a laser beam operated at different energies, with results indicating that different ions were detected at different depths. The analysis of authentic $US100, $100 RMB and $1000 NTD banknotes indicated that ions detected in 'color-shifting' and 'typography' regions were significantly different. Additionally, the abundances of some ions dramatically changed with the depth of the aforementioned regions. This approach was used to distinguish authentic $1000 NTD banknotes from counterfeits.

The commonly encountered drug impurities include elemental impurity, residual solvent, organic impurity, host cell protein and DNA, residual viral vector, extractable and leachable, and particle. They can cause various adverse effects such as immunogenicity, infection, genotoxicity, and carcinogenicity upon significant exposure. Therefore, the effective control of these drug impurities is central for patient safety. Regulations and guidelines are available for drug developers to manage them.

While the (5F)LOH acts as a molecular probe for CN(-), (2F)LOH, (1F)LOH, and (0F)LOH acts as control molecules. The reactivity of CN(-) toward (5F)LOH has been elicited through the changes observed in NMR, ESI MS, emission, and absorption spectroscopy. The conjugate (5F)LOH releases a fluorescent product upon reaction by CN(-) in aqueous acetonitrile medium by exhibiting an ∼125-fold fluorescence enhancement even in the presence of other anions. Fluorescence switch-on behavior has been clearly demonstrated on the basis of the nucleophilic substitution reaction of CN(-) on (5F)LOH. A minimum detection limit of (2.3 ± 0.3) × 10(-7) M (6 ± 1 ppb) was shown by (5F)LOH for CN(-) in solution. All the other anions studied showed no change in the fluorescence emission.

Each sequence was challenged with the visualisation of 64 natural fingermarks on eight banknotes, of which half were aged for 2-3days and half were aged for 12-13days (32 donors contributed in each set). The sequences investigated were; After each process was applied, fingermark development was assessed under primary viewing conditions appropriate to the technique (white light or fluorescence). All samples were also assessed under secondary viewing conditions; provided by the optical processes infrared reflection and long-wave ultraviolet reflection, and by gelatin lifting (with scanning). These additional techniques reduced the interfering effect of the complex banknote backgrounds and improved the contrast of enhanced fingermarks. Overall, with all assessment conditions considered, sequence 4 and sequence 3 visualised the most identifiable quality fingermarks (92.2% and 89.1% respectively). The most effective overall process used singularly was found to be black magnetic powder, provided that reflected infrared was used to image the results (82.8%). Further data analysis revealed that sequence 1 was the most effective sequence for fresh marks (aged 2-3days) when only primary viewing conditions within the visible part of the spectrum are considered. The need for further work which considers the sensitivity of the processes, and how they perform on BoE polymer banknotes that have become worn in circulation, is emphasised.",2018-01-01,Forensic Science International,"fingermark, gelatin lifting, infrared, polymer banknote, ultraviolet","adult, coloring agents, cyanoacrylates, dermatoglyphics, female, forensic sciences, gold, humans, male, middle aged, paper, powders, surface properties, united kingdom, vacuum, volatilization, young adult, zinc",10.1016/j.forsciint.2018.04.018,"Home Office CAST, Woodcock Hill, Sandridge, St. Albans, Herts AL4 9HQ, UK.

Do Drug-likeness Rules Apply to Oral Prodrugs?,"Ícaro F Protti, Daniel R Rodrigues, Sofia K Fonseca, Ricardo J Alves, Renata B De Oliveira, Vinícius G Maltarollo","This paper describes a comparative analysis of the physicochemical and structural properties of prodrugs and their corresponding drugs with regard to drug-likeness rules. The dataset used in this work was obtained from the DrugBank. Sixty-five pairs of prodrugs/drugs were retrieved and divided into the following categories: carrier-linked to increase hydrophilic character, carrier-linked to increase absorption, and bioprecursors. We compared the physicochemical properties related to drug-likeness between prodrugs and drugs. Our results show that prodrugs do not always follow Lipinski's Rule of 5, especially as we observed 15 prodrugs with more than 10 hydrogen bond acceptors and 18 with a molecular weight greater than 500 Da. This fact highlights the importance of extending Lipinski's rules to encompass other parameters as both strategies (filtering of drug-like chemical libraries and prodrug design) aim to improve the bioavailability of compounds.

Pronounced effect of lamination on plasma separation from whole blood by microfluidic paper-based analytical devices.,"Farshad Ardakani, Bahram Hemmateenejad","Many diseases are detected through blood tests. Currently, most blood tests are done on plasma instead of whole blood because of the interference of blood cells on detection results. Here, we developed a laminated microfluidic paper-based analytical device (L-μPAD) for the separation of plasma from whole blood without using plasma separation membrane (PSM). A lateral flow design consisting of a circular sampling zone and rectangular detection zone was patterned on the paper substrate using laser printing technology. The μPAD was then laminated after impregnation with KCl solution. Lamination and electrolyte addition represented synergistic effects on the separation by controlling the pore size of the paper. In addition, by preventing evaporation on one hand and squeezing paper pores on the other hand, lamination caused longer movement of the separated plasma, the longest plasma path reported so far. The separation process was monitored using colorimetric reagent bromocresol green and scanning electron microscopy. The process of separation was completed in less than 90s without significant hemolysis and the separated plasma was far from the interfering effect of red blood cells. We used the device for the determination of serum albumin.

Recent advances in lab-on-paper diagnostic devices using blood samples.,"Wen-Chin Lee, Hwee-Yeong Ng, Chih-Yao Hou, Chien-Te Lee, Lung-Ming Fu","Lab-on-paper, or microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (μPADs), use paper as a substrate material, and are patterned with a system of microchannels, reaction zones and sensing elements to perform analysis and detection. The sample transfer in such devices is performed by capillary action. As a result, external driving forces are not required, and hence the size and cost of the device are significantly reduced. Lab-on-paper devices have thus attracted significant attention for point-of-care medical diagnostic purposes in recent years, particularly in less-developed regions of the world lacking medical resources and infrastructures. This review discusses the major advances in lab-on-paper technology for blood analysis and diagnosis in the past five years. The review focuses particularly on the many clinical applications of lab-on-paper devices, including diabetes diagnosis, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) detection, kidney function diagnosis, liver function diagnosis, cholesterol and triglyceride (TG) analysis, sickle-cell disease (SCD) and phenylketonuria (PKU) analysis, virus analysis, C-reactive protein (CRP) analysis, blood ion analysis, cancer factor analysis, and drug analysis. The review commences by introducing the basic transmission principles, fabrication methods, structural characteristics, detection techniques, and sample pretreatment process of modern lab-on-paper devices. A comprehensive review of the most recent applications of lab-on-paper devices to the diagnosis of common human diseases using blood samples is then presented.

Streamlined approach to high-quality purification and identification of compound series using high-resolution MS and NMR.,"Anneke Mühlebach, Joachim Adam, Uwe Schön","Automated medicinal chemistry (parallel chemistry) has become an integral part of the drug-discovery process in almost every large pharmaceutical company. Parallel array synthesis of individual organic compounds has been used extensively to generate diverse structural libraries to support different phases of the drug-discovery process, such as hit-to-lead, lead finding, or lead optimization. In order to guarantee effective project support, efficiency in the production of compound libraries has been maximized. As a consequence, also throughput in chromatographic purification and analysis has been adapted. As a recent trend, more laboratories are preparing smaller, yet more focused libraries with even increasing demands towards quality, i.e. optimal purity and unambiguous confirmation of identity. This paper presents an automated approach how to combine effective purification and structural conformation of a lead optimization library created by microwave-assisted organic synthesis.

Chemicals can differentially distribute between in vitro assay compartments, including serum constituents in exposure medium, microtitre plate plastic, headspace and extracellular matrices. The partitioning of test chemicals to these extracellular compartments reduces the concentration at the molecular target. Free concentrations in medium and cell-associated concentrations are considered better proxies of the biologically effective dose. This paper reviews the mechanisms by which test chemicals distribute between in vitro assay compartments, and also lists the physicochemical properties driving the extent of this distribution. The mechanisms and physicochemical properties driving the distribution of test chemical in vitro help explain the makeup of mass balance models that estimate free concentrations and cell-associated concentrations in in vitro toxicity assays.

Novel analytical solutions for convolution in compartmental pharmacokinetic models and application to non-bioequivalent formulations.,"Mauricio A García, Pablo M González, Alexis Aceituno, Jozef Al-Gousous","Deconvolution and convolution are powerful tools that allow decomposition and reconstruction, respectively, of plasma versus time profiles from input and impulse functions. While deconvolution have commonly used compartmental approaches (e.g., Wagner-Nelson or Loo-Riegelman), convolution most typically used the convolution integral which can be solved with numerical methods. In 2005, an analytical solution for one-compartment pharmacokinetic was proposed and has been widely used ever since. However, to the best of our knowledge, analytical solutions for drugs distributed in more than one compartment have not been reported yet. In this paper, analytical solutions for compartmental convolution from both original and exact Loo-Riegelman approaches were developed and evaluated for different scenarios. While convolution from original approach was slightly more precise than that from the exact Loo-Riegelman, both methods were extremely accurate for reconstruction of plasma profiles after respective deconvolutions. Nonetheless, convolution from exact Loo-Riegelman was easier to interpret and to be manipulated mathematically. In fact, convolution solutions for three and more compartments can be easily written with this approach.

Portable medicine chests and supply of medicines in Serbia from the 1830s to the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century: analysis of medicines list.,"J Arsić, D Krajnović","The first portable medicine chests appeared in Serbia immediately after liberation from Ottoman rule around 1830. The network of portable medicine chests grew very quickly and became the first effective public health method of supplying medicines and medical items to people living in cities without community pharmacies and to the rural population in villages. According to their purposes, three categories of portable medicine chests could be identified: Portable medicine chests owned by physicians or veterinarians in the cities, portable medicine chests established by the Department of Workers Health Insurance, and portable medicine chests of the Health Cooperatives that operated in the villages This paper analyzes all three types of portable medicine chests. We specifically examine the regulations concerning the management of portable medicine chests, their content, and supply chains of medicines from the third decade of the 19 th century through the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. We conclude that portable medicine chests represent a specific type of pharmacy in the territory of Serbia that provided very effective medical service. The medicines in these pharmacies were handled and dispensed to patients by physicians not by pharmacists.

Scattering orthogonalization of near-infrared spectra for analysis of pharmaceutical tablets.,"Zhenqi Shi, Carl A Anderson","The paper explores scattering orthogonalization as a preprocessing technique to reduce physical interference and maintain chemical information in near-infrared (NIR) spectra of pharmaceutical tablets. Samples used in this study were tablets compressed at five compression forces; they were composed of theophylline, lactose, and microcrystalline cellulose (PH200). The NIR spectra were orthogonalized against the reduced scattering coefficients (representative of physical interference of scattering), and concentrations of all constituents were predicted. The robustness of predictions was compared to the widely employed standard normal variate (SNV) for the specificity of removing interference representative of physical parameter (such as tablet density). Group-wise cross-validation (groups were based upon similar chemical composition) and prediction demonstrated the enhanced robustness on prediction of chemical information via scattering orthogonalization in comparison to SNV. When compared to the SNV, scattering orthogonalization demonstrated an improved capacity to reduce physical interference while maintaining spectral variance attributable to chemical information.

Prospectives of Solid Self-microemulsifying Systems in Novel Drug Delivery.,"Kanav Midha, Manju Nagpal, Garima Singh, Geeta Aggarwal","More than 60% of the new drug molecules are lipophilic in nature. Low aqueous solubility and thus poor bioavailability is the main issue for these drugs for successful formulations into oral dosage form. Self-microemulsifying drug delivery systems (SMEDDS) have gained much attention. These are isotropic mixtures of different components (oil, surfactant and cosurfactant) that quickly disperse in gastrointestinal fluid yielding micro/nano-emulsions. These systems contain solubilized drug that is absorbed by lymphatic pathway along with other pathways like diffusion, collisional transfer, intracellular junctions, biliary acid pathway (BA), biliary acid mixed micelles pathway (BAMM) etc. and thus hepatic first pass metabolism is reduced. Stability of conventional SEDDS is considered very high with reference to other drug delivery systems as liposome, nanoparticles, nanoemulsion and micro emulsion. In fact SEDDS does not contain water in their composition which enhances their chemical and physical stability. Very few works have studied the stability of conventional SEDDS as it was confirmed. The major drawback for conventional SEDDS could be- i) high manufacturing cost (as they have to be filled in soft gelatin capsules); ii) interaction of capsule shell components with SEDDS. Therefore, attention has been given to transform liquid into solid SMEDDS by several techniques such as spray drying, spray cooling, super critical fluid technology and using adsorption carriers. Adsorption using solid carriers (Neusilin, Fujicalin, and dextran) is the successful inexpensive technique at initial research level whereas other requires expensive instrumentation.",,Current Drug Delivery,"adsorption, carrier, co-surfactant, fujicalin, neusilin, self-emulsification","biopharmaceutics, drug carriers, drug delivery systems, emulsions, humans, pharmaceutical preparations",10.2174/1567201813666160824123504,"Chitkara College of Pharmacy, Chitkara University, Patiala, Punjab.

The effects of temperature, sulfuric acid concentration, and mass of raw material and time on the yield of NCWs were investigated by single-factor experiments, and the preparation conditions were optimized with response surface methodology. The obtained NCWs were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and thermal gravimetry. The results showed NCWs were facilely prepared by using SUMAT. However, some harsh reaction conditions such as high temperature, strong acidity and long time treatment easily induced the reduction of the yield of NCWs.

Immobilized aptamer paper spray ionization source for ion mobility spectrometry.,"Tahereh Zargar, Taghi Khayamian, Mohammad T Jafari","A selective thin-film microextraction based on aptamer immobilized on cellulose paper was used as a paper spray ionization source for ion mobility spectrometry (PSI-IMS), for the first time. In this method, the paper is not only used as an ionization source but also it is utilized for the selective extraction of analyte, based on immobilized aptamer. This combination integrates both sample preparation and analyte ionization in a Whatman paper. To that end, an appropriate sample introduction system with a novel design was constructed for the paper spray ionization source. Using this system, a continuous solvent flow works as an elution and spray solvent simultaneously. In this method, analyte is adsorbed on a triangular paper with immobilized aptamer and then it is desorbed and ionized by elution solvent and applied high voltage on paper, respectively. The effects of different experimental parameters such as applied voltage, angle of paper tip, distance between paper tip and counter electrode, elution solvent type, and solvent flow rate were optimized. The proposed method was exhaustively validated in terms of sensitivity and reproducibility by analyzing the standard solutions of codeine and acetamiprid.

Medicating the environment: assessing risks of pharmaceuticals to wildlife and ecosystems.,"Kathryn E Arnold, A Ross Brown, Gerald T Ankley, John P Sumpter","Global pharmaceutical consumption is rising with the growing and ageing human population and more intensive food production. Recent studies have revealed pharmaceutical residues in a wide range of ecosystems and organisms. Environmental concentrations are often low, but pharmaceuticals typically are designed to have biological effects at low doses, acting on physiological systems that can be evolutionarily conserved across taxa. This Theme Issue introduces the latest research investigating the risks of environmentally relevant concentrations of pharmaceuticals to vertebrate wildlife. We take a holistic, global view of environmental exposure to pharmaceuticals encompassing terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems in high- and low-income countries. Based on both field and laboratory data, the evidence for and relevance of changes to physiology and behaviour, in addition to mortality and reproductive effects, are examined in terms of the population- and community-level consequences of pharmaceutical exposure on wildlife. Studies on uptake, trophic transfer and indirect effects of pharmaceuticals acting via food webs are presented. Given the logistical and ethical complexities of research in this area, several papers focus on techniques for prioritizing which compounds are most likely to harm wildlife and how modelling approaches can make predictions about the bioavailability, metabolism and toxicity of pharmaceuticals in non-target species.

Absorption enhancers: applications and advances.,Bruce J Aungst,"Absorption enhancers are functional excipients included in formulations to improve the absorption of a pharmacologically active drug. The term absorption enhancer usually refers to an agent whose function is to increase absorption by enhancing membrane permeation, rather than increasing solubility, so such agents are sometimes more specifically termed permeation enhancers. Absorption enhancers have been investigated for at least two decades, particularly in efforts to develop non-injection formulations for peptides, proteins, and other pharmacologically active compounds that have poor membrane permeability. While at least one product utilizing an absorption enhancer for transdermal use has reached the market, quite a few more appear to be at the threshold of becoming products, and these include oral and transmucosal applications. This paper will review some of the most advanced absorption enhancers currently in development and the formulation technologies employed that have led to their success. In addition, a more basic review of the barriers to absorption and the mechanisms by which those barriers can be surmounted is presented. Factors influencing the success of absorption-enhancing formulations are discussed. If ultimately successful, the products now in development should offer non-injection alternatives for several peptide or protein drugs currently only administered by injection. The introduction of new absorption enhancers as accepted pharmaceutical excipients, and the development of formulation technologies that afford the greatest benefit/risk ratio for their use, may create opportunities to apply these enabling technologies more broadly to existing drugs with non-optimal delivery properties.",2011-01-01,The Aaps Journal,no keywords,"animals, excipients, humans, peptides, permeability, pharmaceutical preparations, proteins, solubility, technology, pharmaceutical",10.1208/s12248-011-9307-4,"QPS, LLC, Newark, Delaware 19702, USA. bruce.aungst@qps.com"
Control and analysis of alkyl and benzyl halides and other related reactive organohalides as potential genotoxic impurities in active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).,"D P Elder, A M Lipczynski, A Teasdale","This paper continues the review of the relevant scientific literature associated with the control and analysis of potential genotoxic impurities (PGIs) in active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). The initial review [D.P. Elder, A. Teasdale, A.M. Lipczynski, J. Pharm. Biomed. Anal. 46 (2008) 1-8.] focused on the specific class of sulfonate esters but in this instance reference is made to the analysis of alkyl and benzyl halides and other related reactive organohalide alkylating agents. Such reactive materials are commonly employed in pharmaceutical research and development as raw materials, reagents and intermediates in the chemical synthesis of new drug substances. Consequently a great deal of attention and effort is extended by the innovative and ethical pharmaceutical industry to ensure that appropriate and practicable control strategies are established during drug development to ensure residues of such agents, as potential impurities in new drug substances, are either eliminated or minimized to such an extent so as to not present a significant safety risk to volunteers and patients in clinical trials and beyond. The reliable trace analysis of such reactive organohalides is central to such control strategies and invariably involves a state-of-the-art combination of high-resolution separation science techniques coupled to sensitive and selective modes of detection. This article reports on the most recent developments in the regulatory environment, overall strategies for the control of alkylating agents and the latest developments in analysis culminating in a literature review of analytical approaches. The literature is sub-categorized by separation technique (gas chromatography (GC), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), thin layer chromatography (TLC) and capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE)) and further tabulated by API type and impurity with brief method details and references.

Biomolecular Network Controllability With Drug Binding Information.,"Lin Wu, Lingkai Tang, Min Li, Jianxin Wang, Fang-Xiang Wu","Complex networks are ubiquitous in nature. In biological systems, biomolecules interact with each other to form so-called biomolecular networks, which determine the cellular behaviors of living organisms. Controlling the cellular behaviors by regulating certain biomolecules in the network is one of the most concerned problems in systems biology. Recently, the connections between biological networks and structural control theory have been explored, uncovering some interesting biological phenomena. Some researchers have paid attentions to the structural controllability of networks in notion of the minimum steering sets (MSSs). However, because the MSSs for complex networks are not unique and the importance of different MSSs is diverse in real applications, MSSs with certain meanings should be studied. In this paper, we investigated the MSSs of biomolecular networks by considering the drug binding information. The biomolecules in the MSSs with binding preference are enriched with known drug targets and are likely to have more chemical-binding opportunities with existing drugs compared with randomly chosen MSSs, suggesting novel applications for drug target identification and drug repositioning.",,Ieee Transactions On Nanobioscience,no keywords,"algorithms, computer simulation, models, biological, pharmaceutical preparations, protein binding, proteins, signal transduction",10.1109/TNB.2017.2705106,No affiliations available

NAs bind electrostatically to Q-paper, but the quantity of NA bound depends on the paper's binding capacity. To optimize the original technology for mosquito surveillance, factors that affected NA absorbance on Q-paper were evaluated. Sixteen variations of Q-paper were prepared with modifications of the derivatizing reagents and derivatization temperature. The binding capacities of these variations were determined first with 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic (BTCA), then viral RNA (purified or in infected mosquito samples) was used for validation. For this, samples with Zika (ZIKV) and chikungunya (CHIKV) RNA or virus-infected Aedes aegypti mosquito bodies were applied to sixteen Q-paper variants. Washing the paper samples with water versus elution with aqueous salt (1 M) gave samples that were analyzed for viral RNA by a PCR-based direct Luminex hybridization assay.

Evaluation of a polysaccharide-based chiral reversed-phase liquid chromatography screen strategy in pharmaceutical analysis.,"Ziqing Lin, Hua-Chia Tai, Guanghui Zhu, Abigail Fabiano, Amaris Borges-Muñoz, Yun K Ye, Brian Lingfeng He","Chirality control plays a critical role in developing stereoisomeric drugs. Due to the complexity and lack of predictability in chiral separations, column screening remains the gold standard to initiate chiral method development for active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and synthetic intermediates. Chiral reversed-phase (RP) liquid chromatography (LC) has gained favor over other modes due to its versatility and compatibility in analyzing a wide range of chiral compounds in various matrices. Herein, we established a tier-based chiral RPLC screen strategy by constructing and analyzing a database of 101 chiral screens with a total of 3,401 entries (unique LC runs) for proprietary APIs or intermediates at Bristol Myers Squibb. Up to 17 polysaccharide-based chiral stationary phases (CSPs) and four mobile phases (MPs) have been screened with gradient elution.

A novel robust hydrogel-assisted paper-based sensor based on fluorescence UiO-66-NH<sub>2</sub>@ZIF-8 for the dual-channel detection of captopril.,"Nan Wang, Zhengxuan Li, Yihan Zhao, Xushuo Wu, Chenyu Zhou, Xingguang Su","Captopril (CP) is commonly used as an active enzyme inhibitor for the treatment of coronary heart disease, hypertension and angina pectoris. The development of sensitive and efficient method for CP analysis is of great importance in biomedical research. Herein, we fabricated a sensitive and robust hydrogel-assisted paper-based sensor based on fluorescence UiO-66-NH<sub>2</sub>@ZIF-8 and Co, N-doped carbon nanozymes with oxidase-mimicking activity for accurate monitoring of captopril. The hydrogel-assisted paper-based sensor appeared a visible pink signal due to the catalytic oxidation of colorless N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine (DPD) to oxDPD by Co, N-doped carbon-based nanozymes, and resulted in the fluorescence quenching of UiO-66-NH<sub>2</sub>@ZIF-8. In the presence of captopril, the oxidation of chromogenic substrate DPD by Co, N-doped nanozymes in the hydrogel-assisted paper-based sensor was hindered and accompanied by a change in the visible color, leading to recovery of the fluorescence of UiO-66-NH<sub>2</sub>@ZIF-8, and the change in the fluorescence color could also be observed. Therefore, the quantitative detection of captopril is achieved by taking a smartphone photograph and converting the image parameters into data information using ImageJ software. The portable hydrogel-assisted paper sensor provided sensitive detection of captopril in two modes based on visible color change as well as fluorescence color change with limits of detection of 0.45 μM and 0.47 μM, respectively. This hydrogel-assisted paper-based sensor has been successfully applied to the accurate monitoring of captopril in human serum, providing a potential avenue for in situ detection of captopril.",2024-01-01,Talanta,"captopril, co, hydrogel-assisted paper-based sensor, n-doped nanozymes, uio-66-nh(2)@zif-8","captopril, paper, humans, hydrogels, metal-organic frameworks, fluorescence, limit of detection, spectrometry, fluorescence, oxidation-reduction",10.1016/j.talanta.2024.126400,"Department of Analytical Chemistry, College of Chemistry, Jilin University, Changchun, 130012, PR China.

What Can Electrochemical Methods Offer in Determining DNA-Drug Interactions?,"Sandra Ramotowska, Aleksandra Ciesielska, Mariusz Makowski","The interactions of compounds with DNA have been studied since the recognition of the role of nucleic acid in organisms. The design of molecules which specifically interact with DNA sequences allows for the control of the gene expression. Determining the type and strength of such interaction is an indispensable element of pharmaceutical studies. Cognition of the therapeutic action mechanisms is particularly important for designing new drugs. Owing to their sensitivity, simplicity, and low costs, electrochemical methods are increasingly used for this type of research. Compared to other techniques, they require a small number of samples and are characterized by a high reliability. These methods can provide information about the type of interaction and the binding strength, as well as the damage caused by biologically active molecules targeting the cellular DNA. This review paper summarizes the various electrochemical approaches used for the study of the interactions between pharmaceuticals and DNA. The main focus is on the papers from the last decade, with particular attention on the voltammetric techniques.

Prediction of passive blood-brain partitioning: straightforward and effective classification models based on in silico derived physicochemical descriptors.,"Santiago Vilar, Mayukh Chakrabarti, Stefano Costanzi","The distribution of compounds between blood and brain is a very important consideration for new candidate drug molecules. In this paper, we describe the derivation of two linear discriminant analysis (LDA) models for the prediction of passive blood-brain partitioning, expressed in terms of logBB values. The models are based on computationally derived physicochemical descriptors, namely the octanol/water partition coefficient (logP), the topological polar surface area (TPSA) and the total number of acidic and basic atoms, and were obtained using a homogeneous training set of 307 compounds, for all of which the published experimental logBB data had been determined in vivo. In particular, since molecules with logBB>0.3 cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) readily while molecules with logBB<-1 are poorly distributed to the brain, on the basis of these thresholds we derived two distinct models, both of which show a percentage of good classification of about 80%. Notably, the predictive power of our models was confirmed by the analysis of a large external dataset of compounds with reported activity on the central nervous system (CNS) or lack thereof.

"Nail disorders in older people, and aspects of their pharmaceutical treatment.",Sudaxshina Murdan,"The aim of this paper was to explore how aging influences the nail unit, its disorders and its response to treatment, and to identify some of the age-related gaps in the ungual drug delivery literature. Aging causes obvious changes to the nail, some of which are inherently due to old age, while others are due to diseases/conditions which become more prevalent as we age. Alterations in the nail plate's colour, contour, thickness, fragility, surface features, cell size, chemical composition and growth rate are some of the changes, with toenails and fingernails showing different effects. With respect to disease, the incidence of onychomycosis - the most common nail disorder - is considerably higher in older people. Similarly, brittle nails become more common as we age. In contrast, the literature about aging and the incidence of nail psoriasis is inconclusive, although, it is clear that as one gets older, the negative impact of nail psoriasis on one's quality of life decreases. Pharmaceutical treatment of the diseases comprises local and systemic therapies, sometimes in combination. Systemic therapies have the inherent disadvantages of adverse systemic effects, drug interactions and the need for monitoring, disadvantages which are especially problematic for older people who are more likely to suffer from co-morbidities and be on other medications. Topical therapy avoids such disadvantages. However, the success rates of commercially available preparations are low, and older people may need help with their application.

Deep eutectic solvents for pharmaceutical formulation and drug delivery applications.,"Shahram Emami, Ali Shayanfar","Solvents play key roles in designing drug delivery systems (DDSs). They are used as the reaction media in the preparation of DDSs and as vehicles for delivery of problematic drugs. The number of pharmaceutically acceptable solvents is limited and developing new green ones is of a great of interest. A deep eutectic solvent (DES) is a room temperature liquid composed of a mixture of hydrogen bond acceptor and hydrogen bond donor. DESs exhibit interesting physical and chemical characteristics such as low vapor pressure, non-inflammability, chemically tailorable, solvency power for a wide range of solutes, and water non-reactivity. Furthermore, they can be easily prepared from low toxicity, readily available, and inexpensive constituents. Due to these properties, DESs have attracted growing attention as green solvents in different areas of science from chemistry to material engineering and biology. In this review, after a brief introduction about DESs, we provide an overview about current advances made over the last decade in utilizing of DESs for solubilization of water insoluble drugs, transdermal drug delivery, inorganic nanoparticle synthesis, and designing polymeric and self-assembled drug carriers.

Mesoporous systems for poorly soluble drugs - recent trends.,"Joakim Riikonen, Wujun Xu, Vesa-Pekka Lehto","When poor aqueous solubility of active pharmaceutical ingredients is encountered during a drug formulation process, the toolbox typically utilized contains pharmaceutical salts, co-crystals, solid dispersions, cyclodextrins, lipids, liposomes and nanocrystals etc. Especially in the pharmaceutical industry, the option which confers the greatest benefit with the lowest risk is usually chosen. Several factors affect the final decision, but new technologies should also be considered especially if they can address several issues at the same time. Mesoporous inorganic systems are emerging technologies which can be utilized for improving the dissolution of poorly soluble drugs. The number of the scientific papers in this field is steadily increasing and the focus of the studies is moving away from in vitro to in vivo experiments with the first human trial already completed. Meanwhile, several start-up companies focusing on mesoporous carriers have been established. Therefore, it is conceivable that the first commercial products will find their way to pharmacies during the next 5-10 years. The present review surveys recent progress in research on mesoporous materials as carriers of poorly soluble drugs.

Combining surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and paper spray mass spectrometry (PS-MS) for illicit drug detection.,"Sevde Dogruer Erkok, Roxanne Gallois, Leon Leegwater, Pascal Camoiras Gonzalez, Arian Van Asten, Bruce Mccord","There is an ongoing effort in the US illicit drug market to make new psychoactive compounds more potent and addictive. Due to continuous chemical modifications, many fentanyl analogs are developed and mixed with more traditional illicit drugs, such as cocaine and heroin. Detecting fentanyl and fentanyl analogs in these illicit drug mixtures has become more crucial because of the increased potency and associated health risks. Most confirmatory procedures require time-consuming and expensive, highly sophisticated laboratory equipment and experimental procedures, which can delay critical information that might save a victim or find a suspect. In this study, we propose miniaturizing and accelerating this process by combining surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) analysis and paper spray mass spectrometry (PS-MS). For this aim, dual-purposed paper substrates were developed through soaking in Au/Ag nanostars suspensions. These novel, in-house prepared paper SERS substrates showed stability for up to four weeks with and without the presence of drug compounds. Fentanyl analogs with similar SERS spectra were differentiated by coupling with PS-MS. The limit of detection (LOD) for fentanyl on the paper substrates is 34 μg/mL and 0.32 μg/mL for SERS and PS-MS, respectively. Fentanyl and fentanyl analogs show selective SERS enhancement that helped to detect trace amounts of these opioids in heroin and cocaine street samples. In short, we propose the combination of SERS/PS-MS by using modified paper substrates to develop cost-effective, sensitive, rapid, portable, reliable, and reproducible methods to detect illicit drugs, especially trace amounts of fentanyl and fentanyl analogs in illicit drug mixtures.

Greedy and Linear Ensembles of Machine Learning Methods Outperform Single Approaches for QSPR Regression Problems.,"William Kew, John B O Mitchell","The application of Machine Learning to cheminformatics is a large and active field of research, but there exist few papers which discuss whether ensembles of different Machine Learning methods can improve upon the performance of their component methodologies. Here we investigated a variety of methods, including kernel-based, tree, linear, neural networks, and both greedy and linear ensemble methods. These were all tested against a standardised methodology for regression with data relevant to the pharmaceutical development process. This investigation focused on QSPR problems within drug-like chemical space. We aimed to investigate which methods perform best, and how the 'wisdom of crowds' principle can be applied to ensemble predictors. It was found that no single method performs best for all problems, but that a dynamic, well-structured ensemble predictor would perform very well across the board, usually providing an improvement in performance over the best single method. Its use of weighting factors allows the greedy ensemble to acquire a bigger contribution from the better performing models, and this helps the greedy ensemble generally to outperform the simpler linear ensemble.

The concept is built on the solubility-permeability interplay and the rate of supersaturation as the driving force of absorption. This paper presents the first case study using the ADDF concept where not only dissolution and solubility but also permeation of the drug is considered in every step of the formulation development. For that reason, parallel artificial membrane permeability assay (PAMPA) was used for excipient selection, small volume dissolution-permeation apparatus was used for testing amorphous solid dispersions (ASDs), and large volume dissolution-permeation tests were carried out to characterize the final dosage forms. The API-excipient interaction studies on PAMPA indicated differences when different fillers or surfactants were studied. These differences were then confirmed with small volume dissolution-permeation assays where the addition of Tween 80 to the ASDs decreased the flux dramatically. Also, the early indication of sorbitol's advantage over mannitol by PAMPA has been confirmed in the investigation of the final dosage forms by large-scale dissolution-permeation tests. This difference between the fillers was observed in vivo as well.

Dual-acting of Hybrid Compounds - A New Dawn in the Discovery of Multi-target Drugs: Lead Generation Approaches.,"Azizeh Abdolmaleki, Jahan B Ghasemi","Finding high quality beginning compounds is a critical job at the start of the lead generation stage for multi-target drug discovery (MTDD). Designing hybrid compounds as selective multitarget chemical entity is a challenge, opportunity, and new idea to better act against specific multiple targets. One hybrid molecule is formed by two (or more) pharmacophore group's participation. So, these new compounds often exhibit two or more activities going about as multi-target drugs (mtdrugs) and may have superior safety or efficacy. Application of integrating a range of information and sophisticated new in silico, bioinformatics, structural biology, pharmacogenomics methods may be useful to discover/design, and synthesis of the new hybrid molecules. In this regard, many rational and screening approaches have followed by medicinal chemists for the lead generation in MTDD. Here, we review some popular lead generation approaches that have been used for designing multiple ligands (DMLs). This paper focuses on dual- acting chemical entities that incorporate a part of two drugs or bioactive compounds to compose hybrid molecules.

Interactions between active pharmaceutical ingredients and excipients affecting bioavailability: impact on bioequivalence.,Alfredo García-Arieta,"The aim of the present paper is to illustrate the impact that excipients may have on the bioavailability of drugs and to review existing US-FDA, WHO and EMA regulatory guidelines on this topic. The first examples illustrate that small amounts of sorbitol (7, 50 or 60mg) affect the bioavailability of risperidone, a class I drug, oral solution, in contrast to what is stated in the US-FDA guidance. Another example suggests, in contrast to what is stated in the US-FDA BCS biowaivers guideline, that a small amount of sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) (3.64mg) affects the bioavailability of risperidone tablets, although the reference product also includes SLS in an amount within the normal range for that type of dosage form. These factors are considered sufficient to ensure that excipients do not affect bioavailability according to the WHO guideline. The alternative criterion, defined in the WHO guideline and used in the FIP BCS biowaivers monographs, that asserts that excipients present in generic products of the ICH countries do not affect bioavailability if used in normal amounts, is shown to be incorrect with an example of alendronate (a class III drug) tablets, where 4mg of SLS increases bioavailability more than 5-fold, although a generic product in the USA contains SLS. Finally, another example illustrates that a 2mg difference in SLS may affect bioavailability of a generic product of a class II drug, even if SLS is contained in the comparator product, and in all cases its amount was within the normal range. Therefore, waivers of in vivo bioequivalence studies (e.g., BCS biowaivers, waivers of certain dosage forms in solution at the time of administration and variations in the excipient composition) should be assessed more cautiously.",2014-01-01,European Journal Of Pharmaceutical Sciences : Official Journal Of The European Federation For Pharmaceutical Sciences,"bioavailability, biowaivers, drug–excipient interaction, excipient, regulatory requirements","administration, oral, biological availability, biopharmaceutics, excipients, humans, pharmaceutical preparations, tablets, therapeutic equivalency",10.1016/j.ejps.2014.09.004,"Head of Service on Pharmacokinetics and Generics, Division of Pharmacology and Clinical Evaluation, Department of Human Use Medicines, Spanish Agency for Medicines and Health Care Products, Madrid, Spain.

Enantiomers separation by capillary electrochromatography using polysaccharide-based stationary phases.,"Giovanni D' Orazio, María Asensio-Ramos, Chiara Fanali","The separation of chiral compounds is an interesting and important topic of research because these compounds are involved in some biological processes, fundamentally in human health. Among the various application fields where enantiomers are remarkable, drug analysis has to be considered. Most of the drugs contain enantiomers and very often one of the two isomers could be pharmacologically more active or even dangerous. Therefore, the separation of these compounds is very important. Among the different analytical techniques usually employed, capillary electrochromatography has demonstrated great capability in enantiomers resolution. The great potential of this electromigration technique stands mainly in its high efficiency due to the use of an electrosmotic flow (flat flow profile) and on the high selectivity because of the use of a stationary phase.

Schirmer Paper Noninvasive Microsampling for Direct Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Human Tears.,"Ya-Nan Yao, Dandan Di, Zi-Cheng Yuan, Lin Wu, Bin Hu","Rapid and sensitive detection of metabolites and chemical residues in human tears is highly beneficial for understanding eye health. In this study, Schirmer paper was used for noninvasive microsampling of human tears, and then paper spray mass spectrometry (PSMS) was performed for direct analysis of human tears. Schirmer PSMS was successfully used for rapid diagnosis of dry-eye syndrome by detecting the volume and metabolites of human tears. Drugs of abuse, therapeutic drugs, and pharmacodynamics in human tears were also investigated by Schirmer PSMS. Furthermore, specific markers of environmental exposures in the air to human eyes, including volatile organic compounds, aerosol, and smoke, were unambiguously sampled and detected in human tears using Schirmer PSMS. Excellent analytical performances were achieved, including single-use, low-sample consumption (1.0 μL), rapid analysis (the whole analytical procedure completed within 3 min), high sensitivity (absolute limit of detection less than or equal to 0.5 pg, signal-to-noise ratio greater than or equal to 3), good reproducibility (relative standard deviation less than 10%, <i>n</i> = 3), and accurate quantitation (average deviation less than 3%, <i>n</i> = 3).

The use of differential scanning calorimetry for the purity verification of pharmaceutical reference standards.,"S Mathkar, S Kumar, A Bystol, K Olawoore, D Min, R Markovich, A Rustum","Reference standards are routinely used in pharmaceutical industry to determine strength, content, and the quality of drug products, active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), preservatives, antioxidants and excipients. Traditionally, chromatographic techniques such as High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and Gas Chromatography (GC) in conjunction with other analytical techniques have been used to determine the purity and strength of a specific lot of a compound for the purpose of qualifying the lot to use as a reference standard. The assigned purity of the reference standard for a wide variety of compounds can be verified using an absolute method such as Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). In this paper, purity of 16 reference standards was determined by DSC and the results were then compared to the purity values that were obtained using HPLC and other analytical techniques. The results indicate that the purity obtained from DSC analysis is comparable to the chromatographic purity for organic compounds that are at least 98% pure. Use of DSC for purity determination is not appropriate if a compound lacks sharp melting point, decomposes in the defined temperature range or exhibits other thermal event(s) which interfere with the melting point of the compound.

Quantitation of parent drug and its unstable metabolites by in situ coulometric oxidation and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.,"Wei Tong, Swapan K Chowdhury, Ai-Duen Su, Kevin B Alton","Recent FDA and ICH guidances on safety testing of drug metabolites have challenged the way we traditionally think about quantitative bioanalytical methods. Such assays, in general, require a reference standard for each analyte to construct calibration curves and prepare quality control samples. However, early in the drug development process, metabolite standards may not be readily available, and if they are inherently unstable, they are difficult to synthesize or purify. In this paper, we describe a novel in-line method for producing and then quantifying a very unstable metabolite which is based upon the in situ postcolumn coulometric oxidation of the parent drug. Lacking any metabolite standards, the feasibility of simultaneously quantifying a development drug (compound A) and its unstable hydroxylated metabolites (metabolite B) was investigated. Reference standards for these ostensibly major human metabolites could not be reliably obtained due to rapid degradation upon purification and/or subsequent storage. Following high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation, parent drug and its [(13)C(3)-(15)N] isotopically labeled internal standard were quantitatively converted to equal amounts of a diastereomeric pair of hydroxylated metabolites using a postcolumn coulometric electrochemical cell before reaching the mass spectrometer. The concentration of the injected parent (which is equal to the total concentration of the in-line generated metabolites since the conversion to metabolite is quantitative) and the tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) signals of the electrochemically generated metabolites were used to construct a calibration curve for quantifying both the parent drug and its hydroxylated metabolites. Plasma extracts from humans dosed with compound A contained chromatographically distinct liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) signals (m/z 538) for in vivo formed hydroxylated metabolites and the electrochemically oxidized parent drug which had been converted in-line into its chemically identical twin. Both peaks in this study sample could be quantified using a single calibration curve obtained under the same coulometric conditions using known amounts of the parent drug. Although no attempt was made to fully validate a bioanalytical method, the practicality of this in situ quantification approach was further confirmed by the preliminary bioanalytical analysis of a selection of plasma samples collected following oral administration (50 mg) of compound A in a clinical study.",2010-01-01,Analytical Chemistry,no keywords,"carbon isotopes, chromatography, liquid, humans, hydroxylation, nitrogen isotopes, pharmaceutical preparations, tandem mass spectrometry",10.1021/ac102538s,"Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics, Merck Research Laboratories, 2015 Galloping Hill Road, Kenilworth, New Jersey 07033, United States. wei.tong@merck.com"

Pharmaceutical cocktails (up to 10 compounds simultaneously) were found in all individuals. Lincomycin was detected in all individuals, and fluoroquinolones were found at high frequencies, while NSAIDs were at low frequencies and concentrations, including flumixin meglumine, which can be lethal to vultures. A higher total number of compounds and sum of concentrations, as well as prevalence and concentration of several of the pharmaceuticals tested was found in females than in males for both nestlings and adults.

Robust identification of significant interactions between toxicogenomic biomarkers and their regulatory chemical compounds using logistic moving range chart.,"Mohammad Nazmol Hasan, Anjuman Ara Begum, Moizur Rahman, Md Nurul Haque Mollah","Identification of significant interactions between genes and chemical compounds/drugs is an important issue in toxicogenomic studies as well as in drug discovery and development. There are some online and offline computational tools for toxicogenomic data analysis to identify the biomarker genes and their regulatory chemical compounds/drugs.

We have investigated the performance of both MRC and LMRC approaches using simulated datasets. Simulation results show that both approaches perform almost equally in absence of outliers. However, in presence of outliers, the LMRC shows much better performance than the MRC.

Analysis of basic compounds by supercritical fluid chromatography: attempts to improve peak shape and maintain mass spectrometry compatibility.,"Alexandre Grand-Guillaume Perrenoud, Julien Boccard, Jean-Luc Veuthey, Davy Guillarme","While neutral and acidic compounds are well separated by supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC), basic analytes are more challenging to separate and often problems occur with their peak shapes. Two different methods were explored in the present paper to reduce these problems and maintain compatibility with mass spectrometry (MS). Five different, commercially available 2-ethylpyridine (2-EP) stationary phases were tested without a mobile phase additive using 92 pharmaceutical compounds with basic properties. The kinetic performances of the 5 columns were nearly identical, but the peak shapes of the basic drugs were strongly affected by the stationary phase. The PrincetonSFC 2-EP and Zymor Pegasus 2-EP phases clearly outperformed the other stationary phases, with 77% and 69% of the compounds having Gaussian peaks (and asymmetries between 0.8 and 1.4), respectively. Comparatively, the Waters Viridis Silica 2-EP, Waters Viridis BEH 2-EP and ES industries GreenSep 2-EP phases provided only 52%, 44% and 22% of the compounds with Gaussian peaks, respectively. These differences were attributed to the significant dissimilarities in their silica matrix properties. An alternative strategy was also performed with a hybrid silica stationary phase, Viridis BEH, using 20mM ammonium hydroxide in the mobile phase, which was a mixture of CO(2) and MeOH. With these conditions, 81% of the peaks observed for the basic analytes were Gaussian; however, this value dropped to 17% and 10% in the absence of additive and in the presence of 20mM formic acid, respectively. Finally, the use of a hybrid bare silica stationary phase in the presence of 20mM ammonium hydroxide is quite an interesting solution as this system is compatible with both ultra high performance SFC (UHPSFC) columns packed with sub-2 μm particles and with MS detection.

Automatic flow delay through passive wax valves for paper-based analytical devices.,"Haixu Meng, Chang Chen, Yonggang Zhu, Zhengtu Li, Feng Ye, Joshua W K Ho, Huaying Chen","Microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (μPADs) have been widely explored for point-of-care testing due to their simplicity, low cost, and portability. μPADs with multiple-step reactions usually require precise flow control, especially flow-delay. This paper reports the numerical, mathematical, and experimental studies of flow delay through wax valves surrounded by PDMS walls on paper microfluidics. The predried surfactant in the sample zone diffuses into the liquid sample which can therefore flow through the wax valves. The delay time is automatically regulated by the diffusion of the surfactant after sample loading. The numerical study suggested that both the elevated contact angle and the reduced porosity and pore size in the wax printed region could effectively prevent water but allow liquids with lower contact angles (<i>e.g.</i>, surfactant solutions) to flow through. The PDMS walls fabricated using a low-cost liquid dispenser effectively prevented the leakage of surfactant solutions. By controlling the quantity, diffusion distance, and type of the surfactant predried on the chip, the system successfully achieved a delay time ranging from 1.6 to 20 minutes. A mathematical model involving the above parameters was developed based on Fick's second law to predict the delay time. Finally, the flow-delay systems were applied in sequential mixing and distance-based detection of either glucose or alcohol. Linear ranges of 1-100 mg dL<sup>-1</sup> and 1-40 mg dL<sup>-1</sup> were achieved for glucose and alcohol, respectively. The lower limit detection (LOD) of glucose and alcohol was 1 mg dL<sup>-1</sup>. The LOD of glucose was only 1/11 of that detected using μPADs without flow control, indicating the advantage of controlling fluid flow.

Improvement of microemulsion electrokinetic chromatography for measuring octanol-water partition coefficients.,"Zhining Xia, Xuemei Jiang, Xiaojing Mu, Hua Chen","Microemulsion electrokinetic chromatography (MEEKC) has been used to indirectly measure octanol-water partition coefficients (log P(ow)) of compounds. In order to obtain an accurate log P(ow) value, the electrophoretic mobilities of the microemulsion phase (mu(me)) and the analyte (mu(eff)) in MEEKC must be accurately required. However, in conventional MEEKC, the shortage of obtaining mu(me) with a tracing method was discovered, and the influences of concentration, injection volume of analyte, and high electric field on measuring mu(eff) were also found. In this paper, a novel method called improved MEEKC (I-MEEKC) was developed to avoid the problems mentioned above. In I-MEEKC, a nonlinearity fitting program was used to obtain mu(me) to avoid the error from tracing mu(me); the extrapolating method was used to eliminate the effects of concentrations and injection volumes of analytes on mu(eff) measurement, and an enough stable microemulsion was selected to eliminate the effect of high electric field on mu(eff )measurement. Then the novel method was applied to estimate log P(ow) of uncharged compounds and charged pharmaceuticals compared to the conventional MEEKC. The log P(ow) of all analytes obtained by I-MEEKC agreed with those obtained by classical shake flask or literature values, the errors between them were within 0.1 logarithm units, better than the ones by conventional MEEKC.",,Electrophoresis,no keywords,"chromatography, micellar electrokinetic capillary, emulsions, octanols, pharmaceutical preparations, water",10.1002/elps.200700104,"Department of Pharmaceutics, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing, P.

According to our analysis, smart medication systems make it possible to regulate medication times and doses and detect medication errors. With further development, smart medication systems could be more be effective at preventing medication errors, improving medication adherence by older people and freeing up healthcare professional, so that they can focus on other tasks.

An integrated lateral flow assay for effective DNA amplification and detection at the point of care.,"Jane Ru Choi, Jie Hu, Yan Gong, Shangsheng Feng, Wan Abu Bakar Wan Abas, Belinda Pingguan-Murphy, Feng Xu","Lateral flow assays (LFAs) have been extensively explored in nucleic acid testing (NAT) for medical diagnostics, food safety analysis and environmental monitoring. However, the amount of target nucleic acid in a raw sample is usually too low to be directly detected by LFAs, necessitating the process of amplification. Even though cost-effective paper-based amplification techniques have been introduced, they have always been separately performed from LFAs, hence increasing the risk of reagent loss and cross-contaminations. To date, integrating paper-based nucleic acid amplification into colorimetric LFA in a simple, portable and cost-effective manner has not been introduced. Herein, we developed an integrated LFA with the aid of a specially designed handheld battery-powered system for effective amplification and detection of targets in resource-poor settings. Interestingly, using the integrated paper-based loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP)-LFA, we successfully performed highly sensitive and specific target detection, achieving a detection limit of as low as 3 × 10(3) copies of target DNA, which is comparable to the conventional tube-based LAMP-LFA in an unintegrated format.

Interest of achiral-achiral tandem columns for impurity profiling of synthetic drugs with supercritical fluid chromatography.,"Caroline West, Elise Lemasson, Sophie Bertin, Philippe Hennig, Eric Lesellier","To achieve the most complete impurity profiling of synthetic drugs with a single chromatographic technique, high resolution is required, which may be gained with a combination of high efficiency and versatile selectivity, allowing to separate most similar analytes. Compared to a single-column chromatographic method, coupling complementary stationary phases promises both an increase in efficiency and an increase in selectivity possibilities. With supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC), the use of long columns is facilitated by the low viscosity of the mobile phase. In this paper, we investigate the interest of coupling two achiral stationary phases (Acquity UPC<sup>2</sup> HSS C18 SB and Nucleoshell HILIC) that were previously observed to have excellent complementarity in SFC to carry out impurity profiling on 25 individual drug substances containing varied numbers and amounts of impurities. The single-column gradient methods are compared to tandem-column gradient methods with the two possible ordering of columns (C18 phase in first or second position) based on selectivity, peak capacity, sensitivity, UV-estimated purity of the active pharmaceutical ingredient and number of impurities detected with UV-estimated concentration >0.04%.

Identification and characterization of reactive metabolites in natural products-driven drug discovery.,"Nicholas M Njuguna, Collen Masimirembwa, Kelly Chibale","Toxicity of natural products arising from their metabolic biotransformation into reactive chemical intermediates is an important reason for high attrition rates in early drug discovery efforts. Screening promising natural products for their likelihood to form such metabolites is therefore an important step in identifying potential liabilities in the drug development process. However, such screening is complicated by the need to have test methods that are sensitive, reliable, accurate, efficient, and cost-effective enough to allow for routine identification and characterization of the reactive metabolites. These metabolites are typically formed in minute quantities, usually through minor metabolic pathways, and, due to their highly reactive and therefore transient chemical nature, pose considerable analytical challenges in attempts to determine their properties. Understanding the formation of reactive metabolites may be used as the basis for synthetic chemical modification of parent natural products aimed at bypassing such harmful bioactivation.

Regional intestinal drug permeation: biopharmaceutics and drug development.,Hans Lennernäs,"Over the last 25 years, profound changes have been seen in both the development and regulation of pharmaceutical dosage forms, due primarily to the extensive use of the biopharmaceutical classification system (BCS) in both academia and industry. The BCS and the FDA scale-up and post-approval change guidelines were both developed during the 1990s and both are currently widely used to claim biowaivers. The development of the BCS and its wide acceptance were important steps in pharmaceutical science that contributed to the more rational development of oral dosage forms. The effective permeation (Peff) of drugs through the intestine often depends on the combined outcomes of passive diffusion and multiple parallel transport processes. Site-specific jejunal Peff cannot reflect the permeability of the whole intestinal tract, since this varies along the length of the intestine, but is a useful approximation of the fraction of the oral dose that is absorbed. It appears that drugs with a jejunal Peff>1.5×10(-4)cm/s will be completely absorbed no matter which transport mechanisms are utilized. In this paper, historical clinical data originating from earlier open, single-pass perfusion studies have been used to calculate the Peff of different substances from sites in the jejunum and ileum. More exploratory in vivo studies are required in order to obtain reliable data on regional intestinal drug absorption. The development of experimental and theoretical methods of assessing drug absorption from both small intestine and various sites in the colon is encouraged. Some of the existing human in vivo data are discussed in relation to commonly used cell culture models. It is crucial to accurately determine the input parameters, such as the regional intestinal Peff, as these will form the basis for the expected increase in modeling and simulation of all the processes involved in GI drug absorption, thus facilitating successful pharmaceutical development in the future. It is suggested that it would be feasible to use open, single-pass perfusion studies for the in vivo estimation of regional intestinal Peff, but that care should be taken in the study design to optimize the absorption conditions.",2013-01-01,European Journal Of Pharmaceutical Sciences : Official Journal Of The European Federation For Pharmaceutical Sciences,"biopharmaceutical classification system, biopharmaceutics, dissolution, drug absorption, ivivc, pbpk","administration, oral, biological availability, biopharmaceutics, dosage forms, drug discovery, humans, intestinal absorption, intestinal mucosa, models, biological, permeability, pharmaceutical preparations, pharmacokinetics, solubility",10.1016/j.ejps.2013.08.025,"Department of Pharmaceutics, Uppsala University, Sweden.

Ambient Ionization Mass Spectrometry: Application and Prospective.,"Lulu Shi, Ahsan Habib, Lei Bi, Huanhuan Hong, Rockshana Begum, Luhong Wen","Mass spectrometry (MS) is a formidable analytical tool for the analysis of non-polar to polar compounds individually and/or from mixtures, providing information on the molecular weights and chemical structures of the analytes. During the last more than one-decade, ambient ionization mass spectrometry (AIMS) has developed quickly, producing a wide range of platforms and proving scientific improvements in a variety of domains, from biological imaging to quick quality control. These methods have made it possible to detect target analytes in real time without sample preparation in an open environment, and they can be connected to any MS system with an atmospheric pressure interface. They also have the ability to analyze explosives, illicit drugs, disease diagnostics, drugs in biological samples, adulterants in food and agricultural products, reaction progress, and environmental monitoring.

In the field of pharmaceutical industry, machine learning models are built to understand quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) and predict molecular activities, including absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties, using only molecular structures. Previous reports have demonstrated the advantages of using deep neural networks (DNNs) for QSAR modeling. One of the challenges while building DNN models is identifying the hyperparameters that lead to better generalization of the models. In this study, we investigated several tunable hyperparameters of deep neural network models on 24 industrial ADME data sets. We analyzed the sensitivity and influence of five different hyperparameters including the learning rate, weight decay for L2 regularization, dropout rate, activation function, and the use of batch normalization.

This paper presents a fluorescence imaging technique to visualise and characterise the emission of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) fines in model formulations containing coarse lactose carrier and 1.5-2 μm diameter fluorescent microspheres (model API fines). A two-camera arrangement was used to acquire simultaneous images of spatial and temporal distribution of model API fines and fluidised powder formulation near the mouthpiece exit of a DPI. Digital image analysis showed that the model API fines were released along with the bulk of the powder dose. More rapidly accelerating airflows were found to cause earlier release of API fines. The fluorescence imaging technique analyses a substantial fraction of the aerosol plume and was found to provide effective time-resolved characterisation of the de-aggregation and release of API fines with consistent results across a wide range of model API concentrations.

"Manufacturing classification system in the real world: factors influencing manufacturing process choices for filed commercial oral solid dosage formulations, case studies from industry and considerations for continuous processing.","Michael Leane, Kendal Pitt, Gavin K Reynolds, Neil Dawson, Iris Ziegler, Aniko Szepes, Abina M Crean, Rafaela Dall Agnol","Following the first Manufacturing Classification System (MCS) paper, the team conducted surveys to establish which active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) properties were important when selecting or modifying materials to enable an efficient and robust pharmaceutical manufacturing process. The most commonly identified factors were (1) API particle size: small particle sizes are known to increase risk of processing issues; (2) Drug loading in the formulation: high drug loadings allow less opportunity to mitigate poor API properties through the use of excipients. The next step was to establish linkages with process decisions by identifying publicly-available proxies for these important parameters: dose (in place of drug loading) and BCS class (in place of particle size). Poorly-soluble API were seen as more likely to have controlled (smaller) particle size than more highly soluble API. Analysis of 435 regulatory filings revealed that higher doses and more poorly-soluble API was associated with more complex processing routes. Replacing the proxy factors with the original parameters should give the opportunity to demonstrate stronger trends.

End-to-End Representation Learning for Chemical-Chemical Interaction Prediction.,"Sunyoung Kwon, Sungroh Yoon","Chemical-chemical interaction (CCI) plays a major role in predicting candidate drugs, toxicities, therapeutic effects, and biological functions. CCI is typically inferred from a variety of information; however, CCI has yet not been predicted using a learning-based approach. In other drug analyses, deep learning has been actively used in recent years. However, in most cases, deep learning has been used only for classification even though it has feature extraction capabilities. Thus, in this paper, we propose an end-to-end representation learning method for CCI, named DeepCCI, which includes feature extraction and a learning-based approach. Our proposed architecture is based on the Siamese network. Hidden representations are extracted from a simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES), which is a string notation representing the chemical structure using weight-shared convolutional neural networks. Subsequently, L1 element-wise distances between the two extracted hidden representations are measured. The performance of DeepCCI is compared with those of 12 fingerprint-method combinations. The proposed DeepCCI shows the best performance in most of the evaluation metrics used. In addition, DeepCCI was experimentally validated to guarantee the commutative property.

Drug nanocrystals: In vivo performances.,"Lei Gao, Guiyang Liu, Jianli Ma, Xiaoqing Wang, Liang Zhou, Xiang Li","Over the past few decades, there has been a considerable research interest in drug nanocrystal system as a pharmaceutical approach for poorly soluble drugs. At the beginning lots of works have been done to study various technologies associated with production of drug nanocrystals and their in vitro physical and chemical properties, such as morphology, formulation composition, stabilities, crystalline structure and enhanced solubility and dissolution velocity. Recently, in vivo behaviors of the nanocrystals have been generally studied in animals (including human), and the results proved that drug nanocrystals could be used as a versatile formulation to alter and improve the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and targeting properties of poorly soluble drugs. In this paper, in vivo performances of drug nanocrystals exhibited in animals in different administration route were reviewed, and the advantages of drug nanocrystals in the aspect of safety, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and targeting delivery were discussed in detail.",2012-01-01,Journal Of Controlled Release : Official Journal Of The Controlled Release Society,no keywords,"animals, drug administration routes, drug delivery systems, humans, nanoparticles, pharmaceutical preparations, pharmacokinetics",10.1016/j.jconrel.2012.03.013,"Department of Pharmacy, The First Affiliated Hospital of General Hospital of PLA, No. 51 Fucheng Road, Beijing 100048, China. business_gaolei@yahoo.cn"
"Silver nanoparticles: Synthesis, medical applications and biosafety.","Li Xu, Yi-Yi Wang, Jie Huang, Chun-Yuan Chen, Zhen-Xing Wang, Hui Xie","Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have been one of the most attractive nanomaterials in biomedicine due to their unique physicochemical properties. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art advances of AgNPs in the synthesis methods, medical applications and biosafety of AgNPs. The synthesis methods of AgNPs include physical, chemical and biological routes. AgNPs are mainly used for antimicrobial and anticancer therapy, and also applied in the promotion of wound repair and bone healing, or as the vaccine adjuvant, anti-diabetic agent and biosensors. This review also summarizes the biological action mechanisms of AgNPs, which mainly involve the release of silver ions (Ag<sup>+</sup>), generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), destruction of membrane structure. Despite these therapeutic benefits, their biological safety problems such as potential toxicity on cells, tissue, and organs should be paid enough attention. Besides, we briefly introduce a new type of Ag particles smaller than AgNPs, silver Ångstrom (Å, 1 Å = 0.1 nm) particles (AgÅPs), which exhibit better biological activity and lower toxicity compared with AgNPs.

Variation transmission model for setting acceptance criteria in a multi-staged pharmaceutical manufacturing process.,Richard O Montes,"Pharmaceutical manufacturing processes consist of a series of stages (e.g., reaction, workup, isolation) to generate the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). Outputs at intermediate stages (in-process control) and API need to be controlled within acceptance criteria to assure final drug product quality. In this paper, two methods based on tolerance interval to derive such acceptance criteria will be evaluated. The first method is serial worst case (SWC), an industry risk minimization strategy, wherein input materials and process parameters of a stage are fixed at their worst-case settings to calculate the maximum level expected from the stage. This maximum output then becomes input to the next stage wherein process parameters are again fixed at worst-case setting. The procedure is serially repeated throughout the process until the final stage. The calculated limits using SWC can be artificially high and may not reflect the actual process performance. The second method is the variation transmission (VT) using autoregressive model, wherein variation transmitted up to a stage is estimated by accounting for the recursive structure of the errors at each stage. Computer simulations at varying extent of variation transmission and process stage variability are performed. For the scenarios tested, VT method is demonstrated to better maintain the simulated confidence level and more precisely estimate the true proportion parameter than SWC. Real data examples are also presented that corroborate the findings from the simulation. Overall, VT is recommended for setting acceptance criteria in a multi-staged pharmaceutical manufacturing process.",2011-01-01,Aaps Pharmscitech,no keywords,"chemistry, pharmaceutical, computer simulation, models, theoretical, pharmaceutical preparations, quality control",10.1208/s12249-011-9734-7,"Nonclinical Statistics, Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., Kenilworth, New Jersey 07033, USA. richard.montes@merck.com"
Designs of clinical swallowability assessments of solid oral dosage forms in regulatory submissions.,"Meredith R Mcguire, Agm Mostofa, Jihong Shon, Mitchell Frost, Myong-Jin Kim, Karen Li","The swallowability of solid oral dosage forms (SODFs) is crucial for medication safety and adherence. Both regulatory agencies and sponsors are concerned with bringing swallowable SODFs to patients. However, no best practices are available for assessing swallowability. Therefore, we conducted a comparative analysis of clinical swallowability assessments (CSAs) for SODFs in regulatory submissions to identify current study design practices. CSAs were identified from a ""swallowability"" keyword search of a Food and Drug Administration database. Notable design trends among the 17 CSAs were not assessing swallowability as a primary endpoint (76 %); enrolling pediatric patients (76 %); administering assessments post-screening (76 %); and utilizing questionnaires (100 %). A design trend with near equal frequency (∼50 %) was single- or multiple-doses of product administration. Study subjects were the primary questionnaire respondents (82 %), usually using a Likert scale (92 %, 12/13). CSAs generally dichotomized the responses for analysis (65 %) without pre-specified threshold values (59 %). Overall, while study designs exhibited trends, methodology variations may impact swallowability measurements affecting the interpretation of results. Thus, developing robust and valid assessment tools for swallowability is imperative to produce clinically relevant data and inform regulatory decision-making.

In this regard, the review includes correlations between the reported solubilizing capacity of HIF and fasted or fed state simulated intestinal fluid (FaSSIF/FeSSIF). Correlating with HIF solubilities enables the optimal use of solubility measurements in simulated biorelevant media to obtain accurate estimates of intestinal solubility during drug development.

Development of a predictive algorithm for the efficacy of half-life extension strategies.,Patrick M Glassman,"A challenge in development of peptide and protein therapeutics is rapid elimination from the body, necessitating frequent dosing that may lead to toxicities and/or poor patient compliance. To solve this issue, there has been great investment into half-life extension of rapidly eliminated drugs using approaches such as albumin binding, fusion to albumin or Fc, or conjugation to polyethylene glycol. Despite clinical successes of half-life extension products, no clear relationship has been drawn between properties of drugs and the pharmacokinetic parameters of their half-life extended analogues. In this study, non-compartmentally derived pharmacokinetic parameters (half-life, clearance, volume of distribution) were collected for 186 half-life extended drugs and their unmodified parent molecules. Statistical testing and regression analysis was performed to evaluate relationships between pharmacokinetic parameters and a matrix of variables. Multivariate linear regression models were developed for each of the three pharmacokinetic parameters and model predictions were in good agreement with observed data with r<sup>2</sup> values for each parameter being: half-life: 0.879, clearance: 0.820, volume of distribution: 0.937. Significant predictors for each parameter included the corresponding pharmacokinetic parameter of the parent drug and descriptors related to molecular weight.

Detection and Quantitation of Trace Fentanyl in Heroin by Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy.,"Abed Haddad, Mircea A Comanescu, Omar Green, Thomas A Kubic, John R Lombardi","The identification of fentanyl, a main culprit in opioid overdose deaths, has become critical. Whereas Raman spectroscopy is an effective tool for detecting illicit drugs, the weak intensity of Raman scattering can make it difficult to distinguish trace materials. This shortcoming is addressed by surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), which produces strong signal enhancements when target compounds are near metal nanoparticles. This work examines the use of a paper-based substrate impregnated with silver nanoparticles for the detection of trace quantities of fentanyl alone and as an adulterant in heroin. In addition, intensity ratios of diagnostic peaks associated with each substance were fitted to a Langmuir isotherm calibration model and used for the quantitative analysis of fentanyl in heroin mixtures. Linearity was observed at <6% fentanyl, a significant finding that is consistent with concentrations found in drugs seized during law enforcement efforts. In addition, swabbing with these paper-based SERS substrates facilitated the recovery of fentanyl from surfaces, showing this to be applicable for crime scene investigations. However, assessment using the calibration model proved difficult for swabbed samples.
