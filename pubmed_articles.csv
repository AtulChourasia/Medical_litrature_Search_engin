Aging as disease.,Gunnar De Winter,"In this paper, I will argue that ageing can be construed as disease. First, the concept of disease is discussed, where the distinction is made between two lines of thought, an objectivist and a subjectivist one. After determining the disease conception to be used throughout the argument, it is proposed that senescence could be seen as disease. Three common counterarguments are discussed, none of which appears strong enough to effectively counter the advocated view. In the third section, two potential implications of the view advocated here will be briefly touched upon. These are the quest for a cure or treatment for ageing and the general attitude towards the elderly. It is concluded that, utilizing an objective disease concept, ageing could be seen as a disease. None of the considered counterarguments packs enough of a punch to discard this. The implications are complex and intertwined, but need not be negative.",No date available,"Medicine, health care, and philosophy",No keywords,"Adaptation, Psychological, Aging, Disease, Humans, Medicalization, Philosophy, Medical",10.1007/s11019-014-9600-y,"Department of Philosophy, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK, gunnardewinter.2011@my.bristol.ac.uk."

Scientific Papers and Patents on Substances with Unproven Effects.,Sergei V Jargin,"It is evident from reviewing scientific literature that the quality of argumentation in some areas of medical research has deteriorated during the last decades. Publication of a series of questionable reliability has continued without making references to the published criticism; examples are discussed in this review. Another tendency is that drugs without proven efficiency are advertised, corresponding products patented and marketed as evidence-based medications. Professional publications are required to register drugs and dietary supplements to obtain permissions for the practical use; and such papers appeared, sometimes being of questionable reliability. Several examples are discussed in this review when substances without proven effects were patented and introduced into practice being supported by publications of questionable reliability. Some of the topics are not entirely clear; and the arguments provided here can induce a constructive discussion.",No date available,Recent patents on drug delivery & formulation,"Placebo, antioxidants, atherosclerosis, cardiovascular, dietary supplements, hormesis.","Antioxidants, Dietary Supplements, Evidence-Based Medicine, Humans, Patents as Topic, Periodicals as Topic, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Treatment Outcome",10.2174/1872211313666190307162041,"Peoples' Friendship University of Russia, Clementovski per 6-82, 115184 Moscow, Russian Federation."
Advances in Paper-Based Analytical Devices.,"Tugba Ozer, Catherine McMahon, Charles S Henry","Microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (μPADs) are the newest generation of lab-on-a-chip devices and have made significant strides in both our understanding of fundamental behavior and performance characteristics and expansion of their applications. μPADs have become useful analytical techniques for environmental analysis in addition to their more common application as medical point-of-care devices. Although the most common method for device fabrication is wax printing, numerous other techniques exist and have helped address factors ranging from solvent compatibility to improved device function. This review highlights recent reports of fabrication and design, modes of detection, and broad applications of μPADs. Such advances have enabled μPADs to be used in field and laboratory studies to address critical needs in fast, cheaper measurement technologies.",2020,"Annual review of analytical chemistry (Palo Alto, Calif.)","biomedical diagnostics, biosensors, environmental, microfluidics, paper-based","Lab-On-A-Chip Devices, Paper, Point-of-Care Systems",10.1146/annurev-anchem-061318-114845,"Department of Chemistry, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado 80526, USA; email: Chuck.Henry@colostate.edu., Department of Chemistry, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado 80526, USA; email: Chuck.Henry@colostate.edu., Department of Chemistry, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado 80526, USA; email: Chuck.Henry@colostate.edu."
"Is non-medical use normal? Normalisation, medicalisation and pharmaceutical consumption.",George Christopher Dertadian,"The theory of the normalisation of youth drug use in advanced capitalist societies has had an enduring legacy in contemporary drug scholarship. While the literature on the normalisation of 'illicit' drugs is well developed, less has been written about application of the theory to emerging discourse of pharmaceutical 'abuse', and how this might necessitate different thinking around what can be considered normal consumption. Pharmaceuticals are not directly associated with criminality, and their use does not traditionally attract stigma. In fact, social science scholarship has illustrated how many substances deemed illicit are normalised in the context of an ever-growing set of medical treatments. This paper explores the assumptions about legality, sociality and pleasure which sit behind the drug normalisation thesis, by reflecting on the relevance of drug normalisation in relation to pharmaceuticals, as well as examining scholarship on the medicalisation of society and qualitative research on non-medical use to illustrate the parallel processes of normalisation that apply to pharmaceuticals. The paper argues that questions of normalisation in relation to pharmaceutical use require a deeper engagement with the normative expectations we attach to pleasure, consumption and medicine, and the way this is structured by proximity to medical authority, whiteness and middle-classness.",2023,The International journal on drug policy,"Medicalisation, Middle-class, Non-medical use, Normalisation, Pharmaceuticalisation, Pharmaceuticals, White, Youth","Adolescent, Humans, Illicit Drugs, Social Behavior, Pleasure, Qualitative Research, Medicalization",10.1016/j.drugpo.2023.104123,"Centre for Crime, Law and Justice, Faculty of Law and Justice, UNSW, Sydney, Australia.

Drug interactions of cola-containing drinks.,"Homa Nomani, Ali Tafazoli Moghadam, Seyed Ahmad Emami, Amir Hooshang Mohammadpour, Thomas P Johnston, Amirhossein Sahebkar","Cola-containing drinks (CCDs) are among the most common drinks in the world. There are some reports on interactions between CCDs and some drugs. However, there is no review on reported and possible interactions of CCDs. Thus, this paper attempted to provide a comprehensive review on this subject. It is well-accepted that CCDs are acidic and contain caffeine. It has been suggested that these two properties potentiate interactions of CCDs with different drugs in the context of both pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic, which includes drug absorption, metabolism, and renal excretion of drugs. It has been shown that serum concentrations of MTX, clozapine, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and ibuprofen increased following CCD consumption; these interactions can be toxic. Additionally, it has been reported that serum levels of lithium and warfarin were decreased and their efficacy reduced when simultaneously administered with CCDs. Serum concentrations of erlotinib and different azoles, including itraconazol, posaconazole, and ketoconazole, have been shown to increase when these drugs were co-administered with a CCD. As proposed and discussed here, CCDs have the potential for interactions with numerous other drugs and thus clinicians should be aware of reported and potential interactions of CCDs with various medications in order to avoid adverse reactions and achieve expected clinical response.",2019,"Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)","Cola-containing drinks, Drug interactions, Pharmacodynamics, Pharmacokinetics","Animals, Biomedical Research, Carbonated Beverages, Cola, Drug Interactions, Humans, Pharmaceutical Preparations",10.1016/j.clnu.2019.01.029,"School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran., Clinical Pharmacy Department, School of Pharmacy, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Iran., Department of Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran., Department of Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran; Pharmaceutical Research Center, Pharmaceutical Technology Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.

Stratified medicalization of schooling difficulties.,Rachel Elizabeth Fish,"Medicalization is a central topic of concern in the sociology of disability and of health and illness. In this paper, I examine how medicalization is inequitably applied and circulates in the context of schools, specifically in serving students with educational disabilities. My aim is to advance understandings of medicalization through this case. Using a mixed-methods design, I first show, descriptively, how race and gender intersectionally predict educational disability status in a dataset of all Wisconsin public school students. Next, I examine how racial and gender disparities in disability status are produced at the micro level, using interviews with 27 Wisconsin teachers, including in-depth discussions of 73 individual students that were struggling academically or behaviorally. My quantitative findings show variation by race, gender, and disability category: White children have higher probability of special education receipt than comparable children of color for academic difficulties, but lower probability for behavioral difficulties, and girls have lower probability than comparable boys overall. My interview data suggest that these disparate outcomes reflect stratified medicalization processes, in which institutional constraints, status beliefs, and cultural discourses of race and gender shape both stratified noticing of schooling difficulties and stratified interpretation of those difficulties as medicalized conditions.",2022,Social science & medicine (1982),"Disability, Education, Gender, Medicalization, Mixed-methods, Race","Child, Cognition, Educational Status, Female, Humans, Male, Medicalization, Schools, Students",10.1016/j.socscimed.2022.115039,"New York University, USA.

Tablets made from paper.,"Florian Stumpf, Cornelia M Keck","The possibility to compress ordinary paper into tablets was systematically investigated in this study. Results proved that tablets can be made from paper, independent of the type of paper used. The tablets appear shiny and with a smooth surface. The pharmaceutical quality was acceptable, i.e. all tablets fulfilled the requirements for tablets according to the European Pharmacopeia. Drug-loaded tablets were produced by compression of drug-loaded paper. Drug loading did not alter the pharmaceutical quality. However, the uncoated tablets possessed an extremely fast disintegration, i.e. intense swelling upon contact with water, which might hamper the swallowing after oral administration. To avoid swelling tablets were successfully coated with a polymer film, leading to a prevention of swelling but immediate disintegration in simulated gastric fluid. In fact, tablets made from paper are a novel and promising strategy for improved oral drug delivery. They can be easily produced without any further excipients and possess pharmaceutical quality according to the European Pharmacopeia.",2018,International journal of pharmaceutics,"Drug release, Individualized therapy, Oral drug delivery, Paper, Poorly soluble APIs, Tablets, Tissue","Chemistry, Pharmaceutical, Drug Liberation, Paper, Tablets",10.1016/j.ijpharm.2018.05.071,"Department of Pharmaceutics and Biopharmaceutics, Philipps-Universität Marburg, Marburg, Germany., Department of Pharmaceutics and Biopharmaceutics, Philipps-Universität Marburg, Marburg, Germany.

"Pharmaceutical cocrystals, salts and polymorphs: Advanced characterization techniques.","Edyta Pindelska, Agnieszka Sokal, Waclaw Kolodziejski","The main goal of a novel drug development is to obtain it with optimal physiochemical, pharmaceutical and biological properties. Pharmaceutical companies and scientists modify active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), which often are cocrystals, salts or carefully selected polymorphs, to improve the properties of a parent drug.

Thus, diffraction, spectroscopic, thermal and also pharmaceutical characterization methods are discussed. They all are necessary to study a solid API in its intrinsic complexity from bulk down to the molecular level, gain information on its structure, properties, purity and possible transformations, and make the characterization efficient, comprehensive and complete.

The concept of medicalisation reassessed.,Joan Busfield,"Medicalisation has been an important concept in sociological discussions of medicine since its adoption by medical sociologists in the early 1970s. Yet it has been criticised by some sociologists, in part because it seems too negative about medicine, and modified or replaced by others with concepts deemed more relevant like biomedicalisation and pharmaceuticalisation. My aim in this paper is to reassess the concept and consider whether it still has value in exploring significant aspects of the role of medicine in present-day society. I start with an archaeology of the concept's development and the different ways it has been used. This covers some familiar ground but is essential to the main task: examining criticisms of the concept and assessing its value. I conclude that the concept continues to have a crucial and productive place in sociological analyses of medicine and that the process of medicalisation is still a key feature of late-modern social life and culture.",2017,Sociology of health & illness,"medical practice/medical work, medicalisation, pharmaceuticals/pharmaceutical companies, power, professions/professionalisation","History, 20th Century, History, 21st Century, Humans, Medicalization, Power, Psychological, Sociology, Medical",10.1111/1467-9566.12538,"Department of Sociology, University of Essex, UK."
In vivo deposition of poorly soluble drugs.,"Zhaohuan Lou, Chaofeng Mu, Clairissa D Corpstein, Tonglei Li","Administered drug molecules, whether dissolved or solubilized, have the potential to precipitate and accumulate as solid forms in tissues and cells within the body. This phase transition can significantly impact the pharmacokinetics of treatment. It is thus crucial to gain an understanding of how drug solubility/permeability, drug formulations and routes of administration affect in vivo behaviors of drug deposition. This review examines literature reports on the drug deposition in tissues and cells of poorly water-soluble drugs, as well as underlying physical mechanisms that lead to precipitation. Our work particularly highlights drug deposition in macrophages and the subcellular fate of precipitated drugs. We also propose a tissue permeability-based classification framework to evaluate precipitation potentials of poorly soluble drugs in major organs and tissues.

Modular design principle based on compartmental drug delivery systems.,"Georgios K Eleftheriadis, Natalja Genina, Johan Boetker, Jukka Rantanen","The current manufacturing solutions for oral solid dosage forms are fundamentally based on technologies from the 19th century. This approach is well suited for mass production of one-size-fits-all products; however, it does not allow for a straight-forward personalization and mass customization of the pharmaceutical end-product. In order to provide better therapies to the patients, a need for innovative manufacturing concepts and product design principles has been rising. Additive manufacturing opens up a possibility for compartmentalization of drug products, including design of spatially separated multidrug and functional excipient compartments. This compartmentalized solution can be further expanded to modular design thinking. Modular design is referring to combination of building blocks containing a given amount of drug compound(s) and related functional excipients into a larger final product. Implementation of modular design principles is paving the way for implementing the emerging personalization potential within health sciences by designing compartmental and reactive product structures that can be manufactured based on the individual needs of each patient. This review will introduce the existing compartmentalized product design principles and discuss the integration of these into edible electronics allowing for innovative control of drug release.",2021,Advanced drug delivery reviews,"3D printing, Additive manufacturing, Compartmental systems, Digital reconstruction, Drug delivery, Ingestible electronics, Intellectual property, Modular systems, Smart medications","Drug Delivery Systems, Drug Design, Drug Liberation, Humans, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Technology, Pharmaceutical",10.1016/j.addr.2021.113921,"Department of Pharmacy, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, GR-54124 Thessaloniki, Greece., Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark., Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark., Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.

Therapeutic management in the low-wage workplace.,Emily H Ruppel,"Medicalization represents an increasingly significant form of social control. Emergent evidence suggests that workplace managers take up medicalized practices and discourses to produce a compliant labor force, but this phenomenon has received limited sociological attention. This paper extends prior theories of medicalization to investigate therapeutic management in the low-wage workplace.

Should UK based Physiotherapists Choose Wisely?,Graham Copnell,"In 2012 the Choose Wisely campaign was launched in the United States in order to address concerns regarding medicalisation, over diagnosis and medical consumerism. The campaign has now spread internationally and includes a number of countries including Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Germany. The primary aim of the campaign is to facilitate healthcare professionals and patients to question the overall utility of medical interventions. Professionals through their professional organisations identify at least five commonly used interventions or tests, within their areas of speciality, which they feel provided no or little benefit to patients. This paper provides the background to the Choose Wisely campaign. The paper reviews the concepts of medicalisation, over diagnosis and medical consumerism, before considering the utility of the campaign in the UK alongside other forms of governance such as NICE.

Paper-Based Fluidic Sensing Platforms for β-Adrenergic Agonist Residue Point-of-Care Testing.,"Hongzhi Luo, Shan Liu, Lina Shi, Zhu Li, Qianwen Bai, Xiaoxin Du, Lijun Wang, He Zha, Chenzhong Li","The illegal use of β-adrenergic agonists during livestock growth poses a threat to public health; the long-term intake of this medication can cause serious physiological side effects and even death. Therefore, rapid detection methods for β-adrenergic agonist residues on-site are required. Traditional detection methods such as liquid chromatography have limitations in terms of expensive instruments and complex operations. In contrast, paper methods are low cost, ubiquitous, and portable, which has led to them becoming the preferred detection method in recent years. Various paper-based fluidic devices have been developed to detect β-adrenergic agonist residues, including lateral flow immunoassays (LFAs) and microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (μPADs). In this review, the application of LFAs for the detection of β-agonists is summarized comprehensively, focusing on the latest advances in novel labeling and detection strategies. The use of μPADs as an analytical platform has attracted interest over the past decade due to their unique advantages and application for detecting β-adrenergic agonists, which are introduced here. Vertical flow immunoassays are also discussed for their shorter assay time and stronger multiplexing capabilities compared with LFAs. Furthermore, the development direction and prospects for the commercialization of paper-based devices are considered, shedding light on the development of point-of-care testing devices for β-adrenergic agonist residue detection.",2022,Biosensors,"biosensors, lateral flow immunoassay, microfluidics, paper-based device, point-of-care testing, β-adrenergic agonists","Adrenergic beta-Agonists, Immunoassay, Lab-On-A-Chip Devices, Microfluidic Analytical Techniques, Paper, Point-of-Care Systems, Point-of-Care Testing",518,"Department of Laboratory Medicine, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University (The First People's Hospital of Zunyi), Zunyi 563002, China., Sichuan Provincial Key Laboratory for Human Disease Gene Study, Department of Medical Genetics, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences & Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu 610072, China., School of Medicine, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu 610054, China., College of Medical Technology, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu 610075, China., Sichuan Jinxin Women & Children Hospital, Chengdu 610066, China., Office of Scientific Research & Development, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu 610054, China., Department of Ophthalmology, The Third People's Hospital of Chengdu, The Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu 610031, China., Department of Laboratory Medicine, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University (The First People's Hospital of Zunyi), Zunyi 563002, China., Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Medicine, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA 70112, USA."
Controlling Fluorescent Readout in Paper-based Analytical Devices.,"Anna Luongo, Alexander Ritter von Stockert, Frank D Scherag, Thomas Brandstetter, Markus Biesalski, Jürgen Rühe","Paper is an ideal candidate for the development of new disposable diagnostic devices because it is a low-cost material, allows transport of the liquid on the device by capillary action, and is environmentally friendly. Today, colorimetric analysis is most often used as a detection method for rapid tests (test strips or lateral flow devices) but usually gives only qualitative results and is limited by a relatively high detection threshold. Here, we describe studies using fluorescence as a readout tool for paper-based diagnostics. We study how the optical readout is affected by light transmission, scattering, and fluorescence as a function of paper characteristics such as thickness (grammage), water content, autofluorescence, and paper type/composition. We show that paper-based fluorescence analysis allows better optical readout compared to that of nitrocellulose, which is currently the material of choice in colorimetric assays. To reduce the loss of analyte molecules (e.g., proteins) due to adsorption to the paper surface, we coat the paper fibers with a protein-repellent hydrogel. For this purpose, we use hydrophilic copolymers consisting of <i>N</i>,<i>N</i>-dimethyl acrylamide and a benzophenone-based cross-linker, which are photochemically transformed into a fiber-attached polymer hydrogel on the paper fiber surfaces in situ. We show that the combination of fluorescence detection and the use of a protein-repellent coating enables sensitive paper-based analysis.

A critique of medicalisation: three instances.,Sonia Ryang,"By briefly exploring three different examples where the existence of mental illness and developmental delay has been presumed, this paper sheds light on the way what Foucault calls the emergence of a regime of truth, i.e. where something that does not exist is made to exist through the construction of a system of truth around it. The first example concerns the direct marketing of pharmaceutical products to consumers in the US, the second the use of psychology in semi-post-Cold War Korea, and the third the persisting authority of psychology in the treatment of the developmentally delayed. While these instances are not innately connected, looking at these as part of the process by which the authoritative knowledge is established will help us understand, albeit partially, the mechanism by which mental illness penetrates our lives as truth, and how this regime of truth is supported by the authority of psychology, psychiatry and psychoanalysis, what Foucault calls the 'psy-function,' reinforcing the medicalisation of our lives.",No date available,Anthropology & medicine,"Foucault, Psy-function, mental illness, truth","Anthropology, Medical, Direct-to-Consumer Advertising, Humans, Medicalization, Mental Disorders, Psychiatry, Psychometrics, Psychotropic Drugs",10.1080/13648470.2017.1389169,"a Chao Center for Asian Studies , Rice University , Houston , TX , USA."

Stability and compatibility of parenteral nutrition solutions; a review of influencing factors.,"Mahmoud Farhan, Naomi McCallion, Joanne Bennett, Anne Cram, Fiona O'Brien","Both stability and compatibility of parenteral nutrition solutions (PNS) with drug products are major concerns for clinicians and clinical pharmacists, especially when concurrent administration of PNS with intravenous medications (IVM) is unavoidable. Since the same physicochemical principles apply to both adult's and paediatrics' PNS, concerns about stability and compatibility may still apply to both. However, these concerns are relatively more common in paediatrics and neonatal clinical settings, where limited vascular access can be problematic and the coadministration of PNS and drugs is more common. In neonatal and paediatric populations, there have been few experimental studies and comprehensive evaluations looking at medication compatibility with frequently used PNS. This work is part of a larger research project concerned for compatibility of PNS with commonly used intravenous medication in paediatric and neonates. This paper captures and reviews published data on factors influencing stability and compatibility of parenteral nutrition solutions. This information will help clinicians and clinical pharmacists to understand the principals of the stability and compatibility of PNS, furthermore, it will inform better design of future compatibility studies, as it highlights the complexity of PNS and the multiple factors influencing the stability of PNS, and hence its compatibility with IVM. When preparing, prescribing, and administering the PNS, especially when co-administration with IVM is unavoidable, it is important to take into account the physicochemical properties of the PNS components and IVM as well as administration conditions and environmental factors. These factors should also be considered in the design of the compatibility studies of the PNS with the IVM.",2023,European journal of pharmaceutics and biopharmaceutics : official journal of Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Pharmazeutische Verfahrenstechnik e.V,"Amino acids, Compatibility, Glucose, Intravenous medication, Lipid, Parenteral nutrition solutions, Stability","Infant, Newborn, Humans, Child, Parenteral Nutrition Solutions, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Drug Stability",10.1016/j.ejpb.2023.04.002,"School of Postgraduate Studies, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Dublin, Ireland.

Reducing Unspecific Protein Adsorption in Microfluidic Papers Using Fiber-Attached Polymer Hydrogels.,"Alexander Ritter von Stockert, Anna Luongo, Markus Langhans, Thomas Brandstetter, Jürgen Rühe, Tobias Meckel, Markus Biesalski","Microfluidic paper combines pump-free water transport at low cost with a high degree of sustainability, as well as good availability of the paper-forming cellulosic material, thus making it an attractive candidate for point-of-care (POC) analytics and diagnostics. Although a number of interesting demonstrators for such paper devices have been reported to date, a number of challenges still exist, which limit a successful transfer into marketable applications. A strong limitation in this respect is the (unspecific) adsorption of protein analytes to the paper fibers during the lateral flow assay. This interaction may significantly reduce the amount of analyte that reaches the detection zone of the microfluidic paper-based analytical device (µPAD), thereby reducing its overall sensitivity. Here, we introduce a novel approach on reducing the nonspecific adsorption of proteins to lab-made paper sheets for the use in µPADs. To this, cotton linter fibers in lab-formed additive-free paper sheets are modified with a surrounding thin hydrogel layer generated from photo-crosslinked, benzophenone functionalized copolymers based on poly-(oligo-ethylene glycol methacrylate) (POEGMA) and poly-dimethyl acrylamide (PDMAA).

Furthermore, by evaporating the transport fluid during the microfluidic run at the end of the paper strip through local heating, model proteins can almost quantitatively be accumulated in that zone.

"Medicalisation, pharmaceuticalisation, or both? Exploring the medical management of sleeplessness as insomnia.","Catherine Coveney, Simon J Williams, Jonathan Gabe","In this paper we examine the medical management of sleeplessness as 'insomnia', through the eyes of general practitioners (GPs) and sleep experts in Britain. Three key themes were evident in the data. These related to (i) institutional issues around advocacy and training in sleep medicine (ii) conceptual issues in the diagnosis of insomnia (iii) and how these played out in terms of treatment issues. As a result, the bulk of medical management occurred at the primary rather than secondary care level. These issues are then reflected on in terms of the light they shed on relations between the medicalisation and the pharmaceuticalisation of sleeplessness as insomnia. Sleeplessness, we suggest, is only partially and problematically medicalised as insomnia to date at the conceptual, institutional and interactional levels owing to the foregoing factors. Much of this moreover, on closer inspection, is arguably better captured through recourse to pharmaceuticalisation, including countervailing moves and downward regulatory pressures which suggest a possible degree of depharmaceuticalisation in future, at least as far prescription hypnotics are concerned. Pharmaceuticalisation therefore, we conclude, has distinct analytical value in directing our attention, in this particular case, to important dynamics occurring within if not beyond the medicalisation of sleeplessness as insomnia.",2018,Sociology of health & illness,"drugs/medication, interviewing (qualitative), medical knowledge, medicalisation, primary care, sleep","Attitude of Health Personnel, Female, General Practitioners, Humans, Hypnotics and Sedatives, Male, Medicalization, Prescription Drugs, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders, United Kingdom",10.1111/1467-9566.12820,"School of Applied Social Sciences, De Montfort University, Leicester, UK., Department of Sociology, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK., Criminology & Sociology, School of Law, Royal Holloway, Egham, UK."
"Medical diagnosis of dyslexia in a Swedish elite school: A case of ""consecrating medicalization"".",Mikael Holmqvist,"Based on qualitative data of an upper-secondary school in Sweden's primary elite community, Djursholm, I propose how medical diagnosis of students as dyslexics contributes to consecrating them by offering a short cut to successful performance, while at the same time reproducing differences between social classes. The study suggests how students that do not score top can be labeled dyslexic and the social and moral consequences of that. I introduce the concept of ""consecrating medicalization"" in order to discriminate between the effects of medical diagnosis of members of different social classes.

The medico-legal significance of pharmacokinetic interactions with ethanol.,"N J Langford, R E Ferner","In the UK, the maximal permitted ethanol concentration for driving is 80 mg ethanol/100 mL blood, 35 μg ethanol/100 mL breath or 107 mg ethanol/100 mL urine. Drivers exceeding the prescribed limit face severe penalties, which they are often anxious to avoid, either by acquittal or by putting forward 'special reasons' why they should not be disqualified from driving. One frequently explored defence is that the accused was taking prescribed medication. Defence solicitors often ask the question whether the prescribed medication could have caused significantly altered blood ethanol concentrations.

Deficiencies were identified in medication management in operating theatres (OT) at a large tertiary hospital. A perioperative pharmacist was employed for a 6-month pilot period, with permanent funding dependent on demonstration of agreed economic benefits. A multidisciplinary committee set goals, drove strategic initiatives and was accountable for delivery of outcomes. Pharmaceutical expenditure was analysed and high expenditure items targeted. Cost savings and staff satisfaction were measured at 6 months. Savings of A$63884 were achieved during the pilot period, resulting from optimised pharmaceutical unit pricing, OT medication stock on hand (imprest) review and redesigned medication management strategies. Improvements in medication management included better access to medications in the OT, rationalising available products to minimise wastage and implementation of guidelines and protocols for high-cost and high-risk medications. At 6 months, 97% of theatre staff supported continuation of the role; the project was extended with demonstrated cost savings of A$157265 at 12 months.

Review of patents for microneedle application devices allowing fluid injections through the skin.,"Marion S Lhernould, Serge Tailler, Michel Deleers, Alain Delchambre","Microneedles have been developed in the past few years as a new means of transdermal drug delivery. They indeed present many advantages compared to injections using hypodermic needles (reduced risk of contamination and epidermic reactions), but mostly bring comfort and compliance to patients. Microneedles may be plain, opening pathways for medications to dissolve into the skin, or hollow, allowing fluid to actually enter the dermis or the hypodermis. This review focuses on the latter type of microneedles and two issues with their application: first, ensuring correct insertion into the skin (controlled and repeatable insertion depth, mainly); and second, ensuring correct fluid delivery to the dermis (controlled infusion rate). This paper thus focuses on recently published patents for hollow microneedle applicators-i.e., microneedles applicators that allow fluid delivery to the skin.

Comprehensive Review on Drug-target Interaction Prediction - Latest Developments and Overview.,"Ali K Abdul Raheem, Ban N Dhannoon","Drug-target interactions (DTIs) are an important part of the drug development process. When the drug (a chemical molecule) binds to a target (proteins or nucleic acids), it modulates the biological behavior/function of the target, returning it to its normal state. Predicting DTIs plays a vital role in the drug discovery (DD) process as it has the potential to enhance efficiency and reduce costs. However, DTI prediction poses significant challenges and expenses due to the time-consuming and costly nature of experimental assays. As a result, researchers have increased their efforts to identify the association between medications and targets in the hopes of speeding up drug development and shortening the time to market. This paper provides a detailed discussion of the initial stage in drug discovery, namely drug-target interactions. It focuses on exploring the application of machine learning methods within this step. Additionally, we aim to conduct a comprehensive review of relevant papers and databases utilized in this field. Drug target interaction prediction covers a wide range of applications: drug discovery, prediction of adverse effects and drug repositioning. The prediction of drugtarget interactions can be categorized into three main computational methods: docking simulation approaches, ligand-based methods, and machine-learning techniques.",No date available,Current drug discovery technologies,"Machine learning, chemoinformatics, drug discovery, drug-target interactions, medications., prediction computational models","Humans, Drug Discovery, Machine Learning, Molecular Docking Simulation, Ligands, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Drug Repositioning, Proteins",10.2174/1570163820666230901160043,"Software Department, College of Information Technology, University of Babylon, Hillah, Babil, Iraq., Department of Computer Science, College of Science, Al-Nahrain University, Baghdad, Iraq."

Achievements in robotic automation of solvent extraction and related approaches for bioanalysis of pharmaceuticals.,"Michal Alexovič, Yannis Dotsikas, Peter Bober, Ján Sabo","Currently, the growing demand on quick, easy and ecological sample pretreatment methods is unquestionable. Such challenge involves also approaches focusing on the analysis of pharmaceuticals and other endogenous compounds in biological matrices, termed as Bioanalysis. Solvent extraction such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), derived liquid phase microextraction (LPME) and related approaches such as solid liquid extraction (SLE), proved to be applicable in bioanalysis, as numerous papers have been published in this field. However, their manual performances may suffer from a long-term and laborious preparation, due to the inherent complexity of the biological samples. A high sample-throughput (enabling measurement of tens or hundreds of samples on a daily basis) can be achieved when automation of sample pretreatment is performed, resulting in decreased imprecision and low waste production of hazardous solvents and risky biological materials.

Disease-mongering through clinical trials.,"María González-Moreno, Cristian Saborido, David Teira","Our goal in this paper is to articulate a precise concept of at least a certain kind of disease-mongering, showing how pharmaceutical marketing can commercially exploit certain diseases when their best definition is given through the success of a treatment in a clinical trial. We distinguish two types of disease-mongering according to the way they exploit the definition of the trial population for marketing purposes. We argue that behind these two forms of disease-mongering there are two well-known problems in the statistical methodology of clinical trials (the reference class problem and the distinction between statistical and clinical significance).

[Enhancing of drug bioavailability using liquisolid system formulation].,"Jan Gajdziok, Barbora Vraníková","One of the modern technologies of how to ensure sufficient bioavailability of drugs with limited water solubility is represented by the preparation of liquisolid systems. The functional principle of these formulations is the sorption of a drug in a liquid phase to a porous carrier (aluminometasilicates, microcrystalline cellulose, etc.). After addition of further excipients, in particular a coating material (colloidal silica), a powder is formed with the properties suitable for conversion to conventional solid unit dosage forms for oral administration (tablets, capsules). The drug is subsequently administered to the GIT already in a dissolved state, and moreover, the high surface area of the excipients and their surface hydrophilization by the solvent used, facilitates its contact with and release to the dissolution medium and GI fluids. This technology, due to its ease of preparation, represents an interesting alternative to the currently used methods of bioavailability improvement. The article follows up, by describing the specific aspects influencing the preparation of liquid systems, on the already published papers about the bioavailability of drugs and the possibilities of its technological improvement.Key words: liquisolid systems bioavailability porous carrier coating material preformulation studies.",No date available,Ceska a Slovenska farmacie : casopis Ceske farmaceuticke spolecnosti a Slovenske farmaceuticke spolecnosti,No keywords,"Biological Availability, Capsules, Chemistry, Pharmaceutical, Excipients, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Porosity, Powders, Silicon Dioxide, Solubility, Solvents, Tablets",No DOI available,

The potential of three-dimensional printing for pediatric oral solid dosage forms.,"Klemen Kreft, Marina Fanous, Volker Möckel","Pediatric patients often require individualized dosing of medicine due to their unique pharmacokinetic and developmental characteristics. Current methods for tailoring the dose of pediatric medications, such as tablet splitting or compounding liquid formulations, have limitations in terms of dosing accuracy and palatability. This paper explores the potential of 3D printing as a solution to address the challenges and provide tailored doses of medication for each pediatric patient. The technological overview of 3D printing is discussed, highlighting various 3D printing technologies and their suitability for pharmaceutical applications. Several individualization options with the potential to improve adherence are discussed, such as individualized dosage, custom release kinetics, tablet shape, and palatability. To integrate the preparation of 3D printed medication at the point of care, a decentralized manufacturing model is proposed. In this setup, pharmaceutical companies would routinely provide materials and instructions for 3D printing, while specialized compounding centers or hospital pharmacies perform the printing of medication. In addition, clinical opportunities of 3D printing for dose-finding trials are emphasized.

Drug Contamination of U.S. Paper Currency and Forensic Relevance of Canine Alert to Paper Currency: A Critical Review of the Scientific Literature.,"Jay M Poupko, William Lee Hearn, Federico Rossano","Several studies have reported on wide-spread contamination of U.S. paper currency with cocaine and to a lesser extent other illicit drugs. Canines are trained and employed to search for and alert to drugs. Canine alert to currency has been used as evidence that currency has been directly involved in illicit drug trafficking to justify currency seizure and forfeiture. This assertion, particularly when the only evidence is based upon canine alert, has been challenged in the courts considering that most currency in circulation is contaminated with cocaine. Comprehensive review of the scientific literature establishes that (i) 67-100% of circulated U.S. currency is contaminated with cocaine ranging from a few nanograms to over one milligram/bill (ii) various biological and environmental parameters impact canine alert to drugs.

Love and romantic relationship in the domain of medicine.,Chrysogonus M Okwenna,"In this paper, I explore the nature of medical interventions like neuromodulation on the complex human experience of love. Love is built upon two fundamental natures, viz: the biological and the psychosocial. As a result of this distinction, scientists, and bioethicists have been exploring the possible ways this complex human experience can be biologically tampered with to produce some supposed higher-order ends like well-being and human flourishing. At the forefront in this quest are Earp, Sandberg and Savulescu whose research works over ten years has focused on the good that could stem from the medicalization of love. I acknowledge the various criticisms that have been made against this stance. However, most of these criticisms have been directed towards the mere side effects and sociocultural disservices that could result from the process of using drugs to influence human romantic relationships and in the end, critiques endorse the medicalization of love on the basis that its benefits outweigh the disadvantages. Consequently, I advance two strands of arguments against ""medically-assisted love,"" the ontological and the socio-ethical arguments. The former presupposes that beyond the possible side effects of medicalizing love there is something inherently mistaken about this effort and there is something intrinsically different about love that distinguishes it from its medically-engineered alternative. In the latter argument, I claim that drug interventions in romantic love contravene the very nature of medicine. Overall, I believe that critiques were still able to endorse medicalizing love despite their objections because they were only looking at one direction, the physical/cultural complications.",2022,"Medicine, health care, and philosophy","Biology, Love, Medical interventions, Medicine, Ontology","Humans, Love, Dissent and Disputes, Medicalization, Interpersonal Relations",10.1007/s11019-022-10127-7,"Department of Philosophy, Simon Fraser University, West Mall Centre, 8888 University Dr., Burnaby, BC, V5A 1S6, Canada.

Pharmaceutical approaches for enhancing solubility and oral bioavailability of poorly soluble drugs.,"Isaïe Nyamba, Charles B Sombié, Moussa Yabré, Hermine Zimé-Diawara, Josias Yaméogo, Salfo Ouédraogo, Anna Lechanteur, Rasmané Semdé, Brigitte Evrard","High solubility in water and physiological fluids is an indispensable requirement for the pharmacological efficacy of an active pharmaceutical ingredient. Indeed, it is well established that pharmaceutical substances exhibiting limited solubility in water are inclined towards diminished and inconsistent absorption following oral administration, consequently resulting in variability in therapeutic outcomes. The current advancements in combinatorial chemistry and pharmaceutical design have facilitated the creation of drug candidates characterized by increased lipophilicity, elevated molecular size, and reduced aqueous solubility. Undoubtedly, the issue of poorly water-soluble medications has been progressively escalating over recent years. Indeed, 40% of the top 200 oral medications marketed in the United States, 33% of drugs listed in the US pharmacopoeia, 75% of compounds under development and 90% of new chemical entities are insufficiently water-soluble compounds. In order to address this obstacle, formulation scientists employ a variety of approaches, encompassing both physical and chemical methods such as prodrug synthesis, salt formation, solid dispersions formation, hydrotropic substances utilization, solubilizing agents incorporation, cosolvent addition, polymorphism exploration, cocrystal creation, cyclodextrins complexation, lipid formulations, particle size reduction and nanoformulation techniques. Despite the utilization of these diverse approaches, the primary reason for the failure in new drug development persists as the poor aqueous solubility of pharmaceutical compounds. This paper, therefore, delves into the foundational principles that underpin the implementation of various formulation strategies, along with a discussion on the respective advantages and drawbacks associated with each approach. Additionally, a discourse is provided regarding methodological frameworks for making informed decisions on selecting an appropriate formulation strategy to effectively tackle the key challenges posed during the development of a poorly water-soluble drug candidate.",2024,European journal of pharmaceutics and biopharmaceutics : official journal of Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Pharmazeutische Verfahrenstechnik e.V,"Bioavailability, Dissolution rate, Formulation, Solubility","Solubility, Administration, Oral, Biological Availability, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Humans, Chemistry, Pharmaceutical, Drug Compounding, Water, Animals",10.1016/j.ejpb.2024.114513,"Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Technology and Biopharmacy, CIRM, Université de Liège, 4000 Liège, Belgium; Laboratory of Drug Development, Center of Training, Research and Expertise in Pharmaceutical Sciences (CFOREM), Doctoral School of Sciences and Health, Université Joseph KI-ZERBO, 03 BP 7021 Ouagadougou 03, Burkina Faso; Institut Supérieur des Sciences de la Santé (INSSA), Université Nazi Boni, 01 BP 1091 Bobo-Dioulasso 01, Burkina Faso.

Hyperforin in St. John's wort drug interactions.,"Rajanikanth Madabushi, Bruno Frank, Bernd Drewelow, Hartmut Derendorf, Veronika Butterweck","Recently, interactions of herbal medicines with synthetic drugs came into focus of particular interest. In the past 3 years, more than 50 papers were published regarding interactions between St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum L.; SJW) and prescription drugs. Co-medication with SJW resulted in decreased plasma concentrations of a number of drugs including amitriptyline, cyclosporine, digoxin, indinavir, irinotecan, warfarin, phenprocoumon, alprazolam, dextrometorphane, simvastatin, and oral contraceptives. Sufficient evidence from interaction studies and case reports indicate that SJW is a potent inducer of cytochrome P450 enzymes (particularly CYP3A4) and/or P-glycoprotein. Recent studies could show that the degree of enzyme induction by SJW correlates strongly with the amount of hyperforin found in the product. Products that do not contain substantial amounts of hyperforin (<1%) have not been shown to produce clinically relevant enzyme induction. On the other hand, some evidence suggests that hyperforin may also contribute to the antidepressant activity of SJW. However, clinical studies using SJW preparations with a low hyperforin amount (<1%) clearly demonstrated the superiority of this plant extract over placebo and its equivalence to imipramine and fluoxetine in the treatment of mild to moderate forms of depression.

Embracing and rejecting the medicalization of autism in Italy.,"Alice Scavarda, M Ariel Cascio","Medicalization is increasingly recognized as a bidirectional process, with patients and their families as agents. The paper considers the specific case of the medicalization of autism in Italy, from the point of view of parents of autistic people with different levels of support needs. Through reporting and comparing results of two independently conducted qualitative studies, this paper aims to analyze how parents embrace and resist the medicalization of autism in their everyday lives and in healthcare contexts. Both studies involved participant-observation with services that targeted autistic people and interviews with parents, professionals, and autistic people. Results show that parents of autistic people both embrace and resist medicalization. While parents (sometimes ambivalently) accept the responsibilization inherent in their engagement with interventions (a sort of ""therapeutization"" of life) and reject lay expertise by deferring to experts' knowledge, they also resist the application of medical labels, language and practices in various ways in their everyday lives. Both embracing and resisting medicalization can be useful for achieving overarching social goals of being a good parent, helping their children, and pursuing respect and social harmony. Medicalization derives not only from the cultural dominance of medical discourses, which seems to incorporate resistance to medicalization stances, but also from the absence of continuity and coordination of services, particularly in the Italian context of public (but increasingly privatizing) health and welfare services.",2022,Social science & medicine (1982),"Autism, Biological citizenship, Medicalization, Parents, Somatic expertise","Autistic Disorder, Child, Humans, Language, Medicalization, Parents, Qualitative Research",10.1016/j.socscimed.2022.114728,"Università di Torino, Dipartimento di Culture, Politica e Società, Lungo Dora Siena 100/A, 10153, Torino, Italy.

Packaging analysis of counterfeit medicines.,"Klara Dégardin, Aurélie Guillemain, Philippe Klespe, Florine Hindelang, Raphaël Zurbach, Yves Roggo","The authentication of the packaging represents an important step in the investigation of suspected counterfeits of pharmaceutical products. The visual comparison with a retained sample is the first step to detect a counterfeited packaging. Due to the improvement of technologies like printing, the emergence of counterfeits with a better appearance can be observed. Moreover counterfeits are nowadays often a combination of fake and genuine parts that have been manipulated. Authenticating each part of the product is important in the frame of the investigation to understand how the counterfeiters proceed, and which prevention measures should be taken. Lab instruments like spectrometers can help confirm counterfeits of packaging for packaging components on which visually, no difference with a reference would be observed. In this study several analytical tools were evaluated to help support the authentication of the primary and secondary packaging of one medicinal product as an example using seven reference materials and five counterfeits. In some cases, visual examination of the packaging already enabled to detect counterfeits of the studied features. Also the boxes, leaflets and vials have been analysed with Infrared (IR) spectroscopy, Raman microspectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and microcomputed tomography (microCT).

"The risk of corruption in public pharmaceutical procurement: how anti-corruption, transparency and accountability measures may reduce this risk.","Jillian Clare Kohler, Deirdre Dimancesco","<b>Background</b>: The goal of the public procurement of pharmaceuticals is to purchase sufficient quantities of high-quality pharmaceuticals at cost-effective prices for a given population. This goal can be undercut if corruption infiltrates the procurement process. Good procurement practices can help mitigate the risks of corruption and support equitable access to affordable and high-quality medicines.<b>Objectives</b>: This paper aims to 1) examine manifestations of corruption in the pharmaceutical procurement process and key factors behind them, and 2) identify how to design and implement effective anti-corruption, transparency and accountability mechanisms within this process.<b>Methods</b>: This paper was informed by a narrative literature review from 1996 to the present. The search focused on publications that addressed the issue of pharmaceutical procurement and governance and corruption issues. Our search included peer-reviewed literature, books, grey literature such as working papers, reports published by international organizations and donor agencies, and some media articles. Some documents used in this paper were already known to the authors.<b>Results</b>: Procurement is highly vulnerable to corruption particularly in the health sector. What is more, corruption in the procurement process does not appear to be limited to any one level of government or type of health system. The better integration of accountability, transparency and anti-corruption mechanisms in the procurement process is needed to reduce the risk of corruption.<b>Conclusions</b>: Lessons learned suggest that anti-corruption, transparency and accountability mechanisms in the pharmaceutical procurement process, such as open contracting and integrity pacts are helpful towards reducing the risk of corruption.",No date available,Global health action,"Anti-Corruption, Transparency and Accountability, Procurement practices, accountability, e-procurement, good governance, health, open contracting, transparency","Fraud, Government Programs, Humans, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Social Responsibility",1694745,"Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada., Essential Medicines & Health Products Department, World Health Organization (WHO), Geneva, Switzerland."
Nano-sized crystalline drug production by milling technology.,"Kunikazu Moribe, Keisuke Ueda, Waree Limwikrant, Kenjirou Higashi, Keiji Yamamoto","Nano-formulation of poorly water-soluble drugs has been developed to enhance drug dissolution. In this review, we introduce nano-milling technology described in recently published papers. Factors affecting the size of drug crystals are compared based on the preparation methods and drug and excipient types. A top-down approach using the comminution process is a method conventionally used to prepare crystalline drug nanoparticles. Wet milling using media is well studied and several wet-milled drug formulations are now on the market. Several trials on drug nanosuspension preparation using different apparatuses, materials, and conditions have been reported. Wet milling using a high-pressure homogenizer is another alternative to preparing production-scale drug nanosuspensions. Dry milling is a simple method of preparing a solid-state drug nano-formulation. The effect of size on the dissolution of a drug from nanoparticles is an area of fundamental research, but it is sometimes incorrectly evaluated. Here, we discuss evaluation procedures and the associated problems.

Family Caregiving and the Intergenerational Transmission of Poverty.,Richard L Kaplan,"The United States relies on uncompensated family caregivers to provide most of the long-term care required by older adults as they age. But such care comes at a significant financial cost to these caregivers in the form of lower lifetime earnings and diminished (or even no) Social Security retirement benefits, ineligibility for Medicare coverage of their healthcare costs, and minimal retirement savings. To reduce the impact of uncompensated caregiving on the intergenerational transmission of poverty, this paper discusses three possible mechanisms of compensating family caregivers: public payments, deemed wage credits under Social Security, and income tax incentives.",No date available,"The Journal of law, medicine & ethics : a journal of the American Society of Law, Medicine & Ethics",No keywords,"Caregivers, Family, Financing, Government, Humans, Income Tax, Medicalization, Poverty, Retirement, Social Security, United States",10.1177/1073110518804216,"Richard L.

Materials for microfluidic chip fabrication.,"Kangning Ren, Jianhua Zhou, Hongkai Wu","Through manipulating fluids using microfabricated channel and chamber structures, microfluidics is a powerful tool to realize high sensitive, high speed, high throughput, and low cost analysis. In addition, the method can establish a well-controlled microenivroment for manipulating fluids and particles. It also has rapid growing implementations in both sophisticated chemical/biological analysis and low-cost point-of-care assays. Some unique phenomena emerge at the micrometer scale. For example, reactions are completed in a shorter amount of time as the travel distances of mass and heat are relatively small; the flows are usually laminar; and the capillary effect becomes dominant owing to large surface-to-volume ratios. In the meantime, the surface properties of the device material are greatly amplified, which can lead to either unique functions or problems that we would not encounter at the macroscale. Also, each material inherently corresponds with specific microfabrication strategies and certain native properties of the device. Therefore, the material for making the device plays a dominating role in microfluidic technologies. In this Account, we address the evolution of materials used for fabricating microfluidic chips, and discuss the application-oriented pros and cons of different materials. This Account generally follows the order of the materials introduced to microfluidics. Glass and silicon, the first generation microfluidic device materials, are perfect for capillary electrophoresis and solvent-involved applications but expensive for microfabriaction. Elastomers enable low-cost rapid prototyping and high density integration of valves on chip, allowing complicated and parallel fluid manipulation and in-channel cell culture. Plastics, as competitive alternatives to elastomers, are also rapid and inexpensive to microfabricate. Their broad variety provides flexible choices for different needs. For example, some thermosets support in-situ fabrication of arbitrary 3D structures, while some perfluoropolymers are extremely inert and antifouling. Chemists can use hydrogels as highly permeable structural material, which allows diffusion of molecules without bulk fluid flows. They are used to support 3D cell culture, to form diffusion gradient, and to serve as actuators. Researchers have recently introduced paper-based devices, which are extremely low-cost to prepare and easy to use, thereby promising in commercial point-of-care assays. In general, the evolution of chip materials reflects the two major trends of microfluidic technology: powerful microscale research platforms and low-cost portable analyses. For laboratory research, chemists choosing materials generally need to compromise the ease in prototyping and the performance of the device. However, in commercialization, the major concerns are the cost of production and the ease and reliability in use. There may be new growth in the combination of surface engineering, functional materials, and microfluidics, which is possibly accomplished by the utilization of composite materials or hybrids for advanced device functions. Also, significant expanding of commercial applications can be predicted.",2013,Accounts of chemical research,No keywords,"Hydrogels, Microfluidics, Paper",10.1021/ar300314s,"Department of Chemistry, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology , Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China."

Is Aging a Disease? The Theoretical Definition of Aging in the Light of the Philosophy of Medicine.,"Cristian Saborido, Pablo García-Barranquero","In the philosophical debate on aging, it is common to raise the question of the theoretical definition of aging in terms of its possible characterization as a disease. Understanding aging as a disease seems to imply its medicalization, which has important practical consequences. In this paper, we analyze the question of whether aging is a disease by appealing to the concept of disease in the philosophy of medicine. As a result of this analysis, we argue that a pragmatist approach to the conception of disease is the best alternative to highlight the relevance of the medicalization of aging. From this pragmatist perspective, it can be seen that the notion of aging is going through a conceptual change, and aging can today be understood as a not radically different process from any other condition that is usually considered a disease.",No date available,The Journal of medicine and philosophy,"aging, disease, philosophy of medicine, pragmatism","Humans, Philosophy, Medicalization",10.1093/jmp/jhac030,"UNED, Madrid, Spain., University of Málaga, Málaga, Spain."
Patient Autonomy and Quality of Care in Telehealthcare.,"Giovanni Rubeis, Maximilian Schochow, Florian Steger","Telemedicine is a complex field including various applications and target groups. Especially telehealthcare is seen by many as a means to revolutionize medicine. It gives patients the opportunity to take charge of their own health by using self-tracking devices and allows health professionals to treat patients from a distance. To some, this means an empowerment of patient autonomy as well as an improvement in the quality of care. Others state the dangers of depersonalization of medicine and the pathologization of daily life. This paper examines the ethical implications of telehealthcare, focusing on patient autonomy and quality of care by analyzing metareviews, randomized controlled trials and narrative ethical analyses on the topic. As a result, we conclude that the technically enhanced encounter between patients and health professionals may mean an empowerment of patient autonomy when it goes along with a personal relationship based on trust, assistance and support. When it comes to the quality of care, telehealthcare may lead to an improvement as long it is adopted to the patient's individual needs.",2017,Science and engineering ethics,"Empowerment, Patient autonomy, Quality of care, Telehealthcare, Telemedicine","Activities of Daily Living, Depersonalization, Ethical Analysis, Humans, Medicalization, Personal Autonomy, Power, Psychological, Professional-Patient Relations, Quality of Health Care, Self Care, Telemedicine, Trust",10.1007/s11948-017-9885-3,"Institute of the History, Philosophy and Ethics of Medicine, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany. giovanni.rubeis@uni-ulm.de., Institute of the History, Philosophy and Ethics of Medicine, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany., Institute of the History, Philosophy and Ethics of Medicine, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany."

Detection and quantitation of synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists in infused papers from prisons in a constantly evolving illicit market.,"Caitlyn Norman, Gillian Walker, Brian McKirdy, Ciara McDonald, Daniel Fletcher, Lysbeth H Antonides, Oliver B Sutcliffe, Niamh Nic Daéid, Craig McKenzie","Drug misuse in prisons contributes to increased disruption and violence and negatively impacts prisoner safety, rehabilitation, and recovery. Synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists (SCRAs), colloquially known as ""spice"", are infused into papers and are of particular concern in a prison setting where they are commonly vaped. Methods for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of SCRA infused papers, including impurity profiling, were developed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) with qualitative confirmation by ultra high pressure liquid chromatography with photodiode array and quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry detection (UPLC-PDA-QToF-MS) and applied to 354 individual seized paper samples originating from 168 seizures from three Scottish prisons. Of these samples, 41% (146 samples from 101 seizures) contained at least one SCRA and multiple SCRAs were detected on 23% of these papers. Concentrations ranged from < 0.05-1.17 mg/cm<sup>2</sup> paper, representing the first reported quantitative data for SCRA infused papers. An evolution in the SCRAs detected was demonstrated; 5F-MDMB-PINACA (5F-ADB) predominated until late 2018, after which time 5F-MDMB-PICA and 4F-MDMB-BINACA became increasingly more prevalent, followed by the arrival of MDMB-4en-PINACA in June 2019. Concentration mapping data from two seized paper samples demonstrated that SCRA concentrations across larger papers were highly variable (0.47-2.38 mg/cm<sup>2</sup> paper) making consistent dosing by users, and representative sampling by laboratory analysts, difficult.

Improving Medication Dosing in the Obese Patient.,Brian L Erstad,"The purpose of this paper is to provide clinicians with important considerations and caveats when evaluating published literature on medication dosing in obese subjects, since much of this literature involves short-term pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic studies that are not designed to look at clinically important outcomes. A secondary objective is to suggest improvements in the reporting of dosing information derived from clinical studies and incorporated into product information labeling that should help clinicians design medication-specific dosing regimens for patients with obesity. Data sources included published studies, review papers, and clinical practice guidelines concerning drug dosing of subjects with obesity. Medication dosing recommendations in product labeling typically are derived from studies of normal healthy volunteers and patients with single-system disease states or patients in a specialized setting (e.g. operating room, intensive care unit). Even in studies with relatively large sample sizes there are often relatively few subjects with extremes of body composition such as patients with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, so the appropriateness of labeled dosing information for these subjects is particularly ill-defined. Investigations of medication labeling information have demonstrated the inadequacy of this information for dosing patients of more extreme body size. Clinical investigations of drugs should be designed and the results reported in a manner that allows for meaningful recommendations for drug dosing in patients with varying degrees of obesity. Until and when such studies are routinely performed, there are steps that can be taken by the pharmaceutical industry, clinicians, and governmental agencies to help insure optimal drug dosing in obesity.",No date available,Clinical drug investigation,No keywords,"Body Composition, Body Mass Index, Humans, Obesity, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Product Labeling",10.1007/s40261-016-0461-4,"Department of Pharmacy Practice and Science, College of Pharmacy, University of Arizona, 1295 N.

Medicalising the menace? The symbiotic convergence of medicine and law enforcement in the medicalisation of marijuana in Minnesota.,Ryan T Steel,"The medicalisation of marijuana has occurred rapidly, albeit nonuniformly, across the US and around the world over the past 3 decades. This paper centres on the medicalisation of marijuana in Minnesota-which has one of the most restrictive programs in the country-as a case for evaluating the negotiation of institutional boundaries with the shift from criminalisation to medicalisation after nearly a century of criminal prohibition. Drawing upon Foucauldian discourse analyses of the medical and law enforcement associations' position statements and legislative hearings that shaped medical marijuana policy in Minnesota, this paper demonstrates a symbiotic convergence between medicine and law enforcement through the deployment of shared discursive strategies in their opposition to medical marijuana that reinforce marijuana's criminalised status by solidifying the boundaries between proper medicine and dangerous drugs. Criminal justice and medical institutions draw upon one another's definitions, logics, and practices in a mutually constitutive manner, while still maintaining distinct user subjects and institutional interventions for each based on the user's access to state-approved forms of marijuana. The consequences for the governing of marijuana in Minnesota are explored, as well as the broader implications for the sociological study of medicalisation and criminalisation with respect to the governance of drugs and health.",2022,Sociology of health & illness,"criminalisation, discourse analysis, governance, institutional boundaries, medical marijuana","Cannabis, Humans, Law Enforcement, Medical Marijuana, Medicalization, Minnesota",10.1111/1467-9566.13513,"Department of Sociology and Anthropology, University of Richmond, Richmond, Virginia, USA."

Is premenstrual dysphoric disorder really a disorder?,Tamara Kayali Browne,"Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) was recently moved to a full category in the DSM-5 (the latest edition of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders). It also appears set for inclusion as a separate disorder in the ICD-11 (the upcoming edition of the World Health Organization's International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems). This paper argues that PMDD should not be listed in the DSM or the ICD at all, adding to the call to recognise PMDD as a socially constructed disorder. I first present the argument that PMDD pathologises understandable anger/distress and that to do so is potentially dangerous. I then present evidence that PMDD is a culture-bound phenomenon, not a universal one. I also argue that even if (1) medication produces a desired effect, (2) there are biological correlates with premenstrual anger/distress, (3) such anger/distress seems to occur monthly, and (4) women are more likely than men to be diagnosed with affective disorders, none of these factors substantiates that premenstrual anger/distress is caused by a mental disorder. I argue that to assume they do is to ignore the now accepted role that one's environment and psychology play in illness development, as well as arguments concerning the social construction of mental illness. In doing so, I do not claim that there are no women who experience premenstrual distress or that their distress is not a lived experience. My point is that such distress can be recognised and considered significant without being pathologised and that it is unethical to describe premenstrual anger/distress as a mental disorder. Further, if the credibility of women's suffering is subject to doubt without a clinical diagnosis, then the way to address this problem is to change societal attitudes towards women's suffering, not to label women as mentally ill. The paper concludes with some broader implications for women and society of the change in status of PMDD in the DSM-5 as well as a sketch of critical policy suggestions to address these implications.",2014,Journal of bioethical inquiry,No keywords,"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Female, Humans, Medicalization, Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder",10.1007/s11673-014-9567-7,"Biology Teaching and Learning Centre, Research School of Biology, The Australian National University, R.N.

Prescriptions and proscriptions: moralising sleep medicines.,"Jonathan Gabe, Catherine M Coveney, Simon J Williams","The pharmaceuticalisation of sleep is a contentious issue. Sleep medicines get a 'bad press' due to their potential for dependence and other side effects, including studies reporting increased mortality risks for long-term users. Yet relatively little qualitative social science research has been conducted into how people understand and negotiate their use/non-use of sleep medicines in the context of their everyday lives. This paper draws on focus group data collected in the UK to elicit collective views on and experiences of prescription hypnotics across different social contexts. Respondents, we show, drew on a range of moral repertoires which allowed them to present themselves and their relationships with hypnotics in different ways. Six distinct repertoires about hypnotic use are identified in this regard: the 'deserving' patient, the 'responsible' user, the 'compliant' patient, the 'addict', the 'sinful' user and the 'noble' non user. These users and non-users are constructed drawing on cross-cutting themes of addiction and control, ambivalence and reflexivity. Such issues are in turn discussed in relation to recent sociological debates on the pharmaceuticalisation/de-pharmaceuticalisation of everyday life and the consumption of medicines in the UK today.",2015,Sociology of health & illness,"drugs/medication, UK, pharmaceuticals/pharmaceutical companies, sleep","Adult, Female, Focus Groups, Humans, Hypnotics and Sedatives, Male, Medicalization, Middle Aged, Morals, Prescription Drugs, Qualitative Research, Sleep, United Kingdom",10.1111/1467-9566.12383,"Centre for Criminology & Sociology, Royal Holloway, University of London., Centre for Global Health Policy, University of Sussex., Department of Sociology, University of Warwick."

One of the key issues addressed has been the need for the electronic system to integrate with the paper record. This need to function in the dual electronic/paper environment has placed new demands on printers, required revision of some paper forms, and required the electronic system to create facsimilies of paper record forms.

Transgender medicalization and the attempt to evade psychological distress.,Robert Withers,"In this paper the author argues that trans-identification and its associated medical treatment can constitute an attempt to evade experiences of psychological distress. This occurs on three levels. Firstly, the trans person themselves may seek to evade dysregulated affects associated with such experiences as attachment trauma, childhood abuse, and ego-alien sexual feelings. Secondly, therapists may attempt to evade feelings, such as fear and hatred, evoked by engaging with these dysregulated affects. Thirdly, we, as a society, may wish to evade acknowledging the reality of such trauma, abuse and sexual distress by hypothesizing that trans-identification is a biological issue, best treated medically. The author argues that the quality of evidence supporting the biomedical approach is extremely poor. This puts young trans people at risk of receiving potentially damaging medical treatment they may later seek to reverse or come to regret, while their underlying psychological issues remain unaddressed.",No date available,The Journal of analytical psychology,"Beziehungstrauma, Detransition, Dissoziation, Gegenübertragung, Geschlechtsdysphorie (GD), affect dérégulé, affetti alterati, attachment trauma, contratransferencia, contretransfert, controtransfert, countertransference, detransición, detransition, detransizione, disforia de género (GD), disforia di genere (DIG), disociación, dissociation, dissociazione, dysphorie de genre, dysregulated affect, dysregulierter Affekt, dé-transition, emoción desregulada, gender dysphoria (GD), homofobia internalizada, homophobie internalisée, internalised homophobia, internalisierte Homophobie, omofobia interiorizzata, transgender, transgenre, transgénero, trauma de apego, trauma dell’attaccamento, traumatisme de l’attachement, гендерная дисфория (GD), детрансформация, дисрегулируемый аффект, диссоциация, интернализованная гомофобия, контрперенос, травма привязанности, трансгендер, 依恋创伤, 内化恐同, 去性别转换, 反移情, 失调的情绪, 性别焦虑症 (GD), 跨性别, 隔离","Female, Humans, Male, Medicalization, Psychological Distress, Transgender Persons, Transsexualism",10.1111/1468-5922.12641,Brighton.
Transforming Patient Compliance Research in an Era of Biomedicalization.,Karen Lutfey Spencer,"The term patient noncompliance emerged in the 1970s as a tool for analyzing why people do not follow medical directives. Despite its early popularity, the term has languished in sociology while flourishing in biomedical arenas. It seems flaccid in a contemporary healthcare context as it overestimates physician authority and is tone-deaf to biomedicalization. I draw from sociological and anthropological traditions, as well as qualitative interviews with terminally ill patients ( N = 26) and their caregivers ( N = 16), to consider facets of a biomedicalized health experience and implications for an updated vision of compliance. First, pathways to care have proliferated under biomedicalization. With increased pathways comes increased need for understanding how treatment plans are socially constituted and assessed. Finally, increased complexity demands a more diverse vocabulary for understanding health related decisions.

Mindfulness meditation: do-it-yourself medicalization of every moment.,Kristin K Barker,"This paper examines mindfulness as a popular and paradigmatic alternative healing practice within the context of contemporary medicalization trends. In recognition of the increasingly influential role popular media play in shaping ideas about illness and healing, what follows is a discursive analysis of bestselling mindfulness meditation self-help books and audio recordings by Jon Kabat-Zinn. The central and contradictory elements of this do-it-yourself healing practice as presented in these materials are best understood as aligned with medicalization trends for three principal reasons. First, mindfulness represents a significant expansion in the definition of disease beyond that advanced by mainstream medicine. Second, its etiological model intensifies the need for therapeutic surveillance and intervention. Third, by defining healing as a never-ending process, it permanently locates individuals within a disease-therapy cycle. In sum, the definition, cause, and treatment of disease as articulated by popular mindfulness resources expands the terrain of experiences and problems that are mediated by medical concepts.

Large-scale evaluation of ion mobility spectrometry for the rapid detection of synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists in infused papers in prisons.,"Caitlyn Norman, Brian McKirdy, Gillian Walker, Pat Dugard, Niamh NicDaéid, Craig McKenzie","Synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists (SCRAs), colloquially known as ""spice,"" are commonly used in prisons and enter establishments via the mail in the form of infused papers. Many prisons use benchtop ion mobility spectroscopy (IMS) instruments to screen mail and seized materials for the presence of SCRAs and other controlled substances. The selectivity and sensitivity of Rapiscan Itemiser<sup>®</sup> 3E and Itemiser<sup>®</sup> 4DN Ion Trap Mobility Spectroscopy™ (ITMS™) systems were evaluated using 21 SCRA reference standards. Some differences in the SCRA reduced mobility (K<sub>0</sub> ) values were observed between this study and those reported previously using IMS detection systems, particularly for cumyl and quinolinyl SCRAs (e.g., 5F-PB-22, Cumyl-4CN-BINACA, and 5F-Cumyl-PEGACLONE), although this was found to have little effect at an operational level. Operational reliability of the systems was evaluated by analyzing 392 paper and card samples with known drug content. ITMS™ system results (e.g., detect or nondetect) were in agreement with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis in up to 95% of samples tested. Overall, this study found the ITMS™ systems tested to be effective instruments when deployed for the rapid detection of SCRA-infused papers. Used effectively and with up-to-date substance libraries, they will help reduce the supply of SCRAs into prisons and identify emerging threats as they arise. Several emerging SCRAs (5F-MPP-PICA, 5F-EMB-PICA, and 4F-MDMB-BICA) were detected for the first time in Scottish prisons between May and August 2020 as a result of routine monitoring, and all were detected using the ITMS™ systems tested.",2021,Drug testing and analysis,"forensic chemistry, ion mobility spectrometry, new psychoactive substances, prison, synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists","Cannabinoid Receptor Agonists, Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry, Humans, Illicit Drugs, Ion Mobility Spectrometry, Paper, Prisons, Reproducibility of Results, Scotland",10.1002/dta.2945,"Leverhulme Research Centre for Forensic Science, School of Science and Engineering, University of Dundee, Dundee, UK., HMP Inverness, Scottish Prison Service, Inverness, UK., Public Protection Unit, Scottish Prison Service, Edinburgh, UK., Leverhulme Research Centre for Forensic Science, School of Science and Engineering, University of Dundee, Dundee, UK., Leverhulme Research Centre for Forensic Science, School of Science and Engineering, University of Dundee, Dundee, UK., Leverhulme Research Centre for Forensic Science, School of Science and Engineering, University of Dundee, Dundee, UK."

Medication-related clinical decision support in computerized provider order entry systems: a review.,"Gilad J Kuperman, Anne Bobb, Thomas H Payne, Anthony J Avery, Tejal K Gandhi, Gerard Burns, David C Classen, David W Bates","While medications can improve patients' health, the process of prescribing them is complex and error prone, and medication errors cause many preventable injuries. Computer provider order entry (CPOE) with clinical decision support (CDS), can improve patient safety and lower medication-related costs. To realize the medication-related benefits of CDS within CPOE, one must overcome significant challenges. Healthcare organizations implementing CPOE must understand what classes of CDS their CPOE systems can support, assure that clinical knowledge underlying their CDS systems is reasonable, and appropriately represent electronic patient data. These issues often influence to what extent an institution will succeed with its CPOE implementation and achieve its desired goals. Medication-related decision support is probably best introduced into healthcare organizations in two stages, basic and advanced. Basic decision support includes drug-allergy checking, basic dosing guidance, formulary decision support, duplicate therapy checking, and drug-drug interaction checking. Advanced decision support includes dosing support for renal insufficiency and geriatric patients, guidance for medication-related laboratory testing, drug-pregnancy checking, and drug-disease contraindication checking. In this paper, the authors outline some of the challenges associated with both basic and advanced decision support and discuss how those challenges might be addressed.

[The psychiatrization and unpredictability of interpersonal violent behavior].,"Alessandra M A Nivoli, Paolo Milia, Cristiano Depalmas, Giancarlo Nivoli, Massimo Biondi, Giulia Taras, Liliana Lorettu","The relationship between mental illness and violent behavior is a complex phenomenon. Scientific literature indicates that the presence of a mental disorder, even severe, is not sufficient, alone, to predict or motivate violent behavior, which seems to be more associated with other intermediate variables. The phenomenon of psychiatrization of violent behavior can be defined, from a psychiatric-forensic point of view, as the prejudicial and erroneous attribution to mental illness as a causal factor in relation to violent behavior. This phenomenon has consequences in psychiatric clinical practice, but also at the level of social stigmatization, management of organizational and economic resources, and the judicial system. In this paper, clinical criticalities related to the psychiatrization of violent behavior will be analyzed, including the need to differentiate clinical etiology and legal causality, predictability and avoidability, protective clinical factors and clinical risk factors, the limits of categorical psychiatric diagnosis, the need for specific victimological information, the criticalities of pharmacotherapy. Some forensic criticalities will also be analyzed, including errors in clinical and forensic methodology (psychiatrization of the symptom, prejudicial contamination, diagnostic overshadowing, legal causalization of protective and risk factors, the use of categorical diagnosis in the forensic field, the psychiatrization of non-pathological human experiences, the criminalization of the subject with mental disorder). In conclusion, it is highlighted that an individual can have a psychic disorder, even severe, but this disorder is not necessarily in a causal relationship with violent behavior. The lack of a causal relationship makes predictability of violent behavior difficult, even impossible depending on the case, both in the general population and in individuals with psychiatric disorders.",No date available,Rivista di psichiatria,No keywords,"Dangerous Behavior, Forensic Psychiatry, Humans, Interpersonal Relations, Medicalization, Mental Disorders, Risk Factors, Substance-Related Disorders, Violence",10.1708/3504.34905,"Clinica Psichiatrica, Dipartimento di Scienze Mediche, Chirurgiche e Sperimentali, Università degli studi di Sassari, AOU-Sassari., Clinica Psichiatrica, Dipartimento di Scienze Mediche, Chirurgiche e Sperimentali, Università degli studi di Sassari, AOU-Sassari., Clinica Psichiatrica, Dipartimento di Scienze Mediche, Chirurgiche e Sperimentali, Università degli studi di Sassari, AOU-Sassari., Dipartimento di Neuroscienze Umane, Sapienza Università di Roma., Clinica Psichiatrica, Dipartimento di Scienze Mediche, Chirurgiche e Sperimentali, Università degli studi di Sassari, AOU-Sassari., Clinica Psichiatrica, Dipartimento di Scienze Mediche, Chirurgiche e Sperimentali, Università degli studi di Sassari, AOU-Sassari."
Paper waste and carbon emissions from oral contraceptive leaflets.,"Myriam Safrai, Dana Elly, Noah Gruber, Benjamin Stern, Doron Kabiri, Moran Shapira","Oral contraceptives (OC) are the most used form of contraception among women in the U.S. and Europe. Like other medications, their packaging must include patient information leaflets. This study quantifies the environmental impact of paper waste generated by these leaflets.

On average, leaflets accounted for 55% of the package weight, while pills and blister dispensers represented only 32%. The mean weight of OC leaflets was 12.3 ± 5.5 grams (4.7-21.9 grams), leading to an estimated annual paper waste of 6,118.4 tons, 5,763.5 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions, and the use of approximately 146,841 trees for production. Standardizing leaflet weight to the lightest reported can reduce annual waste by 3780.5 tons of paper.

A total of 117 articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria, including 251 comparisons. Most frequent comparisons were against self-report (n = 119) and pill count (n = 59). Similar outcome measures were used in 210 comparisons (84%), among which 78 used dichotomous variables (adherent or not) and 132 used continuous measures (adherence expressed as percentage). Furthermore, 32% of all comparisons did not estimate adherence over the same coverage period and 44% of all comparisons did not use a statistical method or used a suboptimal one. Only eighty-seven (35%) comparisons had similar coverage periods, similar outcome measures and optimal statistical methods. Compared to MEMS, median adherence was grossly overestimated by 17% using self-report, by 8% using pill count and by 6% using rating. In conclusion, among all comparisons of MEMS versus alternative methods for measuring adherence, only a few used adequate comparisons in terms of outcome measures, coverage periods and statistical method. Researchers should therefore use stronger methodological frameworks when comparing measurement methods and be aware that non-electronic measures could lead to overestimation of medication adherence.",2016,British journal of clinical pharmacology,"measurement methods, medication adherence, medication event monitoring system, methodology, pill count, self-report","Data Interpretation, Statistical, Drug Packaging, Humans, Medication Adherence, Outcome Assessment, Health Care, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Self Report",10.1111/bcp.12942,"Department of Health Services Research, CAPHRI School for Public Health and Primary Care, Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands., WestRock Healthcare, Visé, Belgium., WestRock Healthcare, Visé, Belgium., Department of Health Services Research, CAPHRI School for Public Health and Primary Care, Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands., Department of Health Services Research, CAPHRI School for Public Health and Primary Care, Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands."
Shape matters: The application of activity-based in vitro bioassays and chiral profiling to the pharmacological evaluation of synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists in drug-infused papers seized in prisons.,"Lysbeth H Antonides, Annelies Cannaert, Caitlyn Norman, Niamh NicDáeid, Oliver B Sutcliffe, Christophe P Stove, Craig McKenzie","Synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists (SCRAs) elicit many of their psychoactive effects via type-1 human cannabinoid (CB<sub>1</sub> ) receptors. Enantiomer pairs of eight tert-leucinate or valinate indole- and indazole-3-carboxamide SCRAs were synthesized and their CB<sub>1</sub> potency and efficacy assessed using an in vitro β-arrestin recruitment assay in a HEK239T stable cell system. A chiral high-performance liquid chromatography method with photodiode array and/or quadrupole time-of-flight-mass spectrometry detection (HPLC-PDA and HPLC-PDA-QToF-MS) was applied to 177 SCRA-infused paper samples seized in Scottish prisons between 2018 and 2020. In most samples, SCRAs were almost enantiopure (S)-enantiomer (>98% of total chromatographic peak area), although in some (n = 18), 2% to 16% of the (R)-enantiomer was detected. (S)-enantiomers are consistently more potent than (R)-enantiomers and often more efficacious. The importance of SCRA-CB<sub>1</sub> receptor interactions in the ""head"" or ""linked group"" moiety is demonstrated, with the conformation of the ""bulky"" tert-leucinate group greatly affecting potency (by up to a factor of 374), significantly greater than the difference observed between valinate SCRA enantiomers. (S)-MDMB-4en-PINACA, (S)-4F-MDMB-BINACA, and (S)-5F-MDMB-PICA are currently the most prevalent SCRAs in Scottish prisons, and all have similar high potency (EC<sub>50</sub> , 1-5 nM) and efficacy. Infused paper samples were compared using estimated intrinsic efficacy at the CB<sub>1</sub> receptor (EIE<sub>CB1</sub> ) to evaluate samples with variable SCRA content. Given their similar potency and efficacy, any variation in CB<sub>1</sub> receptor-mediated psychoactive effects are likely to derive from variation in dose, mode of use, pharmacokinetic differences, and individual factors affecting the user, rather than differences in the specific SCRA present.",2020,Drug testing and analysis,"activity-based bioassay, chiral profiling, new psychoactive substances, prisons, synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists","Biological Assay, Cannabinoid Receptor Agonists, Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid, HEK293 Cells, Humans, Illicit Drugs, Mass Spectrometry, Paper, Prisons, Scotland, Stereoisomerism, beta-Arrestins",10.1002/dta.2965,"Leverhulme Research Centre for Forensic Science, School of Science and Engineering, University of Dundee, Dundee, UK., Laboratory of Toxicology, Department of Bioanalysis, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium., Leverhulme Research Centre for Forensic Science, School of Science and Engineering, University of Dundee, Dundee, UK., Leverhulme Research Centre for Forensic Science, School of Science and Engineering, University of Dundee, Dundee, UK., Department of Natural Sciences, Manchester Metropolitan University, Manchester, UK., Laboratory of Toxicology, Department of Bioanalysis, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium., Leverhulme Research Centre for Forensic Science, School of Science and Engineering, University of Dundee, Dundee, UK."

Can nasal drug delivery bypass the blood-brain barrier?: questioning the direct transport theory.,"Frans W H M Merkus, Mascha P van den Berg","The connection between the nasal cavity and the CNS by the olfactory neurones has been investigated extensively during the last decades with regard to its feasibility to serve as a direct drug transport route to the CSF and brain. This drug transport route has gained much interest as it may circumvent the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which prevents some drugs from entering the brain. Approximately 100 published papers mainly reporting animal experiments were reviewed to evaluate whether the experimental design used and the results generated provided adequate pharmacokinetic information to assess whether the investigated drug was transported directly from the olfactory area to the CNS. In the analysis the large anatomical differences between the olfactory areas of animals and humans and the experimental conditions used were evaluated. The aim of this paper was to establish the actual evidence for the feasibility of this direct transport route in humans. Twelve papers presented a sound experimental design to study direct nose to CNS transport of drugs based on the authors' criteria. Of these, only two studies in rats were able to provide results that can be seen as an indication for direct transport from the nose to the CNS. No pharmacokinetic evidence could be found to support a claim that nasal administration of drugs in humans will result in an enhanced delivery to their target sites in the brain compared with intravenous administration of the same drug under similar dosage conditions.",No date available,Drugs in R&D,No keywords,"Administration, Intranasal, Animals, Biological Transport, Blood-Brain Barrier, Brain, Drug Delivery Systems, Humans, Nasal Mucosa, Nose, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Pharmacokinetics, Rats",No DOI available,"Leiden/Amsterdam Centre for Drug Research, Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands.

Harm reduction and self-managed abortion appear in the professional literature largely as evidenced-based public health strategies, more than as social movements. However, each began at the margins of the law as a form of direct action developed by activists anchored in social justice movements and working in community contexts independent of both state and institutional control according to a human rights perspective of bodily integrity and autonomy. An analysis of the history and dynamics of harm reduction and self-managed abortion as social movements underlies the proposed framework of autonomous health movements, and additional potential examples of such movements are identified. The framework of autonomous health movements opens up new pathways for thinking about the development of autonomous, community-based health strategies under conditions of marginalization and criminalization.",No date available,Health and human rights,No keywords,"Abortion, Induced, Community Participation, Female, Human Rights, Humans, Medicalization, Pregnancy, Social Justice, United States",No DOI available,"Sociologist and Professor at Brooklyn College, City University of New York, USA."
Impact of Porous Matrices and Concentration by Lyophilization on Cell-Free Expression.,"Steven M Blum, Marilyn S Lee, Glory E Mgboji, Vanessa L Funk, Kathryn Beabout, Svetlana V Harbaugh, Pierce A Roth, Alvin T Liem, Aleksandr E Miklos, Peter A Emanuel, Scott A Walper, Jorge Luis Chávez, Matthew W Lux","Cell-free expression systems have drawn increasing attention as a tool to achieve complex biological functions outside of the cell. Several applications of the technology involve the delivery of functionality to challenging environments, such as field-forward diagnostics or point-of-need manufacturing of pharmaceuticals. To achieve these goals, cell-free reaction components are preserved using encapsulation or lyophilization methods, both of which often involve an embedding of components in porous matrices like paper or hydrogels. Previous work has shown a range of impacts of porous materials on cell-free expression reactions. Here, we explored a panel of 32 paperlike materials and 5 hydrogel materials for the impact on reaction performance. The screen included a tolerance to lyophilization for reaction systems based on both cell lysates and purified expression components. For paperlike materials, we found that (1) materials based on synthetic polymers were mostly incompatible with cell-free expression, (2) lysate-based reactions were largely insensitive to the matrix for cellulosic and microfiber materials, and (3) purified systems had an improved performance when lyophilized in cellulosic but not microfiber matrices. The impact of hydrogel materials ranged from completely inhibitory to a slight enhancement. The exploration of modulating the rehydration volume of lyophilized reactions yielded reaction speed increases using an enzymatic colorimetric reporter of up to twofold with an optimal ratio of 2:1 lyophilized reaction to rehydration volume for the lysate system and 1.5:1 for the purified system. The effect was independent of the matrices assessed. Testing with a fluorescent nonenzymatic reporter and no matrix showed similar improvements in both yields and reaction speeds for the lysate system and yields but not reaction speeds for the purified system. We finally used these observations to show an improved performance of two sensors that span reaction types, matrix, and reporters.

Medicalizing to demedicalize: lactation consultants and the (de)medicalization of breastfeeding.,Jennifer M C Torres,"This paper uses the domain of breastfeeding in the U.S. and the work of International Board Certified Lactation Consultants to refine the concept of medicalization-demedicalization. Given lactation consultants' origins and current role in maternity care, they provide a unique lens on these processes because they are positioned at the crossroads of medicalization and demedicalization. Using 150 h of ethnographic observation and 39 interviews conducted between 2008 and 2012, I identify aspects of medicalization-demedicalization in the work of lactation consultants according to four dimensions: medical definition, medical control, pathology, and medical technology. Lactation consultants work to demedicalize breastfeeding by challenging the construction of breastfeeding pathology and limiting intervention. At the same time, they hold a position of medical control and medicalize breastfeeding by reinforcing a medical definition and using medical technology to treat breastfeeding problems. However, lactation consultants are not only working toward demedicalization and medicalization simultaneously, but are also medicalizing to demedicalize. Their position of medical control over breastfeeding provides them with a certain measure of authority that they can use in their efforts to depathologize breastfeeding and limit medical intervention. These findings build upon previous research that has identified cases of medicalization and demedicalization occurring simultaneously and draw attention to the need for an understanding of medicalization-demedicalization as a continuous process. Furthermore, the concept of ""medicalizing to demedicalize"" provides a novel contribution to the literature.",2013,Social science & medicine (1982),"Breastfeeding, Demedicalization, Ethnography, Medicalization, USA","Anthropology, Cultural, Breast Feeding, Consultants, Female, Humans, Infant, Lactation, Medicalization, Qualitative Research, United States",10.1016/j.socscimed.2013.11.013,"University of Michigan, 3001 LSA Building, 500 S.

The politics of health sector reform in developing countries: three cases of pharmaceutical policy.,M R Reich,"This paper examines the political dynamics of health sector reform in poor countries, through a comparative study of pharmaceutical policy reform in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and the Philippines. The paper first reviews five reasons why policy reform is political. It then presents three political economic models of the policy reform process: the political will, political factions, and political survival models. Next, the paper describes the three cases of national pharmaceutical policy reform, and identifies common conditions that made these reforms politically feasible. The paper's analysis suggests that health sector reform is feasible at certain definable, and perhaps predictable, political moments, especially in the early periods of new regimes. The most important and manipulable political factors are: political timing, which provides opportunities for policy entrepreneurs to introduce their ideas into public debate, and political management of group competition, which allows leaders to control the political effects of distributional consequences and protect the regime's stability. A strong and narrow political coalition improves the capacity of political leaders to resist the pressures of concentrated economic costs (both inside and outside national boundaries). The paper argues that for reform to succeed, policy-makers need effective methods to analyze relevant political conditions and shape key political factors in favor of policy reform. The method of Political Mapping is briefly introduced as a technique that can help policy-makers in analyzing and managing the political dimensions of policy reform and in improving the political feasibility of reform.",No date available,"Health policy (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",No keywords,"Bangladesh, Developing Countries, Economic Competition, Economics, Pharmaceutical, Health Care Reform, Legislation, Pharmacy, Models, Organizational, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Philippines, Poverty, Sri Lanka",No DOI available,"Harvard University School of Public Health, Boston, MA 02115, USA."

Rapid detection of NBOME's and other NPS on blotter papers by direct ATR-FTIR spectrometry.,José Coelho Neto,"Blotter paper is among the most common forms of consumption of new psychotropic substances (NPS), formerly referred as designer drugs. In many cases, users are misled to believe they are taking LSD when, in fact, they are taking newer and less known drugs like the NBOMEs or other substituted phenethylamines. We report our findings in quick testing of blotter papers for illicit substances like NBOMEs and other NPS by taking ATR-FTIR spectra directly from blotters seized on the streets, without any sample preparation. Both sides (front and back) of each blotter were tested. Collected data were analyzed by single- and multi-component spectral matching and submitted to chemometric discriminant analysis. Our results showed that, on 66.7% of the cases analyzed, seized blotters contained one or more types of NBOMEs, confirming the growing presence of this novel substances on the market. Matching IR signals were detected on both or just one side of the blotters and showed variable strength. Although no quantitative analysis was made, detection of these substances by the proposed approach serves as indication of variable and possibly higher dosages per blotter when compared to LSD, which showed to be below the detection limit of the applied method. Blotters containing a mescaline-like compound, later confirmed by GC-MS and LC-MS to be MAL (methallylescaline), a substance very similar to mescaline, were detected among the samples tested.

Paper-Based Enzyme Competition Assay for Detecting Falsified β-Lactam Antibiotics.,"Katherine E Boehle, Cody S Carrell, Joseph Caraway, Charles S Henry","Falsified and substandard antibiotics are a growing worldwide problem that leads to increased patient mortality and decreased trust in healthcare, and contributes to antimicrobial resistance. Monitoring falsified antibiotics is difficult because most falsified pharmaceuticals are most commonly found in developing countries, where detecting the active ingredient is difficult due to lack of access to complex instrumentation. Herein, we describe the development and optimization of a microfluidic paper-based analytical device (μPAD) to detect the active ingredient in the most falsified class of antibiotics, β-lactams. The assay is based on enzyme competition, making it the first demonstrated competitive enzyme assay reported in paper-based devices. The assay uses nitrocefin, a chromogenic substrate, to compete with β-lactam antibiotics in a reaction with β-lactamase. A yellow color indicates legitimate drugs, while a color change from yellow to red indicates falsified drugs. In addition to testing for the active ingredient, another section of the device was added to test the sample pH to further verify results and identify common falsified ingredients like aspirin or baking soda. Calibration curves for four different antibiotics, including cefazolin, have been generated making it the first paper-based device capable of detecting both cephalosporin and penicillin antibiotics.

"A Comprehensive Review on Niosomes as a Strategy in Targeted Drug Delivery: Pharmaceutical, and Herbal Cosmetic Applications.","Sakshi Saharawat, Sushma Verma","Niosomes are newly developed, self-assembling sac-like transporters that deliver medication at a specific site in a focused manner, increasing availability in the body and prolonging healing effects. Niosome discovery has increased drugs' therapeutic effectiveness while also reducing adverse effects. This article aims to concentrate on the increase in the worldwide utilization of niosomal formulation. This overview presents a thorough perspective of niosomal investigation up until now, encompassing categories and production techniques, their significance in pharmaceutical transportation, and cosmetic use. The thorough literature review revealed that extensive attention has been given to developing nanocarriers for drug delivery as they hold immense endeavor to attain targeted delivery to the affected area simultaneously shielding the adjacent healthy tissue. Many reviews and research papers have been published that demonstrate the interest of scientists in niosomes. Phytoconstituents, which possess antioxidant, antibiotic, anti-inflammatory, wound healing, anti-acne, and skin whitening properties, are also encapsulated into niosome. Their flexibility allows for the incorporation of various therapeutic agents, including small molecules, proteins, and peptides making them adaptable for different types of drugs. Niosomes can be modified with ligands, enhancing their targeting capabilities.

Could Moral Enhancement Interventions be Medically Indicated?,Sarah Carter,"This paper explores the position that moral enhancement interventions could be medically indicated (and so considered therapeutic) in cases where they provide a remedy for a lack of empathy, when such a deficit is considered pathological. In order to argue this claim, the question as to whether a deficit of empathy could be considered to be pathological is examined, taking into account the difficulty of defining illness and disorder generally, and especially in the case of mental health. Following this, Psychopathy and a fictionalised mental disorder (Moral Deficiency Disorder) are explored with a view to consider moral enhancement techniques as possible treatments for both conditions. At this juncture, having asserted and defended the position that moral enhancement interventions could, under certain circumstances, be considered medically indicated, this paper then goes on to briefly explore some of the consequences of this assertion. First, it is acknowledged that this broadening of diagnostic criteria in light of new interventions could fall foul of claims of medicalisation. It is then briefly noted that considering moral enhancement technologies to be akin to therapies in certain circumstances could lead to ethical and legal consequences and questions, such as those regarding regulation, access, and even consent.",No date available,Health care analysis : HCA : journal of health philosophy and policy,"Bioethics, Empathy, Enhancement, Moral enhancement, Moral therapy, Neuroethics","Biomedical Enhancement, Empathy, Humans, Medicalization, Mental Disorders, Morals, Philosophy, Medical",10.1007/s10728-016-0320-8,"The Centre for Social Ethics and Policy, School of Law, University of Manchester, Williamson Building, Oxford Road, Manchester, M13 9PL, UK. sarah.carter-4@postgrad.manchester.ac.uk."
Comparative study of electrospun crystal-based and composite-based drug nano depots.,"Ke Wang, Pu Wang, Menglong Wang, Deng-Guang Yu, Fuxian Wan, S W Annie Bligh","Complex nanostructures are increasingly becoming important in the development of novel functional nanomaterials. Nano drug depots, characterized by core-shell structures with core drug reservoirs, are drawing increasing attention because of its potential applications in furnishing drug-sustained release profiles. In the present study, two kinds of nano drug depots, one containing a crystal drug reservoir and the other having a medicated composite drug reservoir, were prepared through modified triaxial electrospinning. Their drug-sustained release performances were compared in terms of initial burst release, middle linear release, and the late tailing off release. Although both depots had a linear morphology, clear core-shell nanostructures and the same cellulose acetate shell layer, they provided considerably different tailing off release performances, and thus different sustained release profiles. The composite-based drug depots showed a smaller tailing off drug amount of 2.2%, a shorter time period of 12 h, and a better zero-order controlled release kinetics in general than the crystal-based drug depots, whose tailing off amount was 9.3% over a time period of 36 h.

Choir Boy: Trans Vocal Performance and the De-Pathologization of Transition.,Marty Fink,"This paper will examine Choir Boy (2005), a trans coming-of-age novel by Charlie Anders, to disrupt historically rooted medical narratives of gender transition. Through a disability studies lens, this paper locates vocal performance as a means of speaking back to gatekeeping practices held in place by medical authorities since the inception of transsexuality as a classificatory category. Offering imaginative alternatives to ""wrong body"" diagnostics, this analysis places cultural texts in conversation with disability theory to reframe the trans self as a singing body that cannot be reduced to normalizing biomedical practices. Choir Boy frames vocal performance as a mode of gender expression and as a survival strategy against violence. The trans counter-narratives offered by Anders resist the medicalization of trans bodies and the classification of some bodies as not ""trans enough"" to qualify for transition. Choir Boy locates vocal performance and not binary gender identification as impetus for transition, thereby advocating for trans self-determination over medical access.",No date available,The Journal of medical humanities,"Gatekeeping, Gender, Queer, Trans, Transition","Gatekeeping, Humans, Male, Medicalization, Singing, Transsexualism, Violence, Voice",10.1007/s10912-018-9524-2,"Ryerson University, 350 Victoria Street, Toronto, ON, M5B 2K3, Canada. marty.fink@ryerson.ca."
"Not Sick: Liberal, Trans, and Crip Feminist Critiques of Medicalization.",Cristina S Richie,"Medicalization occurs when an aspect of embodied humanity is scrutinized by the medical industry, claimed as pathological, and subsumed under medical intervention. Numerous critiques of medicalization appear in academic literature, often put forth by bioethicists who use a variety of ""lenses"" to make their case. Feminist critiques of medicalization raise the concerns of the politically disenfranchised, thus seeking to protect women-particularly natal sex women-from medical exploitation. This article will focus on three feminist critiques of medicalization, which offer an alternative narrative of sickness and health. I will first briefly describe the philosophical origins of medicalization. Then, I will present three feminist critiques of medicalization. Liberal feminism, trans feminism, and crip feminism tend to regard Western medicine with a hermeneutics of suspicion and draw out potential harms of medicalization of reproductive sexuality, gender, and disability, respectively. While neither these branches of feminism-nor their critiques-are homogenous, they provide much-needed commentaries on phallocentric medicine.

Interaction order and the labeling of disorder: How parents mobilize personal knowledge in the clinic to resist medicalization of their children's behavior.,Jason Turowetz,"This paper examines how parents of children diagnosed with autism resist the medicalization of their children's behavior. Drawing on video and ethnographic data collected over four years of fieldwork at a clinic for developmental disorders, the paper distinguishes two orders of practice - that of the clinic and that of the family - and argues that behavior which is interpreted as disordered in the clinic may be seen as ordinary in the home. These different interpretations reflect and renew distinct orders of sensemaking in the clinic and home, and parents may mobilize familial knowledge of the child to counter the medicalization of specific behavior patterns, even where they otherwise accept an autism diagnosis. In showing how medicalization and labelling are achieved and resisted in the mundane details of social interaction, the paper contributes to studies of diagnosis, disability, and deviance. Further, the myriad ways parents and clinicians contest which regions of a child's behavior get medicalized - i.e. which behavioral patterns are labeled disordered - present a challenge to binary conceptions of medicalization, recommending instead a more nuanced model of medicalization as a multi-dimensional continuum: more or less, rather than either-or.",2022,Social science & medicine (1982),"Autism, Conversation analysis, Ethnomethodology, Interaction, Medicalization, Resistance","Autistic Disorder, Child, Family, Humans, Knowledge, Medicalization, Parents",10.1016/j.socscimed.2022.114719,"University of Siegen, Nordrhein-Westfalen, Germany; Garfinkel Archive, Newburyport, MA 01950, USA.

This paper aims to determine and explain disparities in ADHD prevalence and medication use among school-aged children in two distinct school systems, in Flanders (Belgium) and Québec (Canada). We present detailed descriptive and comparative analyses of data from 35 schools, 114 teachers, and 1046 parents (children) that were collected as part of a comparative international project. The data concern teacher and parent suspicions, teachers' ratings of ADHD-related behaviors in children, teachers' views of medication use, and teachers' beliefs about ADHD. The results show that, compared with Flanders, Québec had significantly more children diagnosed with ADHD and more frequent suspicions of ADHD in children by teachers and parents.

Contrary to the difference presumption, cultures are not homogenous unities that contrast in toto with one another.

What is wrong with 'being a pill-taker'? The special case of statins.,Louisa Polak,"In an interview study of decision-making about statins, many participants said they took pills regularly, yet described themselves as 'not really pill-takers'. This paper explores this paradox and its implications. The practice of pill-taking itself can constitute a challenge to the presentation of moral adequacy, beyond the potential for rendering stigmatised illnesses visible. Meeting this challenge involves a complex process of calibrating often-conflicting moral imperatives: to be concerned, but not too concerned, over one's health; to be informed, but not over-informed; and deferential but not over-deferential to medical expertise. This calibration reflects a broader tension between rival tropes: embracing medical progress and resisting medicalisation. Participants who take statins present them as unquestionably necessary; 'needing' pills, as opposed to choosing to take them, serves as a defence against the devalued identity of being a pill-taker. However, needing to take statins offers an additional threat to identity, because taking statins is widely perceived to be an alternative strategy to 'choosing a healthy lifestyle'. This perception underpins a responsibilising health promotion discourse that shapes and complicates the work participants do to avoid presenting themselves as 'pill-takers'. The salience of this discourse should be acknowledged where discussions of medicalisation use statins as an example.",2016,Sociology of health & illness,"adherence, cardiovascular disease, healthism, identity, medicalisation, surveillance medicine","Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Decision Making, Dyslipidemias, Female, Humans, Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors, Interviews as Topic, Male, Medicalization, Medication Adherence, Middle Aged, Perception",10.1111/1467-9566.12509,"Health Services Research and Policy, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK."

Optimal medication use in elders.

The older patients is a major consumer of prescription and nonprescription medications, and proper use of these agents can lead to more cost-effective strategies in reaching optimal health. A key difference in distinguishing appropriate from inappropriate drug use is evident in the themes of polymedicine and polypharmacy. Polymedicine describes the use of medications for an older population for the treatment of multiple co-morbid conditions, while polypharmacy represents a less-than-desirable state with duplicative medications, drug-to-drug interactions, and inadequate attention to pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles. The purpose of this paper is to outline strategies toward optimal medication use as a key to successful aging. Specifically, we discuss themes of cost-effective prescribing, the role of medication compliance, overuse and underuse of medication, over-the-counter products, alcohol abuse, and preventive medicine.

Molecular imprinting within hydrogels II: progress and analysis of the field.,"Mark E Byrne, Vishal Salian","In the past decade, there has been an exponential increase in the number of papers describing molecular imprinting in hydrogels, a technique which creates memory for template molecules within a flexible macromolecular structure. Macromolecular memory or structural plasticity of polymer chains is a superior description of weakly crosslinked imprinted networks since significant flexibility can occur within the polymer chains. The focus of this article is to review and highlight work in the field describing the imprinting strategy within hydrogels and associated challenges, characterization methods of imprinted gels, current and potential translational applications, and future strategies and directions. This paper also describes ways to improve binding parameter efficacy and presents significant areas of opportunity to further describe, characterize, and understand imprinted gels. An analysis of the literature indicates that imprinting in hydrogels leads to significant improvements in template affinity, capacity, and selectivity over non-templated hydrogels for a number of templates such as ions, small and moderate molecular weight molecules, proteins, viruses, DNA, and cells. However, the influence of imprinting on the transport of template is much more complex, with little attention of most studies to structural analysis or discussion of the gel porosity/tortuosity in the control of template transport. Responsive, intelligent imprinted hydrogels are also highlighted that exhibit reversibly modulated template binding and transport. It is clear that this field has transitioned from infancy and is leading to breakthroughs in a number of areas such as controlled and modulated drug delivery, diagnostic sensors, and separation. For example in drug delivery, imprinting can lead to delayed transport and provides further control of therapeutic transport through the macromolecular structure as well as optimizes the number of therapeutic molecules to polymer chains.",2008,International journal of pharmaceutics,No keywords,"Biological Transport, Chemistry, Pharmaceutical, Delayed-Action Preparations, Drug Carriers, Drug Delivery Systems, Hydrogels, Molecular Imprinting, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Polymers, Technology, Pharmaceutical",10.1016/j.ijpharm.2008.09.002,"Biomimetic & Biohybrid Materials, Biomedical Devices, Department of Chemical Engineering, Auburn University, Auburn, AL 36849, USA. byrneme@eng.auburn.edu"
Pressure-Sensitive Adhesive Combined with Paper Spray Mass Spectrometry for Low-Cost Collection and Analysis of Drug Residues.,"Chau Bao Nguyen, William R A Wichert, Daniel O Carmany, Ethan M McBride, Phillip M Mach, Elizabeth S Dhummakupt, Trevor Glaros, Nicholas E Manicke","Illicit drug use causes over half a million deaths worldwide every year. Drugs of abuse are commonly smuggled through customs and border checkpoints and, increasingly, through parcel delivery services. Improved methods for detection of trace drug residues from surfaces are needed. Such methods should be robust, fieldable, sensitive, and capable of detecting a wide range of drugs. In this work, commercially produced paper with a pressure-sensitive adhesive coating was utilized for the collection and analysis of trace drug residues by paper spray mass spectrometry (MS). This modified substrate was used to combine sample collection of drug residues from surfaces with rapid detection using a single paper spray ticket.

Medicalising short children with growth hormone? Ethical considerations of the underlying sociocultural aspects.,Maria Cristina Murano,"In 2003, the Food and Drug Administration approved the use of growth hormone treatment for idiopathic short stature children, i.e. children shorter than average due to an unknown medical cause. Given the absence of any pathological conditions, this decision has been contested as a case of medicalisation. The aim of this paper is to broaden the debate over the reasons for and against the treatment, to include considerations of the sociocultural phenomenon of the medicalisation of short stature, by means of a critical understanding of the concept of medicalisation. After defining my understanding of medicalisation and describing both the treatment and the condition of idiopathic short stature, I will problematise two fundamental issues: the medical/non-medical distinction and the debate about the goals of medicine. I will analyse them, combining perspectives of bioethics, medical sociology, philosophy of medicine and medical literature, and I will suggest that there are different levels of normativity of medicalisation. Ultimately, this study shows that: (1) the definition of idiopathic short stature, focusing only on actual height measurement, does not provide enough information to assess the need for treatment or not; (2) the analysis of the goals of medicine should be broadened to include justifications for the treatment; (3) the use of growth hormone for idiopathic short stature involves strong interests from different stakeholders. While the treatment might be beneficial for some children, it is necessary to be vigilant about possible misconduct at different levels of medicalisation.",No date available,"Medicine, health care, and philosophy","Bioethics, Children, Endocrinology, Growth hormone treatment, Medical sociology, Medicalisation, Philosophy of medicine","Biomedical Enhancement, Child, Ethics, Medical, Female, Growth Disorders, Human Growth Hormone, Humans, Male, Medicalization, Prescription Drug Overuse",10.1007/s11019-017-9798-6,"Department of Culture and Communication, Linköping University, 581 83, Linköping, Sweden. maria.cristina.murano@liu.se."
Fabrication of water/oil-resistant paper by nanocellulose stabilized Pickering emulsion and chitosan.,"Jinfeng Liu, Xi Chen, Hongkun Wang","Developing plastic/fluorine/silicon-free and degradable water/oil-resistant coatings for paper-based packaging materials to replace disposable plastic products is a very effective way to solve the problem of 'white pollution' or microplastics pollution. A novel water/oil-resistant coating was developed by alkyl ketene dimer (AKD)-based Pickering emulsion and chitosan in this work. Cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) were used as a stabilizing solid for AKD emulsion, with the addition of chitosan as an oil-resistance agent. The coating provides excellent hydrophobicity, water/oil resistance as well as good barrier properties. The water contact angle was as high as 130° and the minimum Cobb60 value was 5.7 g/m<sup>2</sup>, which was attributed to the hydrophobicity of AKD. In addition, the kit rating reached maximum 12/12 at coating weight of 8.26 g/m<sup>2</sup> and the water vapor transmittance rate (WVTR) was reduced to 153.4 g/(m<sup>2</sup>⋅day) at the coating weight of 10.50 g/m<sup>2</sup>. The tensile strength of the paper was increased from 28.1 to 43.6 MPa after coating. Overall, this coating can effectively improve the performance of paper-based materials, which may play an important role in the process of replacing disposable plastic packaging with paper-based materials.",2024,International journal of biological macromolecules,"AKD, Chitosan, Coating, Hydrophobic, Oil resistant, Pickering emulsion","Chitosan, Cellulose, Emulsions, Water, Paper, Oils, Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions, Tensile Strength, Nanofibers",10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2024.133609,"Sinopec Beijing Research Institute of Chemical Industry, Beijing 100013, China.

Rationalizing the selection of oral lipid based drug delivery systems by an in vitro dynamic lipolysis model for improved oral bioavailability of poorly water soluble drugs.,"Arik Dahan, Amnon Hoffman","As a consequence of modern drug discovery techniques, there has been a consistent increase in the number of new pharmacologically active lipophilic compounds that are poorly water soluble. A great challenge facing the pharmaceutical scientist is making these molecules into orally administered medications with sufficient bioavailability. One of the most popular approaches to improve the oral bioavailability of these molecules is the utilization of a lipid based drug delivery system. Unfortunately, current development strategies in the area of lipid based delivery systems are mostly empirical. Hence, there is a need for a simplified in vitro method to guide the selection of a suitable lipidic vehicle composition and to rationalize the delivery system design. To address this need, a dynamic in vitro lipolysis model, which provides a very good simulation of the in vivo lipid digestion process, has been developed over the past few years. This model has been extensively used for in vitro assessment of different lipid based delivery systems, leading to enhanced understanding of the suitability of different lipids and surfactants as a delivery system for a given poorly water soluble drug candidate. A key goal in the development of the dynamic in vitro lipolysis model has been correlating the in vitro data of various drug-lipidic delivery system combinations to the resultant in vivo drug profile. In this paper, we discuss and review the need for this model, its underlying theory, practice and limitations, and the available data accumulated in the literature. Overall, the dynamic in vitro lipolysis model seems to provide highly useful initial guidelines in the development process of oral lipid based drug delivery systems for poorly water soluble drugs, and it predicts phenomena that occur in the pre-enterocyte stages of the intestinal absorption cascade.",2008,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,No keywords,"Administration, Oral, Animals, Biological Availability, Chemistry, Pharmaceutical, Drug Carriers, Drug Compounding, Humans, Intestinal Absorption, Lipids, Lipolysis, Lymphatic System, Models, Biological, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Pharmacokinetics, Solubility, Technology, Pharmaceutical",10.1016/j.jconrel.2008.03.021,"Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA."

"Equipment and analytical companies meeting continuous challenges. May 20-21, 2014 Continuous Manufacturing Symposium.","Trevor Page, Henry Dubina, Gabriele Fillipi, Roland Guidat, Saroj Patnaik, Peter Poechlauer, Phil Shering, Martin Guinn, Peter Mcdonnell, Craig Johnston","This white paper focuses on equipment, and analytical manufacturers' perspectives, regarding the challenges of continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing across five prompt questions. In addition to valued input from several vendors, commentary was provided from experienced pharmaceutical representatives, who have installed various continuous platforms. Additionally, a small medium enterprise (SME) perspective was obtained through interviews. A range of technical challenges is outlined, including: the presence of particles, equipment scalability, fouling (and cleaning), technology derisking, specific analytical challenges, and the general requirement of improved technical training. Equipment and analytical companies can make a significant contribution to help the introduction of continuous technology. A key point is that many of these challenges exist in batch processing and are not specific to continuous processing. Backward compatibility of software is not a continuous issue per se. In many cases, there is available learning from other industries. Business models and opportunities through outsourced development partners are also highlighted. Agile smaller companies and academic groups have a key role to play in developing skills, working collaboratively in partnerships, and focusing on solving relevant industry challenges. The precompetitive space differs for vendor companies compared with large pharmaceuticals. Currently, there is no strong consensus around a dominant continuous design, partly because of business dynamics and commercial interests. A more structured common approach to process design and hardware and software standardization would be beneficial, with initial practical steps in modeling. Conclusions include a digestible systems approach, accessible and published business cases, and increased user, academic, and supplier collaboration. This mirrors US FDA direction. The concept of silos in pharmaceutical companies is a common theme throughout the white papers. In the equipment domain, this is equally prevalent among a broad range of companies, mainly focusing on discrete areas. As an example, the flow chemistry and secondary drug product communities are almost entirely disconnected. Control and Process Analytical Technologies (PAT) companies are active in both domains. The equipment actors are a very diverse group with a few major Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) players and a variety of SME, project providers, integrators, upstream downstream providers, and specialist PAT. In some cases, partnerships or alliances are formed to increase critical mass. This white paper has focused on small molecules; equipment associated with biopharmaceuticals is covered in a separate white paper. More specifics on equipment detail are provided in final dosage form and drug substance white papers. The equipment and analytical development from laboratory to pilot to production is important, with a variety of sensors and complexity reducing with scale. The importance of robust processing rather than overcomplex control strategy mitigation is important. A search of nonacademic literature highlights, with a few notable exceptions, a relative paucity of material. Much focuses on the economics and benefits of continuous, rather than specifics of equipment issues. The disruptive nature of continuous manufacturing represents either an opportunity or a threat for many companies, so the incentive to change equipment varies. Also, for many companies, the pharmaceutical sector is not actually the dominant sector in terms of sales.",2014,Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,"Processing, analytical chemistry, crystal engineering, mathematical models, unit operations","Biological Products, Consumer Product Safety, Cooperative Behavior, Cost-Benefit Analysis, Drug Contamination, Drug Costs, Drug Industry, Equipment Contamination, Equipment Design, Humans, Interdisciplinary Communication, Patient Safety, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Public-Private Sector Partnerships, Quality Control, Technology, Pharmaceutical, Workflow",10.1002/jps.24282,"GEA Pharma Systems Ltd., Eastleigh, Hampshire, SO53 4ZD, UK."

From distress to disease: a critique of the medicalisation of possession in DSM-5.,Divya Padmanabhan,"This paper critiques the category of possession-form dissociative identity disorder as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 (DSM-5) published in 2013 by the American Psychiatric Association (APA). The DSM as an index of psychiatry pathologises possession by categorising it as a form of dissociative identity disorder. Drawing upon ethnographic fieldwork, this paper argues that such a pathologisation medicalises possession, which is understood as a non-pathological condition in other contexts such as by those individuals who manifest possession at a temple in Kerala, South India. Through medicalising and further by creating distinctions between acceptable and pathological possession, the DSM converts a form of distress into a disease. This has both conceptual and pragmatic implications. The temple therefore becomes reduced to a culturally acceptable site for the manifestation of a mental illness in a form that is culturally available and possession is explained solely through a biomedical framework, denying alternative conceptualisations and theories which inform possession. By focussing on the DSM-5 classification of possession and the limitations of such a classification, this paper seeks to posit an alternative conceptualisation of possession by engaging with three primary areas which are significant in the DSM categorisation of possession: the DSM's conceptualisation of self in the singular, the distinction between pathological and non-pathological forms of possession, and the limitations of the DSM's equation of the condition of possession with the manifestation of possession. Finally, the paper briefly highlights alternative conceptualisations of possession, which emerged from the perspective of those seeking to heal possession at the Chottanikkara temple.",No date available,Anthropology & medicine,"Kerala, Spirit possession, disease, distress, healing, treatment","Anthropology, Medical, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Humans, India, Medicalization, Mental Disorders, Religion, Spirit Possession",10.1080/13648470.2017.1389168,"a School of Social Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University , New Delhi , India."
"Fingermarks development on gloves: Relative efficiency of 1,2 Indanedione/ZnCl<sub>2</sub>, ninhydrin and wet powder.","Mélina Rousseau, Pierre Ledroit, Marianne Malo, Damien Henrot, Hélène Guille","Powder suspensions such as wet powder are used to develop fingermarks on adhesive surfaces.

It then shows how, while reducing maternal mortality, its use as an illegal abortifacient has reinforced the double reproductive citizenship regime existing in countries with restrictive abortion laws and poor post-abortion care services, where poor women using it illegally are stigmatised, discriminated against and exposed to potentially severe health risks.",No date available,"Historia, ciencias, saude--Manguinhos",No keywords,"Abortifacient Agents, Nonsteroidal, Abortion, Criminal, Abortion, Spontaneous, Adolescent, Adult, Attitude of Health Personnel, Brazil, Female, Hospitals, Maternity, Hospitals, Public, Humans, Interviews as Topic, Marital Status, Medicalization, Misoprostol, Morals, Organizational Culture, Personnel, Hospital, Pregnancy, Professional-Patient Relations, Social Discrimination, Young Adult",10.1590/S0104-59702016000100003,"Department of Anthropology, Universitat de Barcelona."
Bacteria survival probability in bactericidal filter paper.,"Nura Mansur-Azzam, Zeinab Hosseinidoust, Su Gyeong Woo, Renata Vyhnalkova, Adi Eisenberg, Theo G M van de Ven","Bactericidal filter papers offer the simplicity of gravity filtration to simultaneously eradicate microbial contaminants and particulates. We previously detailed the development of biocidal block copolymer micelles that could be immobilized on a filter paper to actively eradicate bacteria. Despite the many advantages offered by this system, its widespread use is hindered by its unknown mechanism of action which can result in non-reproducible outcomes. In this work, we sought to investigate the mechanism by which a certain percentage of Escherichia coli cells survived when passing through the bactericidal filter paper. Through the process of elimination, the possibility that the bacterial survival probability was controlled by the initial bacterial load or the existence of resistant sub-populations of E. coli was dismissed. It was observed that increasing the thickness or the number of layers of the filter significantly decreased bacterial survival probability for the biocidal filter paper but did not affect the efficiency of the blank filter paper (no biocide). The survival probability of bacteria passing through the antibacterial filter paper appeared to depend strongly on the number of collision between each bacterium and the biocide-loaded micelles. It was thus hypothesized that during each collision a certain number of biocide molecules were directly transferred from the hydrophobic core of the micelle to the bacterial lipid bilayer membrane. Therefore, each bacterium must encounter a certain number of collisions to take up enough biocide to kill the cell and cells that do not undergo the threshold number of collisions are expected to survive.",2014,"Colloids and surfaces.

On good and bad forms of medicalization.,Erik Parens,"The ongoing 'enhancement' debate pits critics of new self-shaping technologies against enthusiasts. One important thread of that debate concerns medicalization, the process whereby 'non-medical' problems become framed as 'medical' problems. In this paper I consider the charge of medicalization, which critics often level at new forms of technological self-shaping, and explain how that charge can illuminate--and obfuscate. Then, more briefly, I examine the charge of pharmacological Calvinism, which enthusiasts, in their support of technological self-shaping, often level at critics. And I suggest how that charge, too, can illuminate and obfuscate. Exploring the broad charge of medicalization and the narrower counter charge of pharmacological Calvinism leads me to conclude that, as satisfying as it can be to level one of those charges at our intellectual opponents, and as tempting as it is to lie down and rest with our favorite insight, we need to gather the energy to have a conversation about the difference between good and bad forms of medicalization. Specifically, I suggest that if we consider the 'medicalization of love,' we can see why critics of and enthusiasts about technological self-shaping should want (and in some cases have already begun) to distinguish between good and bad forms of such medicalization.",2011,Bioethics,No keywords,"Drug Therapy, Ethical Analysis, Humans, Medicalization, Morals, Social Values",10.1111/j.1467-8519.2011.01885.x,"The Hastings Center, Garrison, New York 10524 USA. parense@thehastingscenter.org"
Highly water-resistant paper via infiltration with polymeric microspheres from nanocellulose-stabilized plant oil-derived monomer.,"Wei Gao, Tong Wu, Yaming Cheng, Jie Wang, Liang Yuan, Zhongkai Wang, Baoxia Wang","Sustainable strategies to improve the water resistance of cellulose paper are actively sought. In this work, polymeric microspheres (PMs), prepared through emulsion polymerization of cellulose nanofibers stabilized rubber seed oil-derived monomer, were investigated as coatings on corrugated medium paper (CMP). After infiltrating porous paper with PMs, the water-resistant corrugated papers (WRCP<sub>n</sub>) with enhanced mechanical properties were obtained. When 30 wt% PMs were introduced, WRCP<sub>30</sub> turned out to be highly compacted with an increased water contact angle of 106.3° and a low water vapor transmission rate of 81 g/(m<sup>2</sup> d) at 23 °C. Meanwhile, the tensile strength of WRCP<sub>30</sub> increased to 22.2 MPa, a 4-fold increase from CMP. When tested in a well-hydrated state, 71% of its mechanical strength in the dry state was maintained. Even with a low content of 10 wt% PMs, WRCP<sub>10</sub> also exhibited stable tensile strength and water wettability during the cyclic soaking-drying process.

Controlling Macroscopic Phase Separation of Aqueous Two-Phase Polymer Systems in Porous Media.,"David Y Pereira, Chloe M Wu, So Youn Lee, Eumene Lee, Benjamin M Wu, Daniel T Kamei","In previous work, our group discovered a phenomenon in which a mixed polymer-salt or mixed micellar aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) separates into its two constituent phases as it flows within paper. While these ATPSs worked well in their respective studies to concentrate the target biomarker and improve the sensitivity of the lateral-flow immunoassay, different ATPSs can be advantageous for new applications based on factors such as biomarker partitioning or biochemical compatibility between ATPS and sample components. However, since the mechanism of phase separation in porous media is not completely understood, introducing other ATPSs to paper is an unpredictable process that relies on trial and error experiments. This is especially true for polymer-polymer ATPSs in which the characteristics of the two phases appear quite similar. Therefore, our group aimed to develop semiquantitative guidelines for choosing ATPSs that can phase separate in paper. In this work, we evaluated the Washburn equation and its parameters as a potential mathematical framework to describe the flow behavior of polymer-salt and micellar ATPSs in fiberglass paper. We compared bulk phase fluid characteristics and identified the viscosity difference between the phases as a key determinant of the potential for phase separation in paper. We then used this parameter to predict the phase separation capabilities of polyethylene glycol (PEG)-dextran ATPSs in paper and control the composition of the leading and lagging phases. We also, for the first time, successfully demonstrated the phase separation phenomenon in hydrogels, thereby extending its application and potential benefits to an alternative porous medium.",2019,SLAS technology,"Washburn equation, aqueous two-phase system, hydrogels, paper fluidics, point-of-care diagnostics","Dextrans, Hydrogels, Micelles, Octoxynol, Paper, Polyethylene Glycols, Polymers, Porosity, Salts, Surface Properties, Viscosity",10.1177/2472630319861369,"Department of Bioengineering, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA., Department of Bioengineering, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA., Department of Bioengineering, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA., Department of Bioengineering, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA., Department of Bioengineering, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA., Department of Bioengineering, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA."
Female genital mutilation/cutting: Emerging factors sustaining medicalization related changes in selected Kenyan communities.,"Samuel Kimani, Caroline W Kabiru, Jacinta Muteshi, Jaldesa Guyo","Although female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) has declined, it is pervasive albeit changing form among communities in Kenya. Transformation of FGM/C include medicalization although poorly understood has increased undermining abandonment efforts for the practice. We sought to understand drivers of medicalization in FGM/C among selected Kenyan communities. A qualitative study involving participants from Abagusii, Somali and Kuria communities and key informants with health care providers from four Kenyan counties was conducted. Data were collected using in-depth interviews (n = 54), key informant interviews (n = 56) and 45 focus group discussions. Data were transcribed and analyzed thematically using NVivo version 12. We found families practiced FGM/C for reasons including conformity to culture/tradition, religion, marriageability, fear of negative sanctions, and rite of passage. Medicalized FGM/C was only reported by participants from the Abagusii and Somali communities. Few Kuria participants shared that medicalized FGM/C was against their culture and would attract sanctions. Medicalized FGM/C was perceived to have few health complications, shorter healing, and enables families to hide from law. To avoid arrest or sanctions, medicalized FGM/C was performed at home/private clinics. Desire to mitigate health complications and income were cited as reasons for health providers performing of FGM/C. Medicalization was believed to perpetuate the practice as it was perceived as modernized FGM/C. FGM/C remains pervasive in the studied Kenyan communities albeit changed form and context. Findings suggest medicalization sustain FGM/C by allowing families and health providers to conform to social norms underpinning FGM/C while addressing risks of FGM/C complications and legal prohibitions.

Is the full potential of the biopharmaceutics classification system reached?,"Christel A S Bergström, Sara B E Andersson, Jonas H Fagerberg, Gert Ragnarsson, Anders Lindahl","In this paper we analyse how the biopharmaceutics classification system (BCS) has been used to date. A survey of the literature resulted in a compilation of 242 compounds for which BCS classes were reported. Of these, 183 compounds had been reported to belong to one specific BCS class whereas 59 compounds had been assigned to multiple BCS classes in different papers. Interestingly, a majority of the BCS class 2 compounds had fraction absorbed (FA) values >85%, indicating that they were completely absorbed after oral administration. Solubility was computationally predicted at pH 6.8 for BCS class 2 compounds to explore the impact of the pH of the small intestine, where most of the absorption occurs, on the solubility. In addition, the solubilization capacity of lipid aggregates naturally present in the intestine was studied computationally and experimentally for a subset of 12 compounds. It was found that all acidic compounds with FA>85% were completely dissolved in the pH of the small intestine. Further, lipids at the concentration used in fasted state simulated intestinal fluid (FaSSIF) dissolved the complete dose given of the most lipophilic (logD6.5>3) compounds studied. Overall, biorelevant dissolution media (pure buffer of intestinal pH or FaSSIF) identified that for 20 of the 29 BCS class 2 compounds with FA>85% the complete dose given orally would be dissolved. These results indicate that a more relevant pH restriction for acids and/or dissolution medium with lipids present better forecast solubility-limited absorption in vivo than the presently used BCS solubility criterion. The analysis presented herein further strengthens the discussion on the requirement of more physiologically relevant dissolution media for the in vitro solubility classification performed to reach the full potential of the BCS.",2013,European journal of pharmaceutical sciences : official journal of the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences,"Biopharmaceutics classification system, Biorelevant dissolution, Dose number, In silico, Poorly soluble, Solubility","Administration, Oral, Animals, Biopharmaceutics, Computer Simulation, Humans, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Intestinal Absorption, Intestinal Mucosa, Models, Biological, Permeability, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Pharmacokinetics, Reproducibility of Results, Solubility, Terminology as Topic",10.1016/j.ejps.2013.09.010,"Department of Pharmacy, Uppsala University, Biomedical Centre, P.O.

Disordered eating and the contradictions of neoliberal governance.,Iain Pirie,"The last decade has seen the development of an important literature on the contradictions between neoliberal norms of corporal citizenship and the forms of consumption that market-based food systems promote. This paper seeks to contribute to the literature by exploring the relationship between these contradictions and the increased prevalence of particular eating disorders (binge eating disorder (BED) and bulimia nervosa). Within contemporary neoliberal food systems bingeing is increasingly normalised and consumption temporally disorganised. At the same time, neoliberal public health policy, and the wider 'health' entertainment media it legitimates, focuses on the promotion of 'correct' forms of consumer agency. Individuals who fail to manage consumption 'appropriately' are stigmatised. The growth of bulimia and BED can be related to the contradictory pressures that the food system and regime of corporal governance place on individuals. The paper also seeks to explore how the increased medicalisation and biomedicalisation of eating since the 1980s fits within a broader neoliberal governance strategy. By medicalising key social problems the neoliberal state depoliticises these issues. Medicalisation and biomedicalisation obscure the role of capitalism in generating these problems and encourage a focus on individual dysfunction.",2016,Sociology of health & illness,"capitalism, consumption, diet, eating disorders, government/state, political economy","Binge-Eating Disorder, Bulimia Nervosa, Capitalism, Diet, Feeding Behavior, Health Policy, Humans, Medicalization, Public Policy",10.1111/1467-9566.12408,"Department of Politics, University of Warwick, UK."

Taking pills for developmental ails in Southern Brazil: The biologization of adolescence?,Dominique P Béhague,"In the late 1990s researchers in Pelotas Southern Brazil began documenting what they considered to be unacceptably high rates of licensed psychotropic use among individuals of all ages, including youth. This came as a surprise, since the vast majority of psychiatrists in Pelotas draw on psychoanalytic theory and approach pharmaceutical use, especially for children and adolescents, in a consciously tempered way. Drawing from a longitudinal ethnographic sub-study, part of a larger 1982 birth cohort study, this paper follows the circuitous trajectories of emergent pharma-patterns among ""shantytown"" youth over a ten-year period, exploring the thickly layered and often moralized contingencies in which psychodynamic psychiatrists' intention to resist excessive pharmaceuticalization both succeed and crumble. I juxtapose these trajectories with the growing salience of an ""anti-biologizing"" explanatory framework that psychiatrists and researchers are using to pre-empt the kind of diagnostics-driven ""biopsychiatrization"" so prevalent in North America. My analysis suggests that psychiatrists' use of this framework ironically contributes to their failed attempts to ""resist"" pharmaceuticalization.",2014,Social science & medicine (1982),"Brazil, Child psychiatry, Epistemology, Medicalization, Pharmaceuticals, Prototype, Psychoanalysis","Adolescent, Anthropology, Cultural, Biology, Brazil, Humans, Inappropriate Prescribing, Longitudinal Studies, Medicalization, Poverty, Practice Patterns, Physicians', Prospective Studies, Psychiatry, Psychology, Adolescent, Psychotropic Drugs, Young Adult",10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.11.028,"Vanderbilt University, USA; King's College London, UK; London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, UK.

Analysing the skin barrier from down under.,"J Grice, H A E Benson","Over the past 40 years the Australian contribution to the field of skin science has been led by Michael Roberts. One of his earliest papers on membrane permeation was published in Nature, setting the scene for his huge contribution to both the fundamental understanding of skin permeability and the application of that knowledge to improved clinical outcomes, new delivery technologies and minimizing toxicological risk. His work has been characterized by a mechanistic, mathematical approach to defining skin permeation. He defined the parameters important to skin permeation, established structure-penetration relationships and demonstrated the importance of maximum flux from a clinical and toxicological viewpoint. Through his systematic approach, Mike showed a parabolic relationship between maximum flux and lipophilicity, and established that this is driven mainly by variations in solubility of the solute in the stratum corneum. One of the significant strengths of Mike's work is the ability to express biological concepts in mathematical terms. He has developed mathematical models that enhance our understanding of epidermal, dermal, deep tissue permeation and follicular transport. Throughout his career Mike has been involved in pioneering new technologies both for analysing the skin barrier and influencing permeation across it. His fundamental work in the area of iontophoresis provided models that defined the parameters influencing its permeation enhancement. Mike's research has been translated into improved clinical outcomes, reduced toxicological risk and changes to the regulation of skin products.

Distance-based paper device coupled with uracil-rich DNA hydrogel for visual quantification of Uracil-DNA glycosylase.,"Wei Xue, Yunping Wu, Xiaoqian Li, Qian Zhang, Yanfang Wu, Yangyang Chang, Meng Liu","Uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG), an enzyme for repairing uracil-containing DNA damage, is crucial for maintaining genomic stability. Simple and fast quantification of UDG activity is essential for biological assay and clinical diagnosis, since its aberrant level is associated with DNA damage and various diseases. Herein, we developed a fully integrated ""sample in-signal out"" distance-based paper analytical device (dPAD) for visual quantification of UDG using a flow-controlled uracil-rich DNA hydrogel (URDH). The uracil base sites contained in the DNA hydrogel are mis-incorporated with dUTP by rolling circle amplification (RCA), which simplifies the preparation process of the functionalized hydrogel. In the presence of UDG, the uracil in URDH can be recognized and removed to induce the permeability change of URDH, resulting in the visible distance signal along the paper channel. Using dPAD, as low as 6.4 × 10<sup>-4</sup> U/mL of UDG (within 80 min) is visually identified without any instruments and complicated operations. This integrated dPAD is advantageous for its simplicity, cost effectiveness, and ease of use.

A separation-free paper-based hydrogel device for one-step reactive oxygen species determination by a smartphone.,"Jie Chu, Yiyi Zhang, Jingwen Li, Jun Hong, Lin Sun, Jianshe Wei","Paper-based analytical devices (PADs) are very convenient for determining biomarkers in point-of-care (POC) diagnosis while requiring sample pre-treatment or impurity separation. This study reports a novel hydrogel-coupled, paper-based analytical device (PAD) for separation-free H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> colorimetric detection in both aqueous solution and cell lysis with sample-to-answer analysis by directly loading into the sample test zone. By encapsulating an inorganic mimic enzyme and chromogenic substrate into the sodium alginate (SA) hydrogel, amplification of the color signal after catalyzing the substrate could be achieved. Taking advantage of the nanoscale porous structure of the hydrogel and the lateral flow channel of the PAD, large interference fragments or bio-macromolecules are prevented from diffusing into the chromogenic reaction, whereas the small target molecules enter the sensing region to trigger the catalytic reaction. This method demonstrated a rapid and accurate analysis with a limit of detection as low as 0.06 mM and detection selectivity.

The problem of over-medicalisation: How AOD disease models perpetuate inequity for young people with multiple disadvantage.,"J Bryant, G Caluzzi, A Bruun, J Sundbery, M Ferry, R M Gray, J Skattebol, J Neale, S MacLean","Young people who experience multiple disadvantage have been identified as some of the most marginalised and under-serviced people in the alcohol and other drug (AOD) system. In this paper, we draw on a range of research evidence to argue that one of the challenges in responding appropriately to the needs of these young people are models of care which seek to ameliorate 'illness' rather than promote wellness. While disease approaches have some important benefits, overly-medicalised AOD treatment responses also have negative impacts. We argue that disease models rest on understandings of substance use as an individual enterprise and thereby pay insufficient attention to the material disadvantage that shape young people's substance use, creating feelings of shame, failure and a reluctance to return to care if they continue to use. Additionally we draw on literature that shows how disease models construe young people's substance use as compulsive, perpetuating deficit views of them as irrational and failing to account for the specific meanings that young people themselves give to their substance use. By focusing on clinical solutions rather than material and relational ones, medicalised treatment responses perpetuate inequity: they benefit young people whose resources and normative values align with the treatments offered by disease models, but are much less helpful to those who are under-resourced,.

"Procreation machines: Ectogenesis as reproductive enhancement, proper medicine or a step towards posthumanism?","Johanna Eichinger, Tobias Eichinger","Full ectogenesis as the complete externalization of human reproduction by bypassing the bodily processes of gestation and childbirth can be considered the culmination of genetic and reproductive technologies. Despite its still being a hypothetical scenario, it has been discussed for decades as the ultimate means to liberate women from their reproductive tasks in society and hence finally end fundamental gender injustices generally. In the debate about the application of artificial wombs to achieve gender equality, one aspect is barely mentioned but is of crucial relevance from a medical-ethical perspective: whether and how could full ectogenesis be justified as a proper use of medicine? After characterizing the technology as a special form of human enhancement and as an extension of medical practice that goes beyond the traditional field of medicine, this paper critically assesses the theoretical possibilities of legitimizing this extension. We identify two ways of justification: either one argues that ectogenesis fulfils a proper goal of medicine (a justification we call pathologization), or one argues that the application of ectogenesis achieves a non-medical goal (which we call medicalization). Because it is important from a medical-ethical point of view to avoid an inappropriate instrumentalization or misuse of medicine and thus an undue medicalization of non-medical problems, a set of necessary conditions has to be met. It is doubtful whether full ectogenesis for non-medical purposes could fulfil these conditions.

Comprehensive CD analysis, employing both approaches, i.e., traditional with their sector and helicity rules, and state-of-the-art supported by quantum chemistry (QC) calculations along with solvation models for both electronic (ECD) and vibrational (VCD) circular dichroism ranges, allows confident defining stereochemistry of the β-lactams studied.

Microfabrication can create architecturally complex scaffolds for 3D cell cultures that circumvent some of these limitations; unfortunately, these approaches require instrumentation not commonly available in biology laboratories.

Altering gas permeability at the ends of stacks controlled the gradient in the concentration of the O(2) and was sufficient by itself to determine the distribution of viable cells in 3D.

[Palliative care: between humanization and medicalization at the end of life].,Juan Pedro Alonso,"This paper analyzes the palliative care of terminal patients, examining the tensions between the humanization of care and the progressive medicalization at the end-of-life situation.

The article describes the configuration of personalized and comprehensive health care based on the core values of more humanized end-of-life care promoted by palliative care supporters. Similarly, the paper analyzes how these practices are assisted by progress in the medicalization process in which the dimension of care is considered less an unprofessional area of medical practice than an area of care in which specific technical skills and know-how are employed.

Active Barrier Coating for Packaging Paper with Controlled Release of Sunflower Oils.,Pieter Samyn,"The use of paper as a sustainable packaging material is favored, but it lacks sufficient barrier properties in terms of water repellence and oil resistance. Novel approaches consider active packaging materials or coatings with controlled release providing additional functionality for delivery of specific components to the surface. In this study, the development of a waterborne coating with organic nanoparticles and encapsulated sunflower oils is presented as a system for thermal release of the oil and on-demand tuning of the final barrier properties of the paper substrate. After synthesis of the nanoparticles, it seems that the encapsulation of various grades of sunflower oil (i.e., either poly-unsaturated or mono-unsaturated) strongly affects the encapsulation efficiency and thermal release profiles. The water contact angles are controlled by the oil release and chemical surface composition of the coating upon thermal heating. The oil resistance of the paper improves as a more continuous oil film is formed during thermal release. In particular, the chemical surface composition of the paper coatings is detailed by means of micro-Raman spectroscopy and surface imaging, which provide an analytical quantification tool to evaluate surface coverage, oil delivery, and variations in organic coating moieties.",2021,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)","barrier, coating, encapsulation, hydrophobicity, oleophobicity, packaging, paper, release, vegetable oil","Delayed-Action Preparations, Food Packaging, Nanoparticles, Paper, Sunflower Oil, Water",3561,"Analytical and Circular Chemistry, Hasselt University, 3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium."
Vitrification of bovine matured oocytes and blastocysts in a paper container.,"Ashit Kumar Paul, Yuanyuan Liang, Kanokwan Srirattana, Takashi Nagai, Rangsun Parnpai","In the present study, we aimed to determine the applicability of a paper container for the vitrification of in vitro matured (IVM) bovine oocytes. In experiment 1, IVM oocytes were exposed to vitrification solution (20% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), 20% ethylene glycol (EG), and 5 mol/L sucrose), using a two-step method, for 30 s; loaded onto either a paper container or Cryotop; and stored in liquid nitrogen. No significant difference (P < 0.05) in the survival and blastocyst formation rates after in vitro vitrification was observed between the paper container and Cryotop. In experiment 2, IVM oocytes were exposed to either a two- or three-step vitrification solution. The three-step vitrification solution was not significantly different from the two-step solution in terms of oocyte survival, cleavage and blastocyst rates. In experiment 3, in vitro produced blastocysts were graded according to the manual of the International Embryo Transfer Society (grades 1 and 2) and vitrified using the two- and three-step methods. For grade 2 blastocysts, the three-step method showed significantly higher (P < 0.05) survival and hatched blastocyst rates than the two-step method, whereas for grade 1 blastocysts, no significant difference was observed.

In 2020, the WG developed and distributed a detailed questionnaire on protein non-naïve NHP reuse to the WG member companies. The WG received responses from key stakeholders including principal investigators, facility managers, animal welfare officers and research scientists. This paper's content reflects the consolidated opinion of the WG members and the questionnaire responses on the subject of NHP reuse within nonclinical programs at all stages of research and development. Many of the pharmaceutical companies represented in the working group or participating in the questionnaire have already achieved some level of NHP reuse in their nonclinical programs, but the survey results suggested that there is significant potential to increase NHP reuse further and a need to understand the considerations involved in reuse more clearly. The WG has also focused carefully on the inherent concerns and risks of implementing protein non-naive NHP reuse and has evaluated the best methods of risk assessment and decision-making. This paper presents a discussion on the challenges and opportunities surrounding protein non-naïve NHP reuse and aims to stimulate further industry dialogue on the subject and provide guidance for pharmaceutical companies to establish roadmaps and decision trees enabling increased protein non-naïve NHP reuse.

Toxicological Drug Screening using Paper Spray High-Resolution Tandem Mass Spectrometry (HR-MS/MS).,"Josiah McKenna, Rachel Jett, Kevin Shanks, Nicholas E Manicke","Immunoassays and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) are both widely used methods for drug screening in toxicology. We investigated an alternative approach for rapid drug screening: paper spray MS (PS-MS). In paper spray, the biofluid sample is spotted onto a paper substrate. Upon application of a spray solvent and an electric potential, extraction and ionization occur directly from the paper without any need for additional sample preparation. We developed two paper spray high-resolution MS/MS targeted drug screening assays using a quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometer, one the positive ion mode and one in the negative ion mode. In the positive ion mode, over 130 drugs and drug metabolites were semi-quantitatively screened at sub-toxic concentrations in a single 2.5 min analysis. Limits of detection and calibration performances for each target compound are reported. The PS-MS/MS assay was tested on authentic postmortem specimens, and its screening ability and semi-quantitative performance were evaluated against independent LC-MS-MS screening and confirmation assays with good agreement. The paper spray MS/MS showed good qualitative agreement with LC-MS-MS; the true positive rate of paper spray MS/MS was 92%, and the true negative rate was over 98%. The quantitative results between the two methods were also acceptable for a screening application; Passing-Bablok regression yielded a slope of 1.17 and a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.996.

Rationalism and the disembodiment of modern childbirth: the case for an ecology of childbirth.,"Federico Ignacio Viola, Ana María Bonet de Viola, Marisa Espinoza","The paper proposes a genealogy of the biomedical paradigm surrounding childbirth, with the aim of deconstructing the principles of rationalism that led to the objectification of the body and to the consequent commodification of birth. We intend to demonstrate how such a conception of the body and of sensibility determines the birth process, which leads us to consider it an event that is relational in nature. Methodologically, this deconstruction is carried out through a critical-descriptive genealogy of the theoretical assumptions of the rationalist conception of the body. By developing the concept of ecology of childbirth, we intend to call into question this relational nature of the body and to recover the value of corporeality and embodiment as a language of proximity, within a theoretical framework of the ethics of difference.

However, getting quantitative data can be quite a bit more difficult. Distance-based devices provide a user-friendly means of obtaining quantitative data without the need for any additional equipment, simply by using an included ruler or calibrated markings. This article details the development of a quantitative DNA detection device that utilizes the aggregation of polystyrene microspheres to affect the distance that microspheres wick through filter paper. The microspheres are conjugated to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) oligomers that are partially complementary to a target strand and, in the presence of the target strand, form a three-strand complex, resulting in the formation of aggregates. The higher the concentration of the target strand, the larger the aggregate, and the shorter the distance wicked by the microspheres. This behavior was investigated across a wide range of target concentrations and under different incubation times to understand aggregate formation. The device was then used to successfully detect a target strand spiked in extracted plant DNA.",2019,SLAS technology,"DNA detection, aggregation, distance-based, microsphere, paper-based","Capillary Action, DNA, Microfluidic Analytical Techniques, Microspheres, Paper, Plant Extracts",10.1177/2472630319887680,"Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of California Riverside, Riverside, CA, USA., Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of California Riverside, Riverside, CA, USA., Gulu University Bioscience Research Laboratories, Gulu, Uganda., Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of California Riverside, Riverside, CA, USA., Department of Bioengineering, University of California Riverside, Riverside, CA, USA., Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of California Riverside, Riverside, CA, USA., Gulu University Bioscience Research Laboratories, Gulu, Uganda., Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of California Riverside, Riverside, CA, USA."
How sociophenomenology of the body problematises the 'problem-oriented approach' to growth hormone treatment.,"Maria Cristina Murano, Jenny Slatman, Kristin Zeiler","This article examines how people who are shorter than average make sense of their lived experience of embodiment. It offers a sociophenomenological analysis of 10 semistructured interviews conducted in the Netherlands, focusing on if, how, and why height matters to them. It draws theoretically on phenomenological discussions of lived and objective space, intercorporeality and norms about bodies. The analysis shows that height as a lived phenomenon (1) is active engagement in space, (2) coshapes habituated ways of behaving and (3) is shaped by gendered norms and beliefs about height. Based on this analysis, the article challenges what we label as the 'problem-oriented approach' to discussions about growth hormone treatment for children with idiopathic short stature. In this approach, possible psychosocial disadvantages or problems of short stature and quantifiable height become central to the ethical evaluation of growth hormone treatment at the expense of first-hand lived experiences of short stature and height as a lived phenomenon. Based on our sociophenomenological analysis, this paper argues that the rationale for giving growth hormone treatment should combine medical and psychological assessments with investigations of lived experiences of the child. Such an approach would allow considerations not only of possible risks or disadvantages of short stature but also of the actual ways in which the child makes sense of her or his height.",2018,Medical humanities,"child health, endocrinology including diabetes, medical ethics/bioethics, medical humanities, philosophy","Attitude, Body Height, Child, Comprehension, Female, Growth Disorders, Growth Hormone, Hormone Replacement Therapy, Humans, Male, Medicalization, Netherlands, Self Concept",10.1136/medhum-2018-011548,"Department of Culture and Communication, Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden., Department of Culture Studies, Tilburg University, Tilburg, The Netherlands., Department of Thematic Studies: Technology and Social Change, Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden."

Ionization Suppression and Recovery in Direct Biofluid Analysis Using Paper Spray Mass Spectrometry.,"Carolina Vega, Corina Spence, Chengsen Zhang, Brandon J Bills, Nicholas E Manicke","Paper spray mass spectrometry is a method for the direct analysis of biofluid samples in which extraction of analytes from dried biofluid spots and electrospray ionization occur from the paper on which the dried sample is stored. We examined matrix effects in the analysis of small molecule drugs from urine, plasma, and whole blood. The general method was to spike stable isotope labeled analogs of each analyte into the spray solvent, while the analyte itself was in the dried biofluid. Intensity of the labeled analog is proportional to ionization efficiency, whereas the ratio of the analyte intensity to the labeled analog in the spray solvent is proportional to recovery. Ion suppression and recovery were found to be compound- and matrix-dependent. Highest levels of ion suppression were obtained for poor ionizers (e.g., analytes lacking basic aliphatic amine groups) in urine and approached -90%. Ion suppression was much lower or even absent for good ionizers (analytes with aliphatic amines) in dried blood spots. Recovery was generally highest in urine and lowest in blood. We also examined the effect of two experimental parameters on ion suppression and recovery: the spray solvent and the sample position (how far away from the paper tip the dried sample was spotted). Finally, the change in ion suppression and analyte elution as a function of time was examined by carrying out a paper spray analysis of dried plasma spots for 5 min by continually replenishing the spray solvent.

"""A midwife at every confinement"": Midwifery and Medicalized Childbirth in Ontario and Britain, 1920-1950.",Gwenith Siobhan Cross,"This paper compares midwifery in Ontario and Britain in the first half of the 20th century. British midwives improved maternal and infant health and welfare by making childbirth a cooperative, medically managed event in conjunction with physicians. British midwives thus participated in, and contributed to, developments in obstetrics. In contrast, Ontario physicians worked to exclude midwives from participation in the modernization of birth management, relying on a narrower concept of ""medicalization"" defined as physician dominance. This study challenges the medical profession's assumptions that the exclusion of midwifery in Ontario was necessary to the medicalization of childbirth.

Hydrogel Paper-Based Analytical Devices: Separation-Free In Situ Assay of Small-Molecule Targets in Whole Blood.,"Jia Xu, Habib Khan, Li Yang","While colorimetric-based assays are very convenient to determine biomarkers in point-of-care testing (POCT), they often suffer from pretreatment procedures for separation of plasma or serum from whole blood samples. Here, we report a simple colorimetric paper-based analytical device (<i>c</i>-PAD) that is capable of performing sample-to-answer analysis by directly dropping the whole blood sample on paper. This is accomplished by utilizing sodium alginate hydrogel, which exhibits a nanometer-scale porous structure to effectively prevent the passage of large red blood cells and hemoglobin molecules, to encapsulate enzymes and chromogenic reagents. As the small targets in the blood sample enter the sensing region to trigger a chromogenic reaction, the resulting color signal is recorded by a smartphone. The interference from the red blood to the color signal can be completely avoided without the requirement of any separation process. The analytical performance of the method is evaluated by assaying glucose in real blood samples. The results show that rapid and accurate analysis can be achieved with the limit of detection as low as 0.12 mM. In addition, simultaneous detection of different targets (glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides) in whole blood can be achieved by fabricating <i>c</i>-PAD with multiple sensing regions. Owing to its several essential advantages including an extremely simple procedure for fabrication, sample-to-answer analysis without tedious pretreatment, and capability to perform high-throughput analysis, the proposed <i>c-</i>PAD will be of great value in POCT applications of whole blood samples.",2021,Analytical chemistry,No keywords,"Colorimetry, Hydrogels, Paper, Plasma, Point-of-Care Testing",10.1021/acs.analchem.1c03347,"Key Laboratory of Nanobiosensing and Nanobioanalysis at Universities of Jilin Province, Department of Chemistry, Northeast Normal University, 5268 Renmin Street, Changchun, Jilin130024, China., Key Laboratory of Nanobiosensing and Nanobioanalysis at Universities of Jilin Province, Department of Chemistry, Northeast Normal University, 5268 Renmin Street, Changchun, Jilin130024, China., Key Laboratory of Nanobiosensing and Nanobioanalysis at Universities of Jilin Province, Department of Chemistry, Northeast Normal University, 5268 Renmin Street, Changchun, Jilin130024, China."
'I just need to know what they are and if you can help me': Medicalization and the search for legitimacy in people diagnosed with non-epileptic attack disorder.,"Marian Peacock, Paul Bissell, Julie Ellis, Jon M Dickson, Alistair Wardrope, Richard Grünewald, Markus Reuber","This paper focuses on the struggles for legitimacy expressed by people with non-epileptic attack disorder (NEAD), one of the most common manifestations of functional neurological disorder presenting to emergency and secondary care services. Nonepileptic attacks are episodes of altered experience, awareness, and reduced self-control that superficially resemble epileptic seizures or other paroxysmal disorders but are not associated with physiological abnormalities sufficient to explain the semiological features. ""Organic"" or medicalized explanations are frequently sought by patients as the only legitimate explanation for symptoms, and consequently, a diagnosis of NEAD is often contested. Drawing on narrative interviews with patients from a small exploratory study and using a sociological perspective, we propose that a psychological account of NEAD does not provide a sufficiently legitimate path into a socially sanctioned sick role. This is a reflection of the dominance of biomedicine and the associated processes of medicalization. These processes are, we argue, the sole route to achieving legitimacy. The stress-based or psychologically oriented explanations offered to patients in contemporary medical models of the etiology of NEAD engender an uncertain identity and social position and fail to provide many patients with an account of the nature or origin of their symptoms that they find satisfactory or convincing. These struggles for legitimacy (shared by others with functional or somatoform conditions) are sharpened by key features of the contemporary healthcare landscape, such as the increasing framing of health through a lens of 'responsibilization'.",2023,Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,"Functional seizures, Legitimacy, Medicalization, Non-epileptic attack disorder (NEAD)","Humans, Medicalization, Seizures, Epilepsy",10.1016/j.yebeh.2023.109485,"Edge Hill University, Faculty of Health, Social Care & Medicine, St Helens Road, Ormskirk L39 4QP, UK.

Paper test cards for presumptive testing of very low quality antimalarial medications.,"Abigail A Weaver, Marya Lieberman","Carrying out chemical analysis of antimalarials to detect low-quality medications before they reach a patient is a costly venture. Here, we show that a library of chemical color tests embedded on a paper card can presumptively identify formulations corresponding to very low quality antimalarial drugs. The presence or absence of chloroquine (CQ), doxycycline (DOX), quinine, sulfadoxine, pyrimethamine, and primaquine antimalarial medications, in addition to fillers used in low-quality pharmaceuticals, are indicated by patterns of colors that are generated on the test cards. Test card sensitivity for detection of these pure components ranges from 90% to 100% with no false positives in the absence of pharmaceutical. The color intensities from reactions characteristic of CQ or DOX allowed visual detection of formulations of these medications cut with 60% or 100% filler, although samples cut with 30% filler could not be reliably detected colorimetrically. However, the addition of unexpected fillers, even in 30% quantities, or substitute pharmaceuticals, could sometimes be detected by other color reactions on the test cards.

From distress to illness: a critical analysis of medicalization and its effects in clinical practice.,"J D Jacob, M Gagnon, J McCabe","This paper is precisely aimed at exposing the limits of psychiatry's scientific claim-making and exploring how psychiatric diagnoses come to be utilized in practice and affect those who become pathologized. Drawing on research findings in the field of HIV/AIDS nursing, we portray the impact of psychiatric pathologization of women who see their bodies transformed by antiretroviral therapy and subsequently, must accept that their response to these changes become the target of psychiatric labelling and interventions. In this paper, we therefore engage with the reader in a critical analysis that exposes the tensions that exist between individual experiences of distress and psychiatric pathologization. The first section of the paper is dedicated to the presentation of a theoretical framework in which we explore the medicalization process and the ontological issues regarding psychiatric diagnoses. The second section seeks to present the results from a qualitative research study in the field of HIV/AIDS nursing and serves as a case example to foster discussions on the implications of psychiatric pathologization in clinical practice.",2013,Journal of psychiatric and mental health nursing,"HIV/AIDS, medicalization, nursing, pathologization, psychiatry, women","Adult, Female, HIV Infections, Humans, Medicalization, Mental Disorders, Qualitative Research",10.1111/jpm.12078,"School of Nursing, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON."
The impending globalization of ADHD: notes on the expansion and growth of a medicalized disorder.,"Peter Conrad, Meredith R Bergey","Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) has been medicalized in the United States since the 1960s. Primarily used in North America until the 1990s, ADHD diagnosis and treatment have increasingly been applied internationally. After documenting the expansion of ADHD in a global context, this paper presents five brief international examples examining ADHD usage and expansion: the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy and Brazil. We then identify and describe several vehicles that facilitate the migration of the ADHD diagnosis: the transnational pharmaceutical industry; the influence of western psychiatry; moving from ICD to DSM diagnostic criteria; the role of the Internet including the related advent of easily accessible online screening checklists; and advocacy groups. Finally, we discuss what this globalization of a diagnosis reflects about the potential global medicalization of other conditions.",2014,Social science & medicine (1982),"ADHD, DSM, Diagnosis, Globalization, ICD, Medicalization","Adolescent Psychiatry, Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity, Brazil, Child Psychiatry, Consumer Health Information, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Drug Industry, Europe, Global Health, Health Education, Humans, International Classification of Diseases, Internet, Medicalization, Social Environment, United States",10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.10.019,"Department of Sociology, MS-71, Brandeis University, Waltham, MA 02454-9110, USA.

The use of subcutaneous infusion in medication administration.,Janice Gabriel,"The subcutaneous administration of medications is an area that receives little attention compared with other types of parenteral therapy. Parenteral administration is used by many thousands of patients who self-administer their medication on a daily basis-for example, those using insulin to manage diabetes, recipients of some types of hormone therapy and so on. It is also an effective route for the continuous administration of medication(s) in individuals who are terminally ill. Patients approaching the end of their life may be unable to tolerate the administration of oral medication to control their symptoms and make them more comfortable. This paper will discuss how subcutaneous infusion can be used to deliver these medications, but at the same time how important the selection of the most appropriate subcutaneous infusion device is to the overall comfort of the patient, and to reduce the potential for sharps-related injuries to healthcare workers. Appropriate device selection, together with its management, is an important contributing factor to patient safety and comfort. It will diminish the potential for premature device loss, which can lead to repeated insertion procedures for the patient, as well as delaying their medication. There is also a resource implication for the NHS, as the replacement of any device involves the use of additional equipment and staff time. Additionally, the use of any infusion device poses a risk to healthcare workers of acquiring a bloodborne infection should they experience a percutaneous injury. Knowledge of what equipment is available will reduce the potential risk to these staff.",No date available,British journal of nursing (Mark Allen Publishing),No keywords,"Humans, Infusions, Subcutaneous, Needlestick Injuries, Occupational Injuries, Palliative Care, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Risk Factors, United Kingdom",No DOI available,"NHS England, Wessex."

Chronic relationships and mental health care: global pharmaceuticals in a local healing shrine in India.,Shubha Ranganathan,"The paper explores how chronicities and chronic relationships are fostered at a state-sponsored community psychiatry clinic that has been affiliated with a Sufi shrine in western India. The clinic provides free psychotropic treatment to patients, most of whom are pilgrims visiting the shrine. While the clinic has been lauded for its collaborative approach of blending 'medicine and prayer' in the provision of mental health care, observations of clinical encounters reflect the prevalence of a strongly medicalized perspective of mental illness, where local narratives of distress are reframed as globalized categories of mental disorder, thereby permitting pharmacological intervention. Importantly, in a context where free medicines are offered just as other freebies are in development initiatives in India, this results in the creation of long-term, 'chronic' relationships with patients who only seem to return for medicines, never recovering. This paper illustrates how 'chronicity', in many ways, is built into the project from the beginning itself. It becomes evident in the assumptions of the officials and psychiatrists that mental illness is chronic, in the case files of patients that record their consultation and medication histories, and in the clinical conversations about the importance of compliance to treatment. Given that historically, community mental health emerged in the context of reducing long hospital stays and deinstitutionalizing mental health care, it is important to reflect on how these policies and practices result in the creation of a cadre of chronic out-patients.",2023,Anthropology & medicine,"Chronicities, care, pharmaceuticals, ritual, somatization","Humans, Mental Health, Anthropology, Medical, Mental Disorders, Psychiatry, Pharmaceutical Preparations, India",10.1080/13648470.2023.2212212,"Department of Liberal Arts, Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad, Sangareddy, India."
Integration of mental health into primary healthcare in low-income countries: avoiding medicalization.,Peter Ventevogel,"Since 2008 the World Health Organization (WHO), through its mental health Gap Action Programme, has attempted to revitalize efforts to integrate mental health into non-specialized (e.g. primary) healthcare. While this has led to renewed interest in this potential method of mental health service delivery, it has also prompted criticism. Some concerns raised are that it would contribute to the medicalization of social and psychological problems, and narrowly focus on primary care without sufficient attention given to strengthening other levels of the healthcare system, notably community-based care and care on district levels. This paper discusses seven elements that may be critical to preventing inadvertently contributing to increasing a narrow biomedical approach to mental healthcare when integrating mental health into non-specialized healthcare: (1) using task shifting approaches within a system of stepped care, (2) ensuring primary mental healthcare also includes brief psychotherapeutic interventions, (3) promote community-based recovery-oriented interventions for people with disabling chronic mental disorders, (4) conceptualizing training as a continuous process of strengthening clinical competencies through supervision, (5) engaging communities as partners in psychosocial interventions, (6) embedding shifts to primary mental healthcare within wider health policy reforms, and (7) promoting inter-sectoral approaches to address social determinants of mental health.",No date available,"International review of psychiatry (Abingdon, England)",No keywords,"Delivery of Health Care, Integrated, Developing Countries, Humans, Medicalization, Mental Health Services, Primary Health Care",10.3109/09540261.2014.966067,"UNHCR Geneva , Switzerland."

Trace evidence dynamics of cocaine on banknotes: A comparison study of paper and polymer banknotes.,"M A Amaral, A P Gibson, R M Morgan","It is well established that a large proportion of paper banknotes in circulation contain traces of cocaine. Being able to discriminate between the innocent transfer of illicit drug particles acquired through everyday interactions with surfaces such as banknotes, as opposed to transfer resulting from criminal activities can provide valuable intelligence that can inform an investigation. With many countries adopting polymer banknotes as legal tender, it is important to consider the transfer of cocaine from these surfaces as well as the retention of these particulates on polymer banknotes for evaluative interpretation in crime reconstruction. This comparison study assessed three contact variables (force, time, and rotation) on the transfer of cocaine particulates from paper and polymer banknotes onto a human skin proxy. The persistence of cocaine particulates was assessed through a realistic scenario which mimicked a cash transaction. Quantifiable amounts of cocaine were transferred onto the human skin proxy across all of the contacts assessed, with a greater transfer observed with contacts involving polymer banknotes and those contacts which involved rotation. Following extensive handling, cocaine persisted on both banknote types, with paper banknotes retaining larger amounts of cocaine than polymer banknotes. These findings show that cocaine can persist on both paper and polymer banknotes for extended periods of time following handling and is therefore available for transfer. This transfer then readily occurs, even when contact is brief and involves relatively small forces. A key distinction between the banknote types was that cocaine particulates are more likely to transfer from polymer banknotes due to the lower retention rate of particulates on this surface. Such insights can aid in evaluating the relevance of illicit drug particles identified on items or persons of interest in crime reconstruction approaches.",2022,Science & justice : journal of the Forensic Science Society,"Crime reconstruction, Experimental studies, Forensic science, Instron ElectroPuls, Persistence, Transfer","Cocaine, Humans, Illicit Drugs, Paper, Polymers",10.1016/j.scijus.2022.02.008,"Department of Security and Crime Science, University College London, 35 Tavistock Square, London WC1H 9EZ, United Kingdom; Centre for the Forensic Sciences, University College London, 35 Tavistock Square, London WC1H 9EZ, United Kingdom; Department of Medical Physics & Biomedical Engineering, University College London, Gower Street, London WC1E 6BT, United Kingdom.

[The medicalization of life: hybrids against the dichotomy Nature/Culture].,Anahi Sy,"This paper aims to analyze the process of medicalization in current societies, starting from the description of the way in which medicine gradually appropriated various aspects of everyday life that were once part of the life cycle of people. At the theoretical level, we are based on authors such as Descola and Latour, who problematize the dichotomy between Nature and Culture, and propose the need to think from a superior episteme. Methodologically, this theoretical proposal enables an analysis of the medicalization that can illuminate what is hidden in the discourse and biomedical practices: the sociocultural, political and economic processes that are part of these ""objects"" of Medicine. From this perspective, the presentation of them as scientific facts, objectively isolatable and manipulable by medical science, is in crisis.

Paper-based microreactor array for rapid screening of cell signaling cascades.,"Chia-Hao Huang, Kin Fong Lei, Ngan-Ming Tsang","Investigation of cell signaling pathways is important for the study of pathogenesis of cancer. However, the related operations used in these studies are time consuming and labor intensive. Thus, the development of effective therapeutic strategies may be hampered. In this work, gel-free cell culture and subsequent immunoassay has been successfully integrated and conducted in a paper-based microreactor array. Study of the activation level of different kinases of cells stimulated by different conditions, i.e., IL-6 stimulation, starvation, and hypoxia, was demonstrated. Moreover, rapid screening of cell signaling cascades after the stimulations of HGF, doxorubicin, and UVB irradiation was respectively conducted to simultaneously screen 40 kinases and transcription factors. Activation of multi-signaling pathways could be identified and the correlation between signaling pathways was discussed to provide further information to investigate the entire signaling network. The present technique integrates most of the tedious operations using a single paper substrate, reduces sample and reagent consumption, and shortens the time required by the entire process. Therefore, it provides a first-tier rapid screening tool for the study of complicated signaling cascades.

Janus Electrochemical Paper-Based Analytical Devices for Metals Detection in Aerosol Samples.,"Jaruwan Mettakoonpitak, John Volckens, Charles S Henry","Exposure to trace metals in airborne particulate matter (PM) has been linked to various adverse health effects. Quantifying metals in PM is important; however, current analytical tools tend to be bulky and expensive. A need therefore exists for more rapid, low-cost, portable tools for multiplexed determination of metals in PM. Electrochemical paper-based devices (ePADs) have been used for detecting metals in PM but require different devices and methods for different metals, making the systems more complicated than desired. Recently reported Janus ePADs offer a solution to this problem by allowing for multiple electrochemical experiments from a single sample. Here, we sought to determine if a Janus ePAD containing four independent channels and working electrodes could be used for simultaneous detection of multiple metals in PM. Online sample pretreatment in each channel during sample delivery yielded optimal conditions for each experiment. The design allows the device to conduct square-wave anodic stripping voltammetry (SWASV) and square-wave cathodic stripping voltammetry (SWCSV) for simultaneous detection of Cd, Pb, Cu, Fe, and Ni from a single sample. Two detection zones each with shared reference and counter electrodes were used for SWASV and SWCSV, respectively. The proposed sensors reached LODs down to 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, and 1.0 μg L<sup>-1</sup>, for Cd(II), Pb(II), Cu(II), Fe(II), and Ni(II), respectively. The linear working ranges were 0.5-400.0 μg L<sup>-1</sup> for Cd(II), Pb(II), and Fe(II), 1.0-400.0 μg L<sup>-1</sup> for Cu(II), and 0.5-200.0 μg L<sup>-1</sup> for Ni(II).

Chemical and statistical analyses of blotter paper matrix drugs seized in the State of Rio de Janeiro.,"Vinícius L Meira, Adriana S de Oliveira, Luciana S A Cohen, Cecília de A Bhering, Karen M de Oliveira, Denilson S de Siqueira, Marco Antônio Martins de Oliveira, Francisco R de Aquino Neto, Gabriela Vanini","Drugs of abuse are psychoactive substances illicitly distributed and used worldwide. In Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, they represent a public health issue and are directly related to several social problems. The recent increase in appearances of new psychoactive substances (NPS), derived from structural modifications of existing psychoactive substances, poses a threat to public health and forensic laboratories worldwide, as little is known about these substances. This study aimed to chemically and geographically map drugs of abuse from blotter papers seized by the Civil Police of Rio de Janeiro State (PCERJ) between 2006 and 2019. High-performance analytical techniques, such as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and Orbitrap mass spectrometry (Orbitrap-MS), combined with statistical analyses, were employed to characterize the seized samples. The most common chemical compounds in NPS found in this study were synthetic phenethylamines, i.e., molecules from the 25I-NBOH (2-(((4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethyl)amino)methyl)phenol) and 25I-NBOMe (2-(4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)ethanamine) families. Prior to 2014, the majority of seized blotter papers contained lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and were concentrated in the Metropolitan region. An upsurge in blotter paper seizures was observed from 2014 to 2017; the most common substances during this time were from the NBOMe family. NBOH compounds emerged in 2016 in coastal regions with high tourism, reaching over 1300 items only in 2017. Only one synthetic cannabinoid was found among the blotter papers seized in Rio de Janeiro between 2006 and 2019.

A strategy for the detection of benzodiazepine drugs using low-resolution paper-spray mass spectrometry for harm reduction drug checking.,"Allie Miskulin, Bruce Wallace, Chris Gill, Dennis Hore","The ability to detect newly emerging substances is of great importance in reducing harms for people who use drugs. New psychoactive substances including novel benzodiazepines in the illicit drug supply have been linked to high rates of overdose deaths while complicating drug checking as an overdose prevention strategy. Paper-spray mass spectrometry (PS-MS) has emerged as a novel strategy to rapidly detect trace components in street drug samples. While targeted, low-resolution PS-MS methods have proven effective, newly emerging substances are often missed. To address this, a method was applied to low-resolution full-scan PS-MS data to aid in the early detection and identification of novel benzodiazepines in the unregulated drug supply. Using the developed method, true positives rates of 0.89 and 0.75 were achieved for bromazolam and etizolam in street samples obtained in a community drug checking service. The applicability of the method was further demonstrated for a novel benzodiazepine, desalkylgidazepam, that has recently emerged in the illicit drug supply.",2023,Drug testing and analysis,"drug checking, paper‐spray mass spectrometry, point‐of‐care","Benzodiazepines, Humans, Illicit Drugs, Mass Spectrometry, Paper, Substance Abuse Detection, Harm Reduction",10.1002/dta.3630,"Department of Chemistry, University of Victoria, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada., School of Social Work, University of Victoria, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada., Department of Chemistry, University of Victoria, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada., Department of Chemistry, University of Victoria, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada."

"Defending the indefensible? Psychiatry, assisted suicide and human freedom.",Malcolm Parker,"The siege guns of the forces for change to euthanasia and assisted suicide laws have been pounding for decades, but the longstanding proscription on these practices has held out in all but a few jurisdictions. A few psychiatrists have enlisted with the challengers, but many remain on the battlements, defending the impermissibility of active assistance in dying. Given the long history of the separation of church and state and the significant secularisation of society; the recognition by the law of both acts and omissions as legal causes; lenient sentences for mercy killers; critiques of the ""psychiatriatisation"" of different aspects of life; and the consistency of public opinion, this recalcitrant stand bespeaks undercurrents and positions that are often by rationalised or camouflaged, and which call for exploration. In this paper, I examine connections between psychiatry and conceptualisations of harm, suffering and natural death; medicalisation, psychiatrisation and medical paternalism; decision-making capacity, rationality and diagnosis; recent legal developments; social pluralism; and religious intuitionism. I conclude that psychiatrists and the psychiatry profession, concerned as they are with enlarging the province of human freedom, should begin a more transparent rapprochement with those they would repel.",2013,International journal of law and psychiatry,"Acts and omissions, Euthanasia, Freedom, Medicalisation, Psychiatry, Religion","Humans, Medicalization, Pain, Personal Autonomy, Psychiatry, Stress, Psychological, Suicide, Assisted",10.1016/j.ijlp.2013.06.007,"Mayne Medical School, 288 Herston Road, Herston, Queensland 4006, Australia; School of Medicine, University of Queensland, Australia.

Terahertz-spectroscopy for non-destructive determination of crystallinity of L-tartaric acid in smartFilms® and tablets made from paper.,"Jan Ornik, Daniel Knoth, Martin Koch, Cornelia M Keck","Newly developed active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) often experience low solubility in aqueous media and thus possess poor oral bioavailability. The SmartFilm®-technology is a novel approach to overcome poor solubility. The technique uses commercial paper in which API can be loaded in amorphous state, thus increasing dissolution rate dc/dt and solubility c<sub>s</sub> when compared to bulk material. However, the preservation of the amorphous state is a prerequisite for an efficient use of the smartFilm-technology and thus the crystalline state needs to be inspected during storage. Preferably, this should be done non-destructively. Traditional techniques, such as x-ray diffraction (XRD) or differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), do not allow for non-destructive crystallinity investigations, whereas Terahertz (THz) spectroscopy is a non-destructive technique, that is sensitive to the crystalline state of many molecular crystals. Therefore, the potential of THz-spectroscopy for crystallinity state inspection of API in smartFilms and tablets made from smartFilms was investigated in this study. The THz results obtained were compared to results obtained from XRD and DSC measurements. Whereas DSC measurements failed to reliably detect crystalline API in the smartFilms, XRD and THz-spectroscopy showed similar results and revealed that it was possible to prepare smartFilms loaded with >23% (w/w) amorphous API.

Validation and enhancement of a computable medication indication resource (MEDI) using a large practice-based dataset.,"Wei-Qi Wei, Jonathan D Mosley, Lisa Bastarache, Joshua C Denny","Linking medications with their indications is important for clinical care and research. We have recently developed a freely-available, computable medication-indication resource, called MEDI, which links RxNorm medications to indications mapped to ICD9 codes. In this paper, we identified the medications and diagnoses for 1.3 million individuals at Vanderbilt University Medical Center to evaluate the medication coverage of MEDI and then to calculate the prevalence for each indication for each medication. Our results demonstrated MEDI covered 97.3% of medications recorded in medical records. The ""high precision subset"" of MEDI covered 93.8% of recorded medications. No significant prescription drugs were missed by MEDI. Manual physician review of random patient records for four example medications found that the MEDI covered the observed indications, and confirmed the estimated prevalence of these medications using practice information. Indication prevalence information for each medication, previously unavailable in other public resources, may improve the clinical usability of MEDI. We believe MEDI will be useful for both clinical informatics and to aid in recognition of phenotypes for electronic medical record-based research.",2013,AMIA ... Annual Symposium proceedings.

"Bismuth-Based, Disposable Sensor for the Detection of Hydrogen Sulfide Gas.","Samuel M Rosolina, Thomas S Carpenter, Zi-Ling Xue","A new sensor for the detection of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas has been developed to replace commercial lead(II) acetate-based test papers. The new sensor is a wet, porous, paper-like substrate coated with Bi(OH)3 or its alkaline derivatives at pH 11. In contrast to the neurotoxic lead(II) acetate, bismuth is used due to its nontoxic properties, as Bi(III) has been a reagent in medications such as Pepto-Bismol. The reaction between H2S gas and the current sensor produces a visible color change from white to yellow/brown, and the sensor responds to ≥ 30 ppb H2S in a total volume of 1.35 L of gas, a typical volume of human breath. The alkaline, wet coating helps the trapping of acidic H2S gas and its reaction with Bi(III) species, forming colored Bi2S3. The sensor is suitable for testing human bad breath and is at least 2 orders of magnitude more sensitive than a commercial H2S test paper based on Pb(II)(acetate)2. The small volume of 1.35-L H2S is important, as the commercial Pb(II)(acetate)2-based paper requires large volumes of 5 ppm H2S gas. The new sensor reported here is inexpensive, disposable, safe, and user-friendly. A simple, laboratory setup for generating small volumes of ppb-ppm of H2S gas is also reported.",2016,Analytical chemistry,No keywords,"Bismuth, Environmental Monitoring, Gases, Humans, Hydrogen Sulfide, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Paper, Particle Size, Porosity, Surface Properties",10.1021/acs.analchem.5b04489,"Department of Chemistry, University of Tennessee , Knoxville, Tennessee 37996, United States., Department of Chemistry, University of Tennessee , Knoxville, Tennessee 37996, United States., Department of Chemistry, University of Tennessee , Knoxville, Tennessee 37996, United States."

Analysing the ethics of breast cancer overdiagnosis: a pathogenic vulnerability.,Wendy A Rogers,"Breast cancer screening aims to help women by early identification and treatment of cancers that might otherwise be life-threatening. However, breast cancer screening also leads to the detection of some cancers that, if left undetected and untreated, would not have damaged the health of the women concerned. At the time of diagnosis, harmless cancers cannot be identified as non-threatening, therefore women are offered invasive breast cancer treatment. This phenomenon of identifying (and treating) non-harmful cancers is called overdiagnosis. Overdiagnosis is morally problematic as it leads to overall patient harm rather than benefit. Further, breast cancer screening is offered in a context that exaggerates cancer risk and screening benefit, minimises risk of harm and impedes informed choice. These factors combine to create pathogenic vulnerability. That is, breast cancer screening exacerbates rather than reduces women's vulnerability and undermines women's agency. This paper provides an original way of conceptualising agency-supporting responses to the harms of breast cancer overdiagnosis through application of the concept of pathogenic vulnerability.",No date available,"Medicine, health care, and philosophy","Breast cancer, Ethics, Harm, Overdiagnosis, Pathogenic vulnerability, Screening, Vulnerability","Breast Neoplasms, Early Detection of Cancer, Female, Humans, Mass Screening, Medical Overuse, Medicalization, Preventive Medicine, Unnecessary Procedures, Women's Health",10.1007/s11019-018-9852-z,"Department of Philosophy and Department of Clinical Medicine, Macquarie University, North Ryde, NSW, 2107, Australia. wendy.rogers@mq.edu.au."
Drug data coding and analysis in epidemiologic studies.,"M Pahor, E A Chrischilles, J M Guralnik, S L Brown, R B Wallace, P Carbonin","In epidemiologic studies that collect comprehensive information on medication use, the complexity of dealing with a large number of trade and generic names may limit the utilization of these data bases.

Disconnectedness from the here-and-now: a phenomenological perspective as a counteract on the medicalisation of death wishes in elderly people.,"Els van Wijngaarden, Carlo Leget, Anne Goossensen","When elderly people are ideating on manners to end their lives, because they feel life is over and no longer worth living, it is important to understand their lived experiences, thoughts and behaviour in order to appropriately align care, support and policy to the needs of these people. In the literature, the wish to die in elderly people is often understood from a medical, psychopathological paradigm, referred to as cognitive impairment, depressive disorder, pathological bereavement, and suicidality. In this paper, we evaluate this dominant paradigm by considering three serious limitations, namely: (1) the risk of epistemic transformation; (2) the risk of reduction; and (3) the risk of obscuring the social and cultural embeddedness.

DNA Tetrahedra-Cross-linked Hydrogel Functionalized Paper for Onsite Analysis of DNA Methyltransferase Activity Using a Personal Glucose Meter.,"Xin Gao, Xiuyuan Li, Xinzhi Sun, Jingyan Zhang, Yuecan Zhao, Xiaojuan Liu, Feng Li","Despite the recent developments on the construction of point-of-care testing (POCT) devices, it is still a big challenge to build portable POCT tools for simple, sensitive, selective, and quantitative determination of disease-related biomarkers. With this in mind, we developed a simple and user-friendly POCT tool for onsite analysis of DNA adenine methyltransferase (Dam) activity by using DNA tetrahedra-based hydrogel to trap glucose-producing enzymes for target recognition and signal transduction. The enzyme-encapsulated DNA hydrogel and the substrate of enzyme were separately modified on papers and then combined onto a commercial glucose test strip for the sensitive evaluation of Dam activity via using a personal glucose meter (PGM) for quantitative signal readout. Taking advantage of the great amount of enzyme entrapped in DNA hydrogel and the high signal amplification ability of enzyme, this POCT tool is capable of highly sensitive and selective determination of Dam activity with a direct detection limit down to 0.001 U/mL, which is superior to that of most previously reported biosensors. Furthermore, this device can also be applied to screen inhibitor and analyze Dam activity in spiked serum samples, indicating the great potential for clinical practice and diagnostic applications. Additionally, all the reactions for Dam assay are performed on paper, which is simple and deliverable to end-users for medical diagnostics at home or in-field.",2020,Analytical chemistry,No keywords,"Blood Glucose, Blood Glucose Self-Monitoring, Cross-Linking Reagents, DNA, Humans, Hydrogels, Paper, Particle Size, Point-of-Care Testing, Site-Specific DNA-Methyltransferase (Adenine-Specific), Surface Properties",10.1021/acs.analchem.0c00018,"College of Chemistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Qingdao Agricultural University, Qingdao 266109, P.

Drug contamination of US paper currency.,A J Jenkins,"It is known that US paper currency in the general circulation is contaminated with cocaine. Several mechanisms have been offered to explain this finding, including contamination due to handling during drug deals and the use of rolled up bills for snorting. Drug is then transferred from one contaminated bill to others during counting in financial institutions. The possibility of contamination of currency with other drugs has not been reported. In this study, the author reports the analysis of 10 randomly collected US$ 1 bills from five cities, for cocaine, heroin, 6-acetylmorphine (6-AM), morphine, codeine, methamphetamine, amphetamine and phencyclidine (PCP). Bills were immersed in acetonitrile for 2h prior to extraction and GC-MS analysis. Results showed that 92% of the bills were positive for cocaine with a mean amount of 28.75+/-139.07 microg per bill, a median of 1.37 microg per bill, and a range of 0.01-922.72 microg per bill. Heroin was detected in seven bills in amounts ranging from 0.03 to 168.50 microg per bill: 6-AM and morphine were detected in three bills; methamphetamine and amphetamine in three and one bills, respectively, and PCP was detected in two bills in amounts of 0.78 and 1.87 microg per bill. Codeine was not detected in any of the US$ 1 bills analyzed.

A tutorial translation of the description of the historically first polymer drug conjugate and its in vivo evaluation.,Robert Luxenhofer,"Preamble Polymer-drug conjugates have been intensively investigated for several decades, and even though their clinical success still lags behind the promise many researchers have placed in them, they are a mainstay in the fields of polymer therapeutics or nanomedicine. For many in the field, the seminal perspective paper by Helmut Ringsdorf from 1975 marks the beginning of this field of research. With more than one thousand citations, this paper has indubitably affected and inspired generations of researchers in the field, including the author of this translation. However, it is not the first paper describing the concept of polymer-drug conjugates. Some twenty years earlier, Horst Jatzkewitz described in two outstanding articles probably the historically first polymer-drug conjugates, detailed its synthesis, characterization and even first in vivo experiments. The results, carefully re-interpreted through the eyes of a scientist of the 21st century, clearly highlight several issues that need to be taken into consideration when designing polymer-drug conjugates. However, despite the pioneering nature of this paper, it is all but forgotten by the scientific community. In the author's opinion, Horst Jatzkewitz and these papers clearly did not receive the attention and praise they deserve. Whether this was because these paper were much ahead of it´s time, or because it was published in German language, or for some other reason, we cannot know. However, these papers are, in my opinion, an excellent piece of work that should be known more widely and available to students and experts world-wide, which is why the author decided to translate it. Also, to give some more context and to help understand some outdated terms or concepts, additional comments and explanations are added throughout. I hope that this will help for these papers to receive the attention I believe they deserve.",No date available,"Zeitschrift fur Naturforschung.

Microfluidic paper-based analytical device for particulate metals.,"Mallory M Mentele, Josephine Cunningham, Kirsten Koehler, John Volckens, Charles S Henry","A microfluidic paper-based analytical device (μPAD) fabricated by wax printing was designed to assess occupational exposure to metal-containing aerosols. This method employs rapid digestion of particulate metals using microliters of acid added directly to a punch taken from an air sampling filter. Punches were then placed on a μPAD, and digested metals were transported to detection reservoirs upon addition of water. These reservoirs contained reagents for colorimetric detection of Fe, Cu, and Ni. Dried buffer components were used to set the optimal pH in each detection reservoir, while precomplexation agents were deposited in the channels between the sample and detection zones to minimize interferences from competing metals. Metal concentrations were quantified from color intensity images using a scanner in conjunction with image processing software. Reproducible, log-linear calibration curves were generated for each metal, with method detection limits ranging from 1.0 to 1.5 μg for each metal (i.e., total mass present on the μPAD). Finally, a standard incineration ash sample was aerosolized, collected on filters, and analyzed for the three metals of interest. Analysis of this collected aerosol sample using a μPAD showed good correlation with known amounts of the metals present in the sample.

Lateral Flow Assay Based on Paper-Hydrogel Hybrid Material for Sensitive Point-of-Care Detection of Dengue Virus.,"Jane Ru Choi, Kar Wey Yong, Ruihua Tang, Yan Gong, Ting Wen, Hui Yang, Ang Li, Yook Chin Chia, Belinda Pingguan-Murphy, Feng Xu","Paper-based devices have been broadly used for the point-of-care detection of dengue viral nucleic acids due to their simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and readily observable colorimetric readout. However, their moderate sensitivity and functionality have limited their applications. Despite the above-mentioned advantages, paper substrates are lacking in their ability to control fluid flow, in contrast to the flow control enabled by polymer substrates (e.g., agarose) with readily tunable pore size and porosity. Herein, taking the benefits from both materials, the authors propose a strategy to create a hybrid substrate by incorporating agarose into the test strip to achieve flow control for optimal biomolecule interactions. As compared to the unmodified test strip, this strategy allows sensitive detection of targets with an approximately tenfold signal improvement. Additionally, the authors showcase the potential of functionality improvement by creating multiple test zones for semi-quantification of targets, suggesting that the number of visible test zones is directly proportional to the target concentration. The authors further demonstrate the potential of their proposed strategy for clinical assessment by applying it to their prototype sample-to-result test strip to sensitively and semi-quantitatively detect dengue viral RNA from the clinical blood samples.

"Lower-dose prescribing: minimizing ""side effects"" of pharmaceuticals on society and the environment.","Christian G Daughton, Ilene Sue Ruhoy","The prescribed use of pharmaceuticals can result in unintended, unwelcomed, and potentially adverse consequences for the environment and for those not initially targeted for treatment. Medication usage frequently results in the collateral introduction to the environment (via excretion and bathing) of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), bioactive metabolites, and reversible conjugates. Imprudent prescribing and non-compliant patient behavior drive the accumulation of unused medications, which pose major public health risks from diversion as well as risks for the environment from unsound disposal, such as flushing to sewers. The prescriber has the unique wherewithal to reduce each of these risks by modifying various aspects of the practice of prescribing. By incorporating consideration of the potential for adverse environmental impacts into the practice of prescribing, patient care also could possibly be improved and public health better protected. Although excretion of an API is governed by its characteristic pharmacokinetics, this variable can be somewhat controlled by the prescriber in selecting APIs possessing environment-friendly excretion profiles and in selecting the lowest effective dose. This paper presents the first critical examination of the multi-faceted role of drug dose in reducing the ambient levels of APIs in the environment and in reducing the incidence of drug wastage, which ultimately necessitates disposal of leftovers. Historically, drug dose has been actively excluded from consideration in risk mitigation strategies for reducing ambient API levels in the environment. Personalized adjustment of drug dose also holds the potential for enhancing therapeutic outcomes while simultaneously reducing the incidence of adverse drug events and in lowering patient healthcare costs. Optimizing drug dose is a major factor in improving the sustainability of health care. The prescriber needs to be cognizant that the ""patient"" encompasses the environment and other ""bystanders,"" and that prescribed treatments can have unanticipated, collateral impacts that reach far beyond the healthcare setting.",2012,The Science of the total environment,No keywords,"Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Drug Prescriptions, Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions, Environmental Pollutants, Humans, Pharmaceutical Preparations",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.10.092,"Environmental Sciences Division, National Exposure Research Laboratory, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 944 East Harmon Avenue, Las Vegas, NV 89119, USA. daughton.christian@epa.gov"
Quantitative analysis of finasteride tablets dissolution content with non-isotopically labeled internal standard by paper spray ionization mass spectrometry.,"Yang Liu, Yanan Zhou, Yandong Dai, Zhuang Zhao, Lan He, Qingsheng Zhang","Paper spray ionization, one of the ambient mass spectrometry technologies, has been developed to characterize the content of drugs in various complex matrixes including urine, whole blood, dissolution solutions, and so on. An isotopically labeled compound as internal standard is often used in quantitative paper spray ionization experiments. But high cost and difficult to access impede the application of this type of internal standards. Application of non-isotopically labeled compounds as internal standards will make this technology more prevalent. In this paper, we explored the application of finasteride impurity as the internal standard in paper spray ionization-mass spectrometry to measure the dissolution content of finasteride tablets. The new method was optimized and the results were compared to those from high-performance liquid chromatography. The whole analysis time was several minutes and limit of detection for finasteride was around 4.8 ng/mL. The results from paper spray ionization-mass spectrometry were similar to those from high-performance liquid chromatography.

"'Sometimes, it's easier to write the prescription': physician and patient accounts of the reluctant medicalisation of sleeplessness.",Mairead Eastin Moloney,"The medicalisation of sleep is a rich and growing area of sociological interest. Previous research suggests that medicalisation is occurring within the context of physician office visits, but the inner workings remain unclear. This study is the first to provide perspectives on the office visit interaction from both sleepless patients (n = 27) and the physicians (n = 8) who treat them. Analyses of semi-structured qualitative interviews reveal that sleep-related conversations are typically patient-initiated in routine office visits. Physicians and patients conceptualised insomnia as a symptom of another issue (depression), an everyday problem of living (stress) or the result of a natural life process (aging). Lack of sleep was not necessarily linked to daytime impairment. Even though sleep aids were routinely requested and prescribed, patients and physicians consistently expressed attitudes of reluctance toward the use of sedative hypnotics. I call this a case of 'reluctant medicalisation' and highlight the liminal space between pathology and normalcy inhabited by patients and physicians. I also build on recent work acknowledging the dynamics between macro and micro levels of medicalisation and illustrate the influence of multilevel 'engines' (consumerism, biotechnology, managed care and physicians) in patients' and physicians' accounts.

Hormone treatment of children and adolescents with gender dysphoria: an ethical analysis.,Brendan S Abel,"In the context of transgender health, most people are not comfortable with allowing a twelve-year-old child with gender dysphoria to elect to undergo gender reassignment surgery. The likelihood is too high that the child would be unable to fully comprehend the scope of a decision that carries significant, permanent consequences, particularly because the decision to surgically change gender is based upon a conception of gender that can fluctuate during adolescent years. Conversely, however, most people would not contend that this fluidity is reason to wholly deny certain medical care such as hormonal treatments to transgender youth, a demographic with extremely high rates of violent behavior, self-harm, and suicide. This paper will explore ethical considerations to this emerging debate of what therapeutic options should be offered to transgender children and adolescents. Pediatric endocrinologists have been treating gender dysphoric adolescents with puberty-suppressing drugs and, to a lesser extent, with cross-sex hormone therapies for more than twenty years. Clinicians and thought leaders have mentioned ethical components of this emerging practice in the few cohort studies and clinical review articles about the subject. However, ethics have generally been a secondary consideration in the medical academic literature.

Analytical characterization of three hallucinogenic N-(2-methoxy)benzyl derivatives of the 2C-series of phenethylamine drugs.,"Dariusz Zuba, Karolina Sekuła","This publication reports analytical properties of three new hallucinogenic substances identified in blotter papers seized from the drug market, namely 25D-NBOMe [2-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylphenyl)-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)ethanamine], 25E-NBOMe [2-(4-ethyl-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)ethanamine] and 25G-NBOMe [2-(2,5-dimethoxy-3,4-dimethylphenyl)-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)ethanamine]. These substances are N-(2-methoxy)benzyl derivatives of the 2C-series of phenethylamine drugs. The applied procedure covered a variety of analytical methods, including gas chromatography with electron impact mass spectrometry (GC-EI-MS; without derivatization and after derivatization with trifluoroacetic anhydride (TFAA)), liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-QTOF-MS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which made it possible to identify the active components unequivocally. The GC-MS spectra of analyzed compounds were very similar, with dominant ions observed at m/z = 150, 121, and 91. The remaining ions were analogous to those observed for parent substances, namely 2C-D, 2C-E, 2C-G, but their intensities were low. Derivatization allowed determination of molecular masses of the investigated substances. Their exact masses and chemical formulas were confirmed by LC-QTOF-MS experiments and the fragmentation patterns of these compounds following ESI were determined. The tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) experiments confirmed that the studied substances were N-(2-methoxy)benzyl derivatives of the 2C-series compounds. Final elucidation of the structures was performed by NMR spectroscopy. The substances were also characterized by FTIR spectroscopy to corroborate the identity of the compounds.",2012,Drug testing and analysis,"NBOMe, blotter paper, hallucinogens, identification","Benzyl Compounds, Chromatography, Liquid, Designer Drugs, Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry, Hallucinogens, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Paper, Phenethylamines, Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization, Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared, Substance Abuse Detection",10.1002/dta.1397,"Institute of Forensic Research, Department of Forensic Toxicology, Kraków, Poland. dzuba@ies.krakow.pl"

The need for a concept-based medication vocabulary as an enabling infrastructure in health informatics.,"W D Sperzel, C A Broverman, J E Kapusnik-Uner, J M Schlesinger","Users of drug information typically focus their attention at different levels of description in different situations, such as medication ordering or dispensing. Computer systems utilizing drug information to support such activities must accommodate these multiple perspectives. This paper presents an approach to conceptualizing drug descriptions at multiple levels and outlines key features of an underlying information model that can serve as the basis for a concept-oriented medication vocabulary.

Sustainable Stability-Indicating spectra manipulations for the concurrent quantification of a novel Anti-COVID-19 drug and its active Metabolite: Green profile assessment.,"Michael Gamal Fawzy, Ebraam B Kamel","Millions of individuals have lost their lives and changed their routines as a direct consequence of exposure to the coronavirus (Covid-19). Molnupiravir (MOL) is an orally bioavailable tiny molecule antiviral prodrug that is effective for curing the coronavirus that produces serious acute respiratory disorder (SARS-CoV-2). Fully green-assessed stability-indicating simple spectrophotometric methods have been developed and fully validated as per ICH criteria. The potential impact of degradation products of drug components on the safety and efficacy of a medication's shelf life is likely to be negligible. The field of pharmaceutical analysis necessitates various stability testing under different conditions. The conduct of such inquiries affords the prospect of predicting the most probable routes of degradation and ascertaining the inherent stability characteristics of the active drugs. Consequently, a surge in demand arose for the creation of an analytical methodology that could consistently measure the degradation products and/or impurities that may be present in pharmaceuticals. Herein, five smart and simple spectrophotometric data manipulation techniques have been produced for the concurrent estimation of MOL and its active metabolite as its possible acid degradation product namely; N-hydroxycytidine (NHC). Structure confirmation of NHC build-up through IR, MS and NMR analyses. All current techniques verified linearity ranging from 10 to 150 μg/ml and 10-60 μg/ml for MOL and NHC, respectively. The limit of quantitation (LOQ) values were in the range of 4.21-9.59 μg/ml, while the limit of detection (LOD) values were ranging from 1.38 - 3.16 μg/ml. The current methods were evaluated in terms of greenness by four assessing methods and confirmed to be green. The significant novelty of these methods depends on their being the first environmentally soundness stability-indicating spectrophotometric approaches for the concurrent estimation of MOL and its active metabolite, NHC. Also, the preparation of purified NHC delivers significant cost savings, instead of purchasing an expensive ingredient. These smart methods were utilized for analyzing the pharmaceutical dosage form which may be of great benefit to the pharmaceutical market.",2023,"Spectrochimica acta.

Bridging papermaking and hydrogel production: Nanoparticle-loaded cellulosic hollow fibers with pitted walls as skeleton materials for multifunctional electromagnetic hydrogels.,"Zhongfei Yuan, Na Cheng, Jianqiang Li, Hongyang Yuan, Jianmin Peng, Xueren Qian, Yonghao Ni, Zhibin He, Jing Shen","Electromagnetic hydrogels have attracted significant attention due to their vast potential in soft robotics, biomedical engineering, and energy harvesting. To facilitate future commercialization via large-scale industrial processes, we present a facile concept that utilizes the specialized knowledge of papermaking to fabricate hydrogels with multifunctional electromagnetic properties. The principles of papermaking wet end chemistry, which involves the handling of interactions among cellulosic fibers, fines, polymeric additives, and other components in aqueous systems, serves as a key foundation for this concept. Notably, based on these principles, the versatile use of chemical additives in combination with cellulosic materials enables the tailored design of various products. Our methodology exploits the unique hierarchically pitted and hollow tube-like structures of papermaking grade cellulosic fibers with discernible pits, enabling the incorporation of magnetite nanoparticles through lumen loading. By combining microscale softwood-derived cellulosic fibers with additives, we achieve dynamic covalent interactions that transform the cellulosic fiber slurry into an impressive hydrogel. The cellulosic fibers act as a skeleton, providing structural support within the hydrogel framework and facilitating the dispersion of nanoparticles. In accordance with our concept, the typical hydrogel exhibits combined attributes, including electrical conductivity, self-healing properties, pH responsiveness, and dynamic rheologic behavior. Our approach not only yields hydrogels with interesting properties but also aligns with the forefront of advanced cellulosic material applications. These materials hold the promise in remote strain sensing devices, electromagnetic navigation systems, contactless toys, and flexible electronic devices. The concept and findings of the current work may shed light on materials innovation based on traditional pulp and paper processes.

Double-Color Lanthanide Metal-Organic Framework Based Logic Device and Visual Ratiometric Fluorescence Water Microsensor for Solid Pharmaceuticals.,"Long Yu, Qutong Zheng, Heng Wang, Chenxi Liu, Xiaoqing Huang, Yuxiu Xiao","Water is one of the most widespread impurities and contaminants for pharmaceuticals and chemical products. A simple, fast and reliable water assay method is of high significance for the pharmaceutical and chemical manufacturing industries. In this work, lanthanide metal-organic framework Eu-dipicolinic acid/2-aminophthalic acid (Eu-DPA/PTA-NH<sub>2</sub>) was prepared as a double-color ratiometric fluorescent water sensor, which shows ultrasensitive (limit of detection 0.01% v/v) and linear broad-range (0-100% v/v) response to water. An innovative analytical device based on a one-to-two logic gate was constructed by using the water content and the two fluorescence responses as the input and output signals, respectively. The direct analysis of water content can be achieved by the four output types, NOT (0, 1), PASS 0 (0, 0), PASS 1 (1, 1), and YES (1, 0). Importantly, the metal-organic framework (MOF)-loaded fiber paper was prepared as a microsensor, and a water assay tube was designed for rapid water detection of solid pharmaceuticals via ratiometric chromaticity, coupled with a portable visual determination device. The paper-based microsensor is response-rapid (20 s), long-term stable (at least 30 days), and can achieve the accurate (relative error <9.8%) visual assay of trace water in solid pharmaceuticals.

Qualitative and quantitative analysis of illicit drug mixtures on paper currency using Raman microspectroscopy.,"Kathryn Y Noonan, Melissa Beshire, Jason Darnell, Kimberley A Frederick","Measurement of illicit drugs on paper currency is of interest for evidentiary purposes in legal cases involving the drug trade. Current methods, primarily based on mass spectrometry, are destructive and prevent re-analysis of the evidence. This article details a method based on Raman microspectroscopy that is able to collect spectra from individual crystals on the surface of paper currency. Mixtures of isoxsuprine and norephedrine, which are non-pharmacologically active drug surrogates, as well as lidocaine and benzocaine, common excipients in street drugs, were doped in small quantities onto US currency. Significant fluorescence interference resulted from the underlying dollar bill. This work presents two methods for reducing the fluorescence background, photobleaching and background subtraction, which both worked well. Finally, a method for determining the percent composition of individual components in heterogeneous mixtures was developed by systematically sampling the surface of the dollar bill.

An examination of the medicalization trend in female genital cutting in Egypt: How does it relate to a girl's risk of being cut?,"Van Eekert Nina, Biegel Naomi, Gadeyne Sylvie, Van De Velde Sarah","Female Genital Cutting (FGC) is increasingly being performed by trained health professionals. International, national, and local institutions strongly oppose this medicalization trend, arguing that the involvement of health-care providers in the performance of FGC will counteract efforts to eliminate the practice. However, no empirical research to date has confirmed or refuted this claim. Therefore, it remains unclear how the medicalization of FGC relates to changes in the prevalence of the practice. In the current paper, we aim to fill this gap in the literature by examining the association between this medicalization trend and the risk of FGC. We focus on Egypt because of its high medicalization and prevalence rates and its unique history of FGC legislation. We performed a discrete-time event-history regression analysis combined with governorate fixed effects using the Egyptian Demographic Health Surveys from 2005, 2008, and 2014 (N = 49,273 daughters clustered within 29,810 mothers). Our results show that increasing medicalization rates coexist with decreasing prevalence rates. This effect is particularly pronounced in a context where a substantial number of cuts were medicalized (estimated at 40% and above). This effect is significantly more pronounced in higher educated mothers. Our study thus shows that the medicalization of FGC can coincide with decreasing prevalence rates of FGC. Medicalization of FGC may take place in a context where an awareness of the health hazards related to FGC is more pronounced, thereby also discouraging the practice as a whole. In addition, the medicalization of FGC may make the practice more individualized and therefore reduce the incentives for FGC.",2020,Social science & medicine (1982),"Egypt, Female circumcision, Female genital cutting, Female genital mutilation/cutting, Harm reduction, Health stratification, Medicalization, Social norm, Status symbol","Circumcision, Female, Egypt, Female, Humans, Medicalization, Mothers, Nuclear Family",10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113024,"Centre for Population, Family and Health, University of Antwerp, Belgium; International Centre for Reproductive Health, Ghent University, Belgium.

Detection of doxycycline hyclate and oxymetazoline hydrochloride in pharmaceutical preparations via spectrophotometry and microfluidic paper-based analytical device (μPADs).,"Jwan Oday Abdulsattar, Hind Hadi, Samantha Richardson, Alexander Iles, Nicole Pamme","There is growing demand for simple to operate, sensitive, on-site quantitative assays to investigate concentrations of drug molecules in pharmaceutical preparations for quality assurance. Here, we report on the development of two colorimetric analysis methods for the study the antibiotic doxycycline hyclate (DOX) and the nasal decongestant oxymetazoline hydrochloride (OXY), in solution as well as in their respective formulations. We compare a UV/vis spectrophotometry method with a color change recorded on a microfluidic paper-based analytical device (μPAD). Detection is based on the pharmaceutical compounds coupling with diazotized 4-aminoacetophenone (DAAP) under alkaline conditions to produce colored azo-dye products. These azo-compounds were monitored by absorbance at 425 nm for DOX and 521 nm for OXY, with linear calibration graphs in the concentration range of 0.5-35 mg L<sup>-1</sup> (DOX) and 1.0-40 mg L<sup>-1</sup> (OXY) and limits of detection of 0.24 mg L<sup>-1</sup> (DOX) and 0.32 mg L<sup>-1</sup> (OXY). For the μPAD method, color intensity was measured from photographs and a linear increase was observed at concentrations from above approximately 15 mg L<sup>-1</sup> for both compounds and up to 35 mg L<sup>-1</sup> for DOX and 40 mg L<sup>-1</sup> for OXY.

Influence of ZnO morphology on the capability of portable paper-based electrospray ionization mass spectrometry to determine therapeutic drugs in complex matrices.,"Yan Zhang, Yajie Huang, Yun Li, Zhiming Zhang, Qianqian Zuo, Yajun Zheng, Zhiping Zhang","Adsorbents play a significant role in enhancing the analytical sensitivity of target analytes in complex samples by mitigating matrix effects. In our recent report, ZnO stood out among various adsorbents to determine target therapeutic drugs in complex biological matrices when applied for portable paper-based electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PPESI-MS). However, the influence of the morphology of ZnO on the performance of PPESI-MS is elusive. Herein, different morphologies of ZnO particles were prepared via co-precipitation or ultrasonic methods, and their capability to determine different therapeutic drugs in serum were systemically investigated. The results demonstrated that flower-shaped ZnO gave a superior capacity, and its analysis sensitivity was 2.9-12.8-fold higher than those achieved with other ZnO morphologies. Further characterization revealed that the unique performance of flower-shaped ZnO was closely associated with its favorable desorption behavior to drugs, small spray plume, and few spray emitters at the tip of coated paper substrate. To illustrate the potential of flower-shaped ZnO, its coated paper was used as a substrate for the determination of various drugs in complex matrices such as serum, and a limit of detection as low as 2 pg mL<sup>-1</sup> was achieved.

Binder-block copolymer micelle interactions in bactericidal filter paper.,"Nura Mansur-Azzam, Su Gyeong Woo, Adi Eisenberg, Theo G M van de Ven","We previously produced a bactericidal filter paper loaded with PAA47-b-PS214 block copolymer micelles containing the biocide triclosan (TCN), using cationic polyacryamide (cPAM) as a binder. However, we encountered a very slow filtration, resulting in long bacteria deactivation times. Slow drainage occurred only when the filter paper was left to dry. It appears that the filter paper with cPAM and micelles develops hydrophobic properties responsible for this very slow filtration. Three approaches were taken to accelerate the very slow drainage all based on modification of binder-micelle interactions: (i) keeping the micelles wet, (ii) modification of the corona, and (iii) replacing cPAM with smaller and more highly charged cationic poly(isopropanol dimethylammonium) chloride (PIDMAC). In all cases, the drainage time of bactericidal filter paper became close to that of untreated filter paper, without decreasing its efficiency. Moreover, replacing cPAM with PIDMAC led to a much more efficient bactericidal filter paper that reduced bacteria viability by more than 6 orders of magnitude.

Medicine's perception of reality - a split picture: critical reflections on apparent anomalies within the biomedical theory of science.,"Anna Luise Kirkengen, Tor-Johan Ekeland, Linn Getz, Irene Hetlevik, Edvin Schei, Elling Ulvestad, Arne Johan Vetlesen","Escalating costs, increasing multi-morbidity, medically unexplained health problems, complex risk, poly-pharmacy and antibiotic resistance can be regarded as artefacts of the traditional knowledge production in Western medicine, arising from its particular worldview. Our paper presents a historically grounded critical analysis of this view. The materialistic shift of Enlightenment philosophy, separating subjectivity from bodily matter, became normative for modern medicine and yielded astonishing results. The traditional dichotomies of mind/body and subjective/objective are, however, incompatible with modern biological theory. Medical knowledge ignores central tenets of human existence, notably the physiological impact of subjective experience, relationships, history and sociocultural contexts.

Planning and tracking chemotherapy production for cancer treatment: a performing and integrated solution.,"Y Kergosien, J-F Tournamille, B Laurence, J-C Billaut","Chemotherapy drugs are intended for the treatment of cancer. The production of such drugs and their administration to the patient is a delicate and expensive operation. The study deals with the acquisition and processing of data regarding the production of intravenous chemotherapy, from the production request (the medical prescription), the production itself (pharmaceutical process), to the delivery in the health care unit, for the administration of the chemotherapy.

"New psychoactive substances (NPS) prevalence over LSD in blotter seized in State of Santa Catarina, Brazil: A six-year retrospective study.","Bruna de Souza Boff, Jair Silveira Filho, Karina Nonemacher, Samilla Driessen Schroeder, Marcelo Dutra Arbo, Kéttulin Zomer Rezin","Designer drugs or new psychoactive substances (NPS) are a heterogeneous group of substances obtained through the modification of chemical structure of some natural products or drugs. NPS illegally commercialized in blotter papers mimicking the most common form of LSD consumption, with a great variability of colours and symbols, have largely increased worldwide, including in Brazil, becoming an important emerging public health issue. In this study, we have evaluated the presence and profile of NPS in blotters seized in the State of Santa Catarina, Brazil, over the period of 2011 to 2017. The state government criminal forensics staff has performed gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) analyses in order to determine the chemical composition of the blotters. During the evaluated period, there was a considerable increase in the seizing of blotters events, from 87 in 2011, to 301 in 2016 and reaching 277 in 2017. There was also an increase in the number of blotters seized per event. Interestingly, while in 2011, 100% of blotters contained LSD, this number decreased to 0,1% in 2014, and achieved 17,6% in 2017, when up to 25 different substances were detected in blotters seized. Drugs such as DOx, NBOMe, fentanyl, mescaline derivatives, triptamines, cathinones, and synthetic cannabinoids were detected and became the major substances found in blotters. In some cases, more than one substance was found in the same blotter, characterizing a new mixture scenario. The presence of several new psychoactive substances in blotters is a reality in forensic toxicology. In Brazil, it might be related to the fact that most of these substances were not considered illegal by Brazilian legislation by the time they emerged.",2019,Forensic science international,"Chemical profile, LSD, New psychoactive substances (NPS), Paper blotters","Brazil, Designer Drugs, Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry, Humans, Illicit Drugs, Lysergic Acid Diethylamide, Paper, Psychotropic Drugs, Retrospective Studies, Substance-Related Disorders",10.1016/j.forsciint.2019.110002,"Instituto Geral de Perícias (IGP-SC), Rua Pastor Willian Richard Schisler Filho, 590 - Itacorubi - Florianópolis, Santa Catarina, Brazil.

Exploring the chemical profile of designer drugs by ESI(+) and PSI(+) mass spectrometry-An approach on the fragmentation mechanisms and chemometric analysis.,"Nayara A Dos Santos, Clebson J Macrino, João Francisco Allochio Filho, Fernanda F Gonçalves, Camila M Almeida, Fabiana Agostini, Tainara Guizolfi, Sidnei Moura, Valdemar Lacerda, Paulo R Filgueiras, Rafael S Ortiz, Wanderson Romão","The consumption of design drugs, frequently known as new psychoactive substances (NPS), has increased considerably worldwide, becoming a severe issue for the responsible governmental agencies. These illicit substances can be defined as synthetic compounds produced in clandestine laboratories in order to act as analogs of schedule drugs mimetizing its chemical structure and improving its pharmacological effects while hampering the control and making regulation more complicated. In this way, the development of new methodologies for chemical analysis of NPS drugs is indispensable to determine a novel class of drugs arising from the underground market. Therefore, this work shows the use of high-resolution mass spectrometry Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) applying different ionization sources such as paper spray ionization (PSI) and electrospray ionization (ESI) in the evaluation of miscellaneous of seized drugs samples as blotter paper (n = 79) and tablet (n = 100). Also, an elucidative analysis was performed by ESI(+)MS/MS experiments, and fragmentation mechanisms were proposed to confirm the chemical structure of compounds identified. Besides, the results of ESI(+) and PSI(+)-FT-ICR MS were compared with those of GC-MS, revealing that ESI(+)MS showed greater detection efficiency among the methodologies employed in this study. Moreover, this study stands out as a guide for the chemical analysis of NPS drugs, highlighting the differences between the techniques of ESI(+)-FT-ICR MS, PSI(+)-FT-ICR MS, and GC-MS.",No date available,Journal of mass spectrometry : JMS,"ESI, GC-MS, PSI, designer drugs, new psychoactive substances (NPS)","Designer Drugs, Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry, Illicit Drugs, Paper, Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization, Tandem Mass Spectrometry",10.1002/jms.4596,"Laboratório de Petroleômica e Forense, Universidade Federal do Espírito Santo (UFES), Avenida Fernando Ferrari, 514, Goiabeiras, Vitória, ES, CEP: 29075-910, Brazil., Laboratório de Petroleômica e Forense, Universidade Federal do Espírito Santo (UFES), Avenida Fernando Ferrari, 514, Goiabeiras, Vitória, ES, CEP: 29075-910, Brazil., Laboratório de Petroleômica e Forense, Universidade Federal do Espírito Santo (UFES), Avenida Fernando Ferrari, 514, Goiabeiras, Vitória, ES, CEP: 29075-910, Brazil., Laboratório de Petroleômica e Forense, Universidade Federal do Espírito Santo (UFES), Avenida Fernando Ferrari, 514, Goiabeiras, Vitória, ES, CEP: 29075-910, Brazil., Laboratório de Petroleômica e Forense, Universidade Federal do Espírito Santo (UFES), Avenida Fernando Ferrari, 514, Goiabeiras, Vitória, ES, CEP: 29075-910, Brazil., Instituto Nacional de Ciência e Tecnologia Forense (INCT Forense), Vitoria, Brazil., Instituto Nacional de Ciência e Tecnologia Forense (INCT Forense), Vitoria, Brazil., Instituto Nacional de Ciência e Tecnologia Forense (INCT Forense), Vitoria, Brazil., Laboratório de Petroleômica e Forense, Universidade Federal do Espírito Santo (UFES), Avenida Fernando Ferrari, 514, Goiabeiras, Vitória, ES, CEP: 29075-910, Brazil., Laboratório de Petroleômica e Forense, Universidade Federal do Espírito Santo (UFES), Avenida Fernando Ferrari, 514, Goiabeiras, Vitória, ES, CEP: 29075-910, Brazil., Instituto Nacional de Ciência e Tecnologia Forense (INCT Forense), Vitoria, Brazil., Laboratório de Petroleômica e Forense, Universidade Federal do Espírito Santo (UFES), Avenida Fernando Ferrari, 514, Goiabeiras, Vitória, ES, CEP: 29075-910, Brazil."
Reference drug programs: effectiveness and policy implications.,Sebastian Schneeweiss,"In the current economic environment, health care systems are constantly struggling to contain rapidly rising costs. Drug costs are targeted by a wide variety of measures. Many jurisdictions have implemented reference drug programs (RDPs) or similar therapeutic substitution programs. This paper summarizes the mechanism and rationale of RDPs and presents evidence of their economic effectiveness and clinical safety. RDPs for pharmaceutical reimbursement are based on the assumption that drugs within specified medication groups are therapeutically equivalent and clinically interchangeable and that a common reimbursement level can thus be established. If the evidence documents that a higher price for a given drug does not buy greater effectiveness or reduced toxicity, then under RDP such extra costs are not covered. RDPs or therapeutic substitutions based on therapeutic equivalence are seen as logical extensions of generic substitution that is based on bioequivalence of drugs. If the goal is to achieve full drug coverage for as many patients as possible in the most efficient manner, then RDPs in combination with prior authorization programs are safer and more effective than simplistic fiscal drug policies, including fixed co-payments, co-insurances, or deductibles. RDPs will reduce spending in the less innovative but largest market, while fully covering all patients. Prior authorization will ensure that patients with a specified indication will benefit from the most innovative therapies with full coverage. In practice, however, not all patients and drugs will fit exactly into one of the two categories. Therefore, a process of medically indicated exemptions that will consider full coverage should accompany an RDP. In the current economic environment, health care systems are constantly struggling to contain rapidly rising costs. Drug costs are targeted by a wide variety of measures. Many jurisdictions have implemented reference drug programs, and others are considering them.

Sub-ppt Mass Spectrometric Detection of Therapeutic Drugs in Complex Biological Matrixes Using Polystyrene-Microsphere-Coated Paper Spray.,"Teng Wang, Yajun Zheng, Xiaoting Wang, Daniel E Austin, Zhiping Zhang","Polystyrene (PS) is a class of polymer materials that offers great potential for various applications. However, the applications of PS microspheres in paper spray mass spectrometry are largely underexplored. Herein we prepared a series of PS microspheres via a simple dispersion polymerization and then used them as coating materials for paper spray mass spectrometry (MS) in high-sensitivity analysis of various therapeutic drugs in complex biological matrixes. In the preparation of PS-coated papers, the coating method was found playing a key role in determining the performance of the resulting paper substrate in addition to other parameters (e.g., starch type and amount, PS coating amount, and spray solvent). We also found that as a solvent was applied on PS-coated paper for paper spray, the analytes of interest would be first extracted out and then moved to the tip of paper triangle for spray along with the applied solvent. In the process, the surface energy of PS particles had a strong impact on the desorption performance of analytes from PS-coated paper substrate, and the PS with a high surface energy favored the elution of analytes to allow a high MS sensitivity. When the prepared PS coated paper was used as a substrate for paper spray, it gave high sensitivity in analysis of therapeutic drugs in various biological matrixes such as whole blood, serum, and urine with excellent repeatability and reproducibility. In contrast to uncoated filter paper, an improvement of 10-546-fold in sensitivity was achieved using PS-coated paper for paper spray, and an estimated lower limit of quantitation (LLOQs) in the range of 0.004-0.084 ng mL<sup>-1</sup> was obtained. The present study is significant in exploring the potential of PS for high-sensitivity MS analysis, and it provides a promising platform in the translation of the MS technique to clinical applications.",2017,Analytical chemistry,No keywords,"Amisulpride, Humans, Limit of Detection, Mass Spectrometry, Microspheres, Paper, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Polystyrenes, Reproducibility of Results, Solvents",10.1021/acs.analchem.7b01296,"School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xi'an Shiyou University , Xi'an 710065, China., School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xi'an Shiyou University , Xi'an 710065, China., School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xi'an Shiyou University , Xi'an 710065, China., Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Brigham Young University , Provo, Utah 84602, United States., School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xi'an Shiyou University , Xi'an 710065, China."

Impact of separating drug prescribing and dispensing on provider behaviour: Taiwan's experience.,"Y J Chou, Winnie C Yip, Cheng-Hua Lee, Nicole Huang, Ying-Pei Sun, Hong-Jen Chang","In many Asian countries, physicians both prescribe and dispense drugs. This practice is hypothesized to have caused high drug expenditure and widespread prescription of antibiotics in Asia. Recently, Taiwan implemented the separation policy on an experimental basis. This paper's objective is to empirically evaluate the impact of Taiwan's reform to separate drug prescribing and dispensing on drug expenditure and total health expenditure. The research design consists of a pre/post comparison of the experimental with the control sites (difference-in-difference). Separation policy was implemented in Kaohsung and Taipei in March 1997, and expanded to Chia-yi and Taichung in March 1998. Changes in drug prescription behaviour before and after implementation in these two pairs of experimental cities were compared to Hsin-chu and Tainan (control), where separation policy was not implemented during the study period. To reduce resistance, providers in experimental sites were allowed to hire on-site pharmacists and dispense drugs through them if they chose to do so. Our study sample consists of all outpatient visits to clinics in the study sites between December 1996 and June 1998, with a total of 55.23 million claim records. The drug prescription rate, drug expenditure and total health expenditure per visit were the main outcome measures. We found that the probability of prescription and drug expenditure per visit were, respectively, 17-34% and 12-36% less among visits to clinics without on-site pharmacists, compared with the control sites. However, no difference in total health expenditure was found between these two types of visits. Hence, the separation policy could be effective in reducing drug expenditure and affecting prescription behaviour, but is less certain as a policy for reducing total health expenditure. We also found that the policy has practically no effect on clinics that have on-site pharmacists.",No date available,Health policy and planning,No keywords,"Drug Costs, Drug Prescriptions, Drug Utilization, Health Expenditures, Health Services Research, Humans, Insurance, Pharmaceutical Services, Motivation, National Health Programs, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Physician's Role, Policy Making, Taiwan",No DOI available,"National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan."
Combining the geometry of folded paper with liquid-infused polymer surfaces to concentrate and localize bacterial solutions.,"Daniel P Regan, Chloe Lilly, Abigail Weigang, Liza R White, Emily J LeClair, Alexander Collins, Caitlin Howell","Point-of-care (POC) detection and diagnostic platforms provide critical information about health and safety conditions in austere and resource-limited settings in which medical, military, and disaster relief operations are conducted. In this work, low-cost paper materials commonly used in POC devices are coated with liquid-infused polymer surfaces and folded to produce geometries that precisely localize complex liquid samples undergoing concentration by evaporation. Liquid-infused polymer surfaces were fabricated by infusing silicone-coated paper with a chemically compatible polydimethylsiloxane oil to create a liquid overlayer. Tests on these surfaces showed no remaining bacterial cells after exposure to a sliding droplet containing a concentrated solution of Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus, while samples without a liquid layer showed adhesion of both microdroplets and individual bacterial cells. Folding of the paper substrates with liquid-infused polymer surfaces into several functional 3D geometries enabled a clean separation and simultaneous concentration of a liquid containing rhodamine dye into discrete, predefined locations. When used with bacteria, which are known for their ability to adhere to nearly any surface type, functional geometries with liquid-infused polymer surfaces concentrated the cells at levels significantly higher than geometries with dry control surfaces. These results show the potential of synergistically combining paper-based materials with liquid-infused polymer surfaces for the manipulation and handling of complex samples, which may help the future engineering of POC devices.",2019,Biointerphases,No keywords,"Bacterial Adhesion, Bacteriological Techniques, Escherichia coli, Paper, Polymers, Staphylococcus aureus, Surface Properties, Suspensions",10.1116/1.5114804,"Department of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering, University of Maine, 5737 Jenness Hall, Orono, Maine 04469., Department of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering, University of Maine, 5737 Jenness Hall, Orono, Maine 04469., Department of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering, University of Maine, 5737 Jenness Hall, Orono, Maine 04469., Department of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering, University of Maine, 5737 Jenness Hall, Orono, Maine 04469., Department of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering, University of Maine, 5737 Jenness Hall, Orono, Maine 04469., Department of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering, University of Maine, 5737 Jenness Hall, Orono, Maine 04469., Department of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering, University of Maine, 5737 Jenness Hall, Orono, Maine 04469."
Silica coated paper substrate for paper-spray analysis of therapeutic drugs in dried blood spots.,"Zhiping Zhang, Wei Xu, Nicholas E Manicke, R Graham Cooks, Zheng Ouyang","Paper spray is a newly developed ambient ionization method that has been applied for direct qualitative and quantitative analysis of biological samples. The properties of the paper substrate and spray solution have a significant impact on the release of chemical compounds from complex sample matrices, the diffusion of the analytes through the substrate, and the formation of ions for mass spectrometry analysis. In this study, a commercially available silica-coated paper was explored in an attempt to improve the analysis of therapeutic drugs in dried blood spots (DBS). The dichloromethane/isopropanol solvent has been identified as an optimal spray solvent for the analysis. The comparison was made with paper spray using chromatography paper as substrate with methanol/water as solvent for the analysis of verapamil, citalopram, amitriptyline, lidocaine, and sunitinib in dried blood spots. It has been demonstrated that the efficiency of recovery of the analytes was notably improved with the silica coated paper and the limit of quantitation (LOQ) for the drug analysis was 0.1 ng mL(-1) using a commercial triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. The use of silica paper substrate also resulted in a sensitivity improvement of 5-50-fold in comparison with chromatography papers, including the Whatman ET31 paper used for blood cards.

Substituted naphthoquinones as novel amino acid sensitive reagents for the detection of latent fingermarks on paper surfaces.,"R Jelly, S W Lewis, C Lennard, K F Lim, J Almog","In this paper, we present our preliminary studies into naphthoquinones as novel reagents for the detection of latent fingermarks on paper. Latent fingermarks deposited on paper substrates were treated with solutions of selected naphthoquinones in ethyl acetate/HFE-7100, with subsequent heating. The selected compounds were 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid, 1,2-naphthoquinone-4-sulfonate, 2-methoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone and 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone. All of the tested compounds yielded purple-brown visible fingermarks, which also exhibited photoluminescence when illuminated with a high intensity filtered light source at 555 nm and viewed through red goggles. Indirect heat using an oven at 150°C for 1h was found to be superior to direct heat with an iron, which while providing faster development lead to increased levels of background colouration. Luminescence spectrophotometry revealed differences in photoluminescence characteristics for fingermarks developed with the different naphthoquinones, with excitation over the range 530-590 nm.

Impedimetric quantification of cells encapsulated in hydrogel cultured in a paper-based microchamber.,"Kin Fong Lei, Chia-Hao Huang, Ngan-Ming Tsang","Recently, 3D cell culture technique was proposed to provide a more physiologically-meaningful environment for cell-based assays. With the development of microfluidics technology, cellular response can be quantified by impedance measurement technique in a real-time and non-invasive manner. However, handling of these microfluidic systems requires a trained engineering personnel and the operation is not compatible to traditional biological research laboratories. In this work, we incorporated the impedance measurement technique to paper-based 3D cell culture model and demonstrated non-invasive quantification of cells encapsulated in hydrogel during the culture course. A cellulose filter paper was patterned with an array of circular microchambers. Cells were encapsulated in hydrogel and loaded to the microchambers for culturing cells in 3D environment. At the preset schedule during the culture course, the paper was placed on a glass substrate with measurement electrodes for the impedance measurement. Cells in each microchamber was represented by impedance magnitude and cell proliferation could be studied over time. Also, conventional bio-assay was performed to further confirm the feasibility of the impedimetric quantification of cells encapsulated in hydrogel cultured in the paper-based microchamber.

Evaluation of DFO/PVP and its application to latent fingermarks development on thermal paper.,"Ya-Ping Luo, Ya-Bin Zhao, Sai Liu","A new method for improved development of latent fingermarks on thermal paper by 1,8-diazafluoren-9-one (DFO) treatment is described. Compared with conventional DFO solution, the mixed solution of DFO/PVP (polyvinylpyrrolidone) described here reduces black background staining without removing the thermosensitive layer and develops fingermarks by the reaction of DFO with amino acid deposited on the thermal paper's surface. An advantage of this approach is that the developed fluorescent fingermarks have high contrast and can be observed and photographed when excited in the 515 nm region and observed through an orange-red barrier long-pass filter with no background coloration. In addition, the method reported here does not involve any pre- or post treatment of the substrate and exhibits high sensitivity with good stability. Experimental results showed that the method was able to develop very old fingermarks, up to 154 days old, demonstrating the feasibility of using the method to develop identifiable latent fingermarks operationally. Furthermore, we extended our experiments to various types of thermal papers.

'Every bone of my body:' domestic violence and the diagnostic body.,Paige L Sweet,"Diagnostic categories for domestic violence have shifted over time, transforming from a disorder of psychological passivity and acute injury into a chronic and somatically invasive condition. This paper links these changing diagnoses to constructions of the abused body and to victim-blaming narratives. Based on an analysis of medical journal articles, this research identifies two logics that undergird domestic violence diagnoses, the body, and victim-blaming: 1) the logic of injury (1970s-1980s); and 2) the logic of health (late 1980s-present). The logic of injury is associated with overt victim-blaming, a temporally bounded and injured body, and psychological passivity. Once the feminist anti-violence movement gained mainstream credibility, however, the logic of injury fell out of favor as an explanation for domestic violence. What surfaced next was the logic of health, which is associated with chronic diagnoses and what the author calls a temporally extended body. The temporally extended body is flexible and layered, linking up past, present, and future states of disordered embodiment. The author suggests that, rather than ushering in hope and possibility via the logic of health's somatic flexibility, this abused body creates spaces into which new forms of blame and self-responsibility can take shape.",2014,Social science & medicine (1982),"Biomedicalization, Body, Chronic, Diagnosis, Domestic violence, Temporality","Acute Disease, Battered Women, Chronic Disease, Crime Victims, Female, Health Status, Humans, Medicalization, Mental Disorders, Spouse Abuse, Stress, Psychological, Wounds and Injuries",10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.10.014,"Sociology, University of Illinois at Chicago, 1007 West Harrison Street (MC 312), Chicago, IL 60607-7140, United States.

Identification of dyes on ancient Chinese paper samples using the subtracted shifted Raman spectroscopy method.,"S E Bell, E S Bourguignon, A C Dennis, J A Fields, J J McGarvey, K R Seddon","The Stein Collection in the British Library contains the Diamond Sutra, the world's oldest, dated, printed document. The paper of the Diamond Sutra and other documents from the Stein collection is believed to be dyed yellow by a natural extract, called huangbo, from the bark of Phellodendron amurense, which contains three major yellow chromophores: berberine, palmatine, and jatrorrhizine. Conservation of these documents requires definite information on the chemical composition of the dyes but no suitable, completely noninvasive analytical method is known. Here we report resonance Raman studies of a series of pure dyes, of plant materials and extracts, and of dyed ancient and modern paper samples. Resonance Raman spectroscopy is used to enhance the spectra of the dyes over the signals from the paper matrixes in which they are held. The samples all give resonance Raman spectra which are dominated by intense fluorescence, but by using SSRS (subtracted shifted Raman spectroscopy) we have obtained reliable spectra of the pure dyes, native bark from the Phellodendron amurense, modern paper dyed with huangbo extracted from this bark, and ancient paper samples. For both ancient paper samples whose pigment bands were detected, the relative intensities of the bands due to berberine and palmatine suggest that the ancient paper is richer in berberine than its modern counterpart. This is the first nondestructive in situ method for detection of these pigments in manuscripts, and as such has considerable potential benefit for the treatment of irreplaceable documents that are believed to be dyed with huangbo but documents on which conservation work cannot proceed without definite identification of the chemical compounds that they contain.",No date available,Analytical chemistry,No keywords,"Luminescent Measurements, Paper, Pigments, Biological, Plant Extracts, Spectrum Analysis, Raman, Trees",No DOI available,"School of Chemistry, Queen's University of Belfast, Northern Ireland.

Political economy of hope as a cultural facet of biomedicalization: A qualitative examination of constraints to hospice utilization among U.S. end-stage cancer patients.,"Emily Hammad Mrig, Karen Lutfey Spencer","A growing body of social science literature is devoted to describing processes of biomedicalization. The issue of biomedicalization is especially relevant for individuals suffering from end-stage cancer and hoping that aggressive end-of-life interventions, which are riddled with uncertainty around quantity or quality of life, will produce a 'cure'. To examine hospice underutilization among end-stage cancer patients, we apply the anthropological concept 'political economy of hope,' which describes how personal and collective 'hope' is associated with the political and economic structures that produce biomedicalization processes. Previous studies have examined hospice underutilization among end-stage cancer patients and have identified barriers stemming from patient and physician characteristics or health insurance reimbursement policies. Yet, these studies do not provide an organized synthesis of how barriers articulate, how they are part of the longitudinal decision-making process, or describe the sociocultural context surrounding hospice care enrollment decisions. This paper focuses on US-specific mechanisms and is based on qualitative, in-depth, interviews with physicians at an academic hospital (N = 24). We find that hospice underutilization results from a web of interconnected constraints surrounding end-stage cancer patients. Our research reveals how hospice care contradicts the political and economic structures associated with end-stage cancer care and illustrates how end-stage cancer patients are transformed into a form of biovalue, a fundamental commodity sustaining the political economy of hope.",2018,Social science & medicine (1982),"Biomedicalization, Cancer, Hope, Hospice care, Political economy, Qualitative methods, United States","Cultural Characteristics, Female, Hope, Hospice Care, Humans, Male, Medicalization, Neoplasm Staging, Neoplasms, Qualitative Research, United States",10.1016/j.socscimed.2018.01.033,"University of Colorado, Denver, United States.

The non-positive antiretroviral gay body: the biomedicalisation of gay sex in England.,Alvaro Martinez-Lacabe,"Drawing on testimonies from oral history interviews, this paper analyses the implications of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) practices for gay men in England. Through perspectives on biomedicalisation, the paper focuses on three aspects relevant to the construction of technoscientific identities in the realm of HIV prevention: (i) the question of agency of PrEP users in the context of what has been defined as a biomedical intervention, (ii) practices of freedom framed within neoliberal narratives of personal responsibility versus responsibilisation and (iii) the governance of risk in the era of biomedicalisation. The paper concludes that biomedical governmentalities, even those shaped by the rhetoric of personal responsibility, can be understood as rationalities linked more to solidarity and <i>care of the other</i>. Despite this, the use of PrEP in England is also giving way to the configuration of new sexual scenarios shaped by zero-risk mentalities. It will be important to remain alert to the implications of zero-risk scenarios for HIV-related stigma.RésuméEn s'appuyant sur des témoignages provenant d'entretiens centrés sur des histoires orales, cet article analyse les implications des pratiques de la PrEP chez les hommes gays en Angleterre. À travers les points de vue sur la bio-médicalisation, il se concentre sur trois aspects de la construction des identités technoscientifiques dans le royaume de la prévention du VIH : i) la question de la capacité à agir des utilisateurs de la PrEP dans le contexte de ce qui a été défini comme une intervention biomédicale, ii) les pratiques de la liberté, encadrées par les récits néolibéraux sur la responsabilité personnelle, versus la responsabilisation, et iii) la gouvernance du risque à l'ère de la bio-médicalisation. En conclusion de leur article, les auteurs soutiennent que les << gouvernementalités >> biomédicales, y compris celles qui sont déterminées par la rhétorique de la responsabilité personnelle, peuvent être comprises comme des rationalités plus en rapport avec la solidarité et le souci des autres. Malgré cela, l'usage de la PrEP en Angleterre laisse la place à la configuration de nouveaux scénarios sexuels déterminés par les mentalités du risque zéro. Il est important de rester attentif aux implications des scénarios du risque zéro au regard du stigma lié au VIH.ResumenA partir de testimonios obtenidos a través de entrevistas de historia oral, el presente artículo analiza las repercusiones de la PrEP (profilaxis preexposición para el vih, por sus iniciales en inglés) en las prácticas de hombres gais en Inglaterra. Partiendo de perspectivas sobre la biomedicalización, el artículo se centra en tres aspectos pertinentes a la construcción de identidades tecnocientíficas en el ámbito de la prevención del vih: i) la cuestión de la gestión (agency) de los usuarios de la PrEP en un contexto identificado como de intervención biomédica; ii) las prácticas de libertad enmarcadas en narrativas neoliberales de responsabilidad personal versus responsabilización; iii) el manejo del riesgo en la era de la biomedicalización. El artículo concluye que los manejos biomédicos, incluso aquellos moldeados por la retórica de responsabilidad personal, pueden entenderse como racionalidades vinculadas más con la solidaridad y el cuidado de los demás. A pesar de esto, el uso de la PrEP en Inglaterra está cediendo espacio a la configuración de nuevos escenarios sexuales determinados por esquemas mentales de riesgo cero.

Beyond the medicine cabinet: an analysis of where and why medications accumulate.,"Ilene Sue Ruhoy, Christian G Daughton","Active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) from medications can enter the environment as trace contaminants, at individual concentrations generally below a part per billion (microg/L). APIs enter the environment primarily via the discharge of raw and treated sewage. Residues of unmetabolized APIs from parenteral and enteral drugs are excreted in feces and urine, and topically applied medications are washed from skin during bathing. These trace residues may pose risks for aquatic life and cause concern with regard to subsequent human exposure. APIs also enter the environment from the disposal of unwanted medications directly to sewers and trash. The relative significance of this route compared with excretion and bathing is poorly understood and has been subject to much speculation. Two major aspects of uncertainty exist: the percentage of any particular API in the environment originating from disposal is unknown, and disposal undoubtedly occurs from a variety of dispersed sources. Sources of disposal, along with the types and quantities of APIs resulting from each source, are important to understand so that effective pollution prevention approaches can be designed and implemented. Accumulation of leftover, unwanted drugs poses three major concerns: (i) APIs disposed to sewage or trash compose a diverse source of potential chemical stressors in the environment. (ii) Accumulated drugs represent increased potential for drug diversion, with its attendant risks of unintentional poisonings and abuse. (iii) Leftover drugs represent wasted healthcare resources and lost opportunities for medical treatment. This paper has four major purposes: (1) Define the processes, actions, and behaviors that control and drive the consumption, accumulation, and need for disposal of pharmaceuticals. (2) Provide an overview of the diverse locations where drugs are used and accumulate. (3) Present a summary of the first cataloging of APIs disposed by a defined subpopulation.

"Investigating sources of pharmaceutical pollution: Survey of over-the-counter and prescription medication purchasing, use, and disposal practices among university students.","Christine Vatovec, Emily Van Wagoner, Corey Evans","Pharmaceutical pollution in surface waters poses a range of risks to public health and aquatic ecosystems. Consumers contribute to pharmaceutical pollution via use and disposal of medications, though data on such behaviors is limited. This paper investigates the purchasing, use, and disposal practices among a population that has been researched only minimally to date, yet will determine pharmaceutical pollution for decades to come: young adults represented by a university student population. We employed an online, 21-question survey to examine behaviors related to pharmaceuticals among students at the University of Vermont (n = 358). Results indicate that the majority of respondents had purchased medications in the previous 12 months (94%), and had leftover drugs (61%). Contrary to previous studies of older populations, only a small proportion of students had disposed of drugs (18%); municipal trash was the primary route of drug disposal (25%), and very few students disposed drugs via flushing (1%). Less than a quarter of students were aware of drug take-back programs (24%), and only 4% had ever used take-back services. These findings indicate that the university student population may be storing a large volume of unused drugs that will require future disposal. Increasing awareness of, access to, and participation in pro-environment pharmaceutical behaviors, such as purchasing over-the-counter medication in smaller quantities and utilizing drug take-back programs, could minimize future pharmaceutical pollution from this population.",2017,Journal of environmental management,"Pharmaceutical pollution, Pharmaceutical waste disposal, Social science survey, Sources of pharmaceuticals in wastewater, University demographic","Environmental Pollution, Humans, Medical Waste Disposal, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Students, Surveys and Questionnaires, Universities",10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.04.101,"Rubenstein School of Environment and Natural Resources and College of Medicine, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT, USA.

"Old age and vulnerability between first, second and third person perspectives. Ethnographic explorations of aging in contemporary Denmark.",Lone Grøn,"This paper is based on an ethnographic fieldwork aimed at exploring ethnographically how vulnerability in old age is perceived and experienced in contemporary Denmark. The fieldwork showed remarkable differences between two phases of the fieldwork: the first addressing vulnerability from the ""outside"" through group interviews with professionals, leaders and older people who were not (yet) vulnerable; and the second from the ""inside"" through more in depth fieldwork with older people who in diverse ways could be seen as vulnerable. After a short introduction to anthropological and social gerontological literature on characteristics of ""Western"" aging: medicalization, successful, healthy and active aging, I present findings from both phases of this ethnographic fieldwork arguing that the ethnographic approach reveals the composite and complex nature of vulnerability in old age and the constant interactions between first, second and third person perspectives. Through these methodological and analytical moves a complex and empirically tenable understanding of vulnerability in old age has emerged which 1. moves beyond rigid dichotomies that have characterized the study of old age, 2. integrates individual experience, social interaction and the structural and discursive context into the analysis, and 3. reveals the complex interplay between vulnerability and agency in diverse situations and settings of old age.",2016,Journal of aging studies,"Active aging, Denmark, Ethnography, Old age, Vulnerability","Adult Day Care Centers, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Aging, Anthropology, Cultural, Attitude to Health, Denmark, Home Care Services, Homes for the Aged, Humans, Income, Interpersonal Relations, Medicalization, Perception, Social Marginalization, Social Support, Vulnerable Populations",10.1016/j.jaging.2016.09.002,"KORA, Danish Institute for Local and Regional Government Research, Copenhagen, Denmark.

Electrophoretic removal, from porous material, of undesired stains due to charged species is theoretically an interesting alternative to chemical cleaning methods, but the lack of specific and comprehensive research work leads to controversial opinions about the efficiency and the needed harmfulness for the treated objects. In this work paper, samples with artificial rust stains were subjected to electrophoretic cleaning treatments in mineral water as electrolyte. Treatments were carried out either in a bath by complete sample immersion between the distanced electrodes or by sample wetting and sandwiching between the electrodes.

Two-dimensional paper networks: programmable fluidic disconnects for multi-step processes in shaped paper.,"Barry R Lutz, Philip Trinh, Cameron Ball, Elain Fu, Paul Yager","Most laboratory assays take advantage of multi-step protocols to achieve high performance, but conventional paper-based tests (e.g., lateral flow tests) are generally limited to assays that can be carried out in a single fluidic step. We have developed two-dimensional paper networks (2DPNs) that use materials from lateral flow tests but reconfigure them to enable programming of multi-step reagent delivery sequences. The 2DPN uses multiple converging fluid inlets to control the arrival time of each fluid to a detection zone or reaction zone, and it requires a method to disconnect each fluid source in a corresponding timed sequence. Here, we present a method that allows programmed disconnection of fluid sources required for multi-step delivery. A 2DPN with legs of different lengths is inserted into a shared buffer well, and the dropping fluid surface disconnects each leg at in a programmable sequence.

Cross-terminology mapping challenges: a demonstration using medication terminological systems.,"Himali Saitwal, David Qing, Stephen Jones, Elmer V Bernstam, Christopher G Chute, Todd R Johnson","Standardized terminological systems for biomedical information have provided considerable benefits to biomedical applications and research. However, practical use of this information often requires mapping across terminological systems-a complex and time-consuming process. This paper demonstrates the complexity and challenges of mapping across terminological systems in the context of medication information. It provides a review of medication terminological systems and their linkages, then describes a case study in which we mapped proprietary medication codes from an electronic health record to SNOMED CT and the UMLS Metathesaurus. The goal was to create a polyhierarchical classification system for querying an i2b2 clinical data warehouse. We found that three methods were required to accurately map the majority of actively prescribed medications. Only 62.5% of source medication codes could be mapped automatically. The remaining codes were mapped using a combination of semi-automated string comparison with expert selection, and a completely manual approach. Compound drugs were especially difficult to map: only 7.5% could be mapped using the automatic method. General challenges to mapping across terminological systems include (1) the availability of up-to-date information to assess the suitability of a given terminological system for a particular use case, and to assess the quality and completeness of cross-terminology links; (2) the difficulty of correctly using complex, rapidly evolving, modern terminologies; (3) the time and effort required to complete and evaluate the mapping; (4) the need to address differences in granularity between the source and target terminologies; and (5) the need to continuously update the mapping as terminological systems evolve.",2012,Journal of biomedical informatics,No keywords,"Clinical Coding, Electronic Health Records, Humans, Medical Informatics, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Reproducibility of Results, Vocabulary, Controlled",10.1016/j.jbi.2012.06.005,"The University of Texas School of Biomedical Informatics at Houston, 7000 Fannin Suite 600, Houston, TX 77030, USA. hsaitwal@Apelon.com"

Sadness or depression: Making sense of low mood and the medicalization of everyday life.,"Christian Bröer, Broos Besseling","This research focusses on low mood as a generic category in everyday social interactions, outside the clinical realm and among non-patients. We examine if and how a clinical depression label and treatment are employed when low mood occurs in everyday life, which enables us to analyze the extent and content of medicalization and brings to the fore the interactional mechanisms and cultural concerns that potentially drive medicalization. The analysis is based on 316 observations of everyday life in the Netherlands. We observed and recorded interactions in which low mood was spontaneously expressed. Our paper shows that the clinical depression label resonates widely even if low mood is not fully medicalized. People de-medicalize low mood, and low mood can be un-medicalized. Our analysis thus suggests that dominance is not achieved, which nuances Horwitz and Wakefield's claim that the clinical category of depression has come to encompass all forms of low mood. Moreover, uncertainties about the meaning of low mood and about the depression label remain pragmatic concerns of everyday life. The cultural norm of happiness and active citizenship are very prominent in everyday life across medicalized and un-medicalized interactions. These norms thus seem to be a necessary but insufficient condition for medicalization. While pragmatic concerns do not seem to trigger medicalization either, one specific type of concern is consistently related to medicalization: relational conflicts. In sum, the cultural construction of low mood is not dominated by a single medical approach; however, it mirrors the diversity and uncertainties within and around the medical field.",2017,Social science & medicine (1982),"Depression, Everyday life, Medicalization, Observational methods, The Netherlands","Adult, Attitude to Health, Depression, Female, Humans, Male, Medicalization, Netherlands, Philosophy, Medical",10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.04.025,"University of Amsterdam, Department of Sociology, The Netherlands.

[[History of Community Health in Africa. The Swiss Medical Missionaries' Endeavour in South Africa].,Hines Mabika,"It was not Dutch settlers nor British colonizers who introduced public and community health practice in north-eastern South Africa but medical doctors of the Swiss mission in southern Africa. While the history of medical knowledge transfer into 19th-20th century Africa emphasises colonial powers, this paper shows how countries without colonies contributed to expand western medical cultures, including public health. The Swiss took advantage of the local authorities' negligence, and implemented their own model of medicalization of African societies, understood as the way of improving health standards.

Fluorescent and visual detection of norfloxacin in aqueous solutions with a molecularly imprinted polymer coated paper sensor.,"Wenjun Wang, Zhengjun Gong, Shiwei Yang, Tingting Xiong, Dongmei Wang, Meikun Fan","A dual functional molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) coated paper (MIP-CP) sensor was firstly proposed for rapid fluorescent (FL) and visual analysis of norfloxacin (NOR) in aqueous solutions. The sensor was fabricated via a sol-gel technique, and characterized by FTIR and SEM. The extraction capacity, selectivity, detection limit, and linear range of the MIP-CP sensor were studied by an FL spectrophotometer. The modified paper sensor showed good selectivity and high extraction capacity for NOR and its structural analogues. For FL analysis of NOR, the linear range and detection limit were found to be 10-100 ng/ml and 2.59 ng/ml, respectively. The visual determination of NOR (under UV light) based on the MIP-CP sensor was also explored, and the determination limit was found to be 0.1 μg/ml. Finally, the proposed methods were successfully applied to the direct determination of NOR in pharmaceutical preparations and cross-validated by UPLC.

Geneticization in MIM/OMIM®? Exploring Historic and Epistemic Drivers of Contemporary Understandings of Genetic Disease.,Rachel A Ankeny,"Prior to the genomic sequencing era, the bible for those working in clinical genetics was McKusick's Mendelian Inheritance in Man (MIM), which appeared in multiple editions between the 1960s and the late 1990s. This catalogue was organized according to general patterns of inheritance and focused on phenotypes. Beginning in the mid-1980s, it was replaced by Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM®), a continuously updated catalogue documenting molecular relationships between genetic variation and phenotypic expression. This paper explores this resource's evolution with attention to how disease is distinguished from clinically irrelevant variation and how phenotypic similarities are captured in cases where there is no obvious genotypic association. It is argued that hybrid compromises are encoded into OMIM®; in addition to serving its key original purpose of being a diagnostic catalogue, it also began to record detectable variations in the genome even if they were not known to be associated with phenotypically visible disorders or even phenotypic variations. Although the impacts of geneticization have been well recognized, particularly in popular media, this example allows exploration of some of the historic, epistemic, and methodological causes that underlie tendencies toward disease geneticization in contemporary medicine, while highlighting that such gene-focused strategies may in fact be warranted in some contexts.",No date available,The Journal of medicine and philosophy,"Victor McKusick, clinical genetics, disease, genetic variation, geneticization","Chromosome Mapping, Disease, Genetic Diseases, Inborn, Genetic Variation, Human Genetics, Humans, Medicalization, Phenotype, Reference Books, Medical",10.1093/jmp/jhx013,"The University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia."

Gender differences in approaches to self-management of poor sleep in later life.,"Susan Venn, Robert Meadows, Sara Arber","In this paper we seek to understand the influence of gender on the different approaches to managing poor sleep by older men and women through the conceptual framework of existing theoretical debates on medicalization, healthicization and 'personalization'. In-depth interviews undertaken between January and July 2008 with 62 people aged 65-95 who were experiencing poor sleep, revealed that the majority of older men and women resisted the medicalization of poor sleep, as they perceived sleep problems in later life were an inevitable consequence of ageing. However, older men and women engaged differently with the healthicization of poor sleep, with women far more likely than men to explore a range of alternative sleep remedies, such as herbal supplements, and were also much more likely than men to engage in behavioural practices to promote good sleep, and to avoid practices which prevented sleep. Women situated 'sleep' alongside more abstract discussions of 'diet' and health behaviours and drew on the discourses of the media, friends, family and their own experiences to create 'personalized' strategies, drawn from a paradigm of healthicization. Men, however, solely relied on the 'body' to indicate when sleep was needed and gauged their sleep needs largely by how they felt, and were able to function the following day.",2012,Social science & medicine (1982),No keywords,"Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Aging, Attitude to Health, Female, Humans, Male, Medicalization, Qualitative Research, Self Care, Sex Factors, Sleep Wake Disorders",10.1016/j.socscimed.2012.09.037,"Centre for Research on Ageing and Gender (CRAG), Department of Sociology, University of Surrey, Guildford GU2 7XH, UK. s.venn@surrey.ac.uk"

Three different paper substrates: A (uncoated woodfree paper), B (triple-coated inkjet paper) and C (double-coated sheet fed offset paper) were used as porous model carriers for drug delivery. Active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) containing solutions were printed onto 1 cm × 1 cm substrate areas using an inkjet printer. The printed APIs were coated with water insoluble polymeric films of different thickness using flexographic printing. All substrates were characterized with respect to wettability, surface roughness, air permeability, and cell toxicity. In addition, content uniformity and release profiles of the produced solid dosage forms before and after coating were studied. The substrates were nontoxic for the human cell line assayed. Substrate B was smoothest and least porous. The properties of substrates B and C were similar, whereas those of substrate A differed significantly from those of B, C. The release kinetics of both printed APIs was slowest from substrate B before and after coating with the water insoluble polymer film, following by substrate C, whereas substrate A showed the fastest release. The release rate decreased with increasing polymer coating film thickness. The printed solid dosage forms showed excellent content uniformity.

To begin to redress this lack this paper analyses newsprint media's use of metaphors that re/describe and construct realities of ADHD with a medicalizing effect. The interdisciplinary team used the Factiva<sup>TM</sup> database to locate and review 453 articles published in Australian national and metropolitan newspapers during the decade 1999-2009. Data analysis involved generating statistical descriptions of the dataset according to attributes such as: date, state, newspaper titles and author names. This was followed by inductive analysis of article content. Content analysis revealed pervasive and striking use of metaphor in newsprint media reporting of ADHD content, especially when describing health professionals, educators, parents and children. This collection of metaphors was striking, and while the metaphors deployed were varied, this diversity seemed underscored by a common functionality that increased the risk that child behaviour was explained using medicalized knowledge. We contend that these metaphors collectively and coherently functioned to simplify and delimit meanings of children's health and behaviour to favour depictions that medicalize problems of children and childhood.",No date available,International journal of qualitative studies on health and well-being,"ADHD, child behaviour, medicalization, metaphor, newsprint media","Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity, Australia, Child, Child Behavior, Courage, Criminals, Humans, Medicalization, Newspapers as Topic",1298262,"a School of Education , University of Wollongong , Wollongong , Australia., b Centre for Health and Social Research , Australian Catholic University , Melbourne , Australia., c School of Medicine , University of Wollongong , Wollongong , Australia., a School of Education , University of Wollongong , Wollongong , Australia."

What exactly does customisation mean in this context; how does it relate to the medicalisation of sleep; and how salient or significant are these trends to date in the 24/7 society? These are the key questions this paper seeks to address, taking workplace napping and wakefulness promoting drugs amongst the 'healthy' as our comparative case studies. Both we argue, despite their apparent differences and embryonic status to date, provide alternative routes to broadly similar ends. Namely they customise our sleep patterns and practices to fit around the escalating temporal demands of daily life, thereby helping remedy the increasing misalignment between biological and social time. Each, moreover, seeks to improve or optimise safety, productivity and performance in late modern society, where alertness is prized, sleepiness is problematised and vigilance is valorised.

The medicalisation of health inequalities and the English NHS: the role of resource allocation.,"Sheena Asthana, Alex Gibson, Joyce Halliday","Tackling health inequalities (HI) has become a key policy objective in England in recent years. Yet, despite the wide-ranging policy response of the 1997-2010 Labour Government, socio-economic variations in health continued to widen. In this paper, we seek to explore why. We propose that a meta-narrative has emerged in which the health problems facing England's most deprived areas, and the solution to those problems, have increasingly come to be linked to levels of National Health Service (NHS) funding. This has been, in part, a response to key shortcomings in previous rounds of resource allocation. The very significant sums of money allocated with respect to 'health inequalities' reflects and reinforces the belief that the NHS can and should play a central role in promoting health equity. This medicalisation of HI focuses attention on the role of individual risk factors that lend themselves to medical management, but effectively sidelines the macroprocesses of social inequality, legitimising the kind of society that neo-liberal government has produced in the United Kingdom - one in which health (like other assets) has become a matter of individual and not collective responsibility.",2012,"Health economics, policy, and law",No keywords,"England, Health Care Rationing, Health Policy, Health Status Disparities, Humans, Medicalization, Resource Allocation, State Medicine",10.1017/S1744133112000126,"Faculty of Health, Education and Society, University of Plymouth, Plymouth, UK. sasthana@plymouth.ac.uk"

Determination of aerosol oxidative activity using silver nanoparticle aggregation on paper-based analytical devices.,"Wijitar Dungchai, Yupaporn Sameenoi, Orawon Chailapakul, John Volckens, Charles S Henry","Airborne particulate matter (PM) pollution significantly impacts human health, but the cellular mechanisms of PM-induced toxicity remain poorly understood. A leading hypothesis on the effects of inhaled PM involves the generation of cellular oxidative stress. To investigate PM-induced oxidative stress, analytical methods have been developed to study the chemical oxidation of dithiothreitol (DTT) in the presence of PM. Although DTT readily reacts with several forms of reactive oxygen species, this molecule is not endogenously produced in biological systems. Glutathione (GSH), on the other hand, is an endogenous antioxidant that is produced throughout the body and is directly involved in combating oxidative stress in the lungs and other tissues. We report here a new method for measuring aerosol oxidative activity that uses silver nanoparticle (AgNP) aggregation coupled to glutathione (GSH) oxidation in a paper-based analytical device. In this assay, the residual reduced GSH from the oxidation of reduced GSH to its disulfide induces the aggregation of AgNPs on a paper-based analytical device, which produces a reddish-brown product. Two methods for aerosol oxidative reactivity are presented: one based on change in color intensity using a traditional paper-based techniques and one based on the length of the color product formed using a distance-based device. These methods were validated against traditional spectroscopic assays for DTT and GSH that employ Elman's reagent. No significant difference was found between the levels measured by all three GSH methods (our two paper-based devices and the traditional method) at the 95% confidence level. PM reactivity towards GSH was less than towards DTT most likely due to the difference in the oxidation potential between the two molecules.",No date available,The Analyst,No keywords,"Aerosols, Chemistry Techniques, Analytical, Nanoparticles, Oxidation-Reduction, Paper, Silver",10.1039/c3an01235b,"Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi, Prachautid Road, Thungkru, Bangkok, 10140, Thailand."
A novel use of Moringa oleifera seed powder in enhancing the primary treatment of paper mill effluent.,"Soumia Boulaadjoul, Hassiba Zemmouri, Zoubida Bendjama, Nadjib Drouiche","In this study, Moringa oleifera (M. oleifera) performance as an eco-friendly coagulant in the enhanced primary treatment of paper mill effluent was investigated. Its performance in terms of turbidity removal and COD abatement was examined. Local M. oleifera seed powder from ADRAR-city, South of Algeria, was used. Conventional jar tests were conducted for enhancing the primary treatment of paper mill effluent from paper factory. For this reason, comparative coagulation tests were performed using aluminum sulfate (alum). Indeed, in terms of turbidity abatement, 96.02% and 97.1% were obtained for Moringa and alum, respectively. However, in the case of COD abatement, the abatement rate of M. oleifera seeds was slightly higher than that of alum, 97.28% and 92.67%, respectively. Because M. oleifera is a natural resource that is locally available, an eco-friendly coagulant, non-toxic, and biodegradable and does not affect the pH of water; thus, its use allows to avoid numerous disadvantages of conventional coagulants like alum.",2018,Chemosphere,"Alum, Coagulation-flocculation, M. oleifera, Paper mill effluent, Primary treatment","Industrial Waste, Moringa oleifera, Paper, Plant Extracts, Powders",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.04.123,"Laboratoire des Sciences et de Genie des Procédés Industriels, Faculté de Génie Mécanique et de Génie des Procédés, (USTHB), BP 32, 16111 Algiers, Algeria., Laboratoire des Sciences et de Genie des Procédés Industriels, Faculté de Génie Mécanique et de Génie des Procédés, (USTHB), BP 32, 16111 Algiers, Algeria.

Test Sample for the Spatially Resolved Quantification of Illicit Drugs on Fingerprints Using Imaging Mass Spectrometry.,"Shin Muramoto, Thomas P Forbes, Arian C van Asten, Greg Gillen","A novel test sample for the spatially resolved quantification of illicit drugs on the surface of a fingerprint using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) and desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (DESI-MS) was demonstrated. Calibration curves relating the signal intensity to the amount of drug deposited on the surface were generated from inkjet-printed arrays of cocaine, methamphetamine, and heroin with a deposited-mass ranging nominally from 10 pg to 50 ng per spot. These curves were used to construct concentration maps that visualized the spatial distribution of the drugs on top of a fingerprint, as well as being able to quantify the amount of drugs in a given area within the map. For the drugs on the fingerprint on silicon, ToF-SIMS showed great success, as it was able to generate concentration maps of all three drugs. On the fingerprint on paper, only the concentration map of cocaine could be constructed using ToF-SIMS and DESI-MS, as the signals of methamphetamine and heroin were completely suppressed by matrix and substrate effects. Spatially resolved quantification of illicit drugs using imaging mass spectrometry is possible, but the choice of substrates could significantly affect the results.",No date available,Analytical chemistry,No keywords,"Biomimetic Materials, Calibration, Dermatoglyphics, Illicit Drugs, Mass Spectrometry, Molecular Imaging, Paper, Sebum, Silicon, Surface Properties",No DOI available,

A procedure for drug screening without the need to transport urines: use of ion exchange papers and hemagglutination inhibition.,G J Alexander,"A procedure was devised for screening for drug abuse in urine specimens by adsorbing the drugs onto papers loaded with ion-exchange resin. The drugs were then eluted from the papers into aqueous saline buffers, which were analyzed by hemagglutination inhibition with antisera specific for morphine, methadone, or barbiturates. The procedure combines the convenience of the ion-exchange papers with the precision and sensitivity of the immunoassay. The preliminary treatment consists of local treatment of urine specimens collected at many distant clinics with ion exchange papers that adsorb 50-65% of alkaloid drugs and 25% of barbiturates and can be shipped, after drying, in simple envelopes by regular mail to a central analytical laboratory for processing. At the central laboratory, portions of specimens are reconstituted in aqueous saline buffers, while drugs from other portions are extracted with solvents at appropriate pH. Drugs are detected in the reconstituted aqueous media by hemagglutination inhibition and spectrophotofluorimetry and confirmed in the solvent extracts by thin-layer chromatography. Recovery of labeled drugs after this treatment and urine screening data showed that the procedure is safe, convenient, and reliable in the case of opiate alkaloids, methadone, amphetamines, and phenothiazine tranquilizers but is less suitable for detection of barbiturates.",No date available,Clinical toxicology,No keywords,"Chromatography, Ion Exchange, Chromatography, Paper, Hemagglutination Inhibition Tests, Humans, Methods, Pharmaceutical Preparations",No DOI available,
Hydrophobization and antimicrobial activity of chitosan and paper-based packaging material.,"Nicolas Bordenave, Stephane Grelier, Veronique Coma","This study reports the elaboration of water-resistant, antimicrobial, chitosan and paper-based materials as environmentally friendly food packaging materials. Two types of papers were coated with chitosan-palmitic acid emulsions or with a blend of chitosan and O,O'-dipalmitoylchitosan (DPCT). Micromorphology studies showed that inclusion of hydrophobic compounds into the chitosan matrix was enhanced by grafting them onto chitosan and that this led to their penetration of the paper's core. Compared to chitosan-coated papers, the coating of chitosan-palmitic emulsion kept vapor-barrier properties unchanged (239 and 170 g.m(-2).d(-1) versus 241 and 161 g.m(-2).d(-1)), while the coating of chitosan-DPCT emulsion dramatically deteriorated them (441 and 442 g.m(-2).d(-1)). However, contact angle measurements (110-120 degrees after 1 min) and penetration dynamics analysis showed that both strategies improved liquid-water resistance of the materials.

Determination of color developers replacing bisphenol A in thermal paper receipts using diode array and Corona charged aerosol detection-A German market analysis 2018/2019.,"Martin Eckardt, Marie Kubicova, Duyen Tong, Thomas J Simat","Thermal papers (e.g. point of sale receipts, adhesive labels, tickets) significantly contribute to contamination of paper material cycles and the environment with substances of (eco-) toxicological concern. In particular, they contain color developers like endocrine disrupting bisphenols in typical concentrations of about 1-2 percent per weight (wt%). Bisphenol A (BPA) was used as the common color developer over the last decades, but it will be restricted for thermal paper application in the European Union to a limit of 0.02 wt% from 2020 onwards. Consequently, a variety of BPA substituents such as bisphenol S (BPS) and its derivatives gain importance in thermal paper application. In this study, a rapid, reliable and cost-effective method for identification and quantification of BPA, alternative color developers and related substances like sensitizers is presented based on HPLC separation coupled with diode array detection (DAD) and Corona charged aerosol detection (CAD). Quantification was performed with regard to the intended use of the substances in thermal papers. Besides traditional UV external calibration using reference standards, alternative quantification approaches, in particular UV chromophore concentration for BPS derivatives and CAD universal response technique for low-volatile color developers, were applied and compared in order to allow quantification without reference substances. A market analysis for intended used color developers and sensitizers was performed on thermal paper samples (n = 211) collected in Germany during 2018 and 2019. Pergafast 201 (in 41.7% of the samples) was the most common color developer with concentrations above 0.02 wt%, followed by BPA (36.0%), BPS (13.3%) and other BPS derivatives known as D8, D-90, BPS-MAE and TGSA, that are mainly present in adhesive labels.

"A suspending-droplet mode paper-based microfluidic platform for low-cost, rapid, and convenient detection of lead(II) ions in liquid solution.","Han Sun, Wanbo Li, Zhen-Zhen Dong, Chong Hu, Chung-Hang Leung, Dik-Lung Ma, Kangning Ren","A paper-based microfluidic device based on unconventional principle was developed and used to detect lead ions through a two-step process including heated incubation and subsequent mixing. The device was made by generating a superhydrophobic pattern, which defines channel and reservoir barriers, on a water-impermeable paper substrate, followed by loading and drying the reagents in the defined reservoirs. Different from the conventional paper-based devices that are made of water-permeable paper, the as-prepared device holds water drops in discrete reservoirs, and the water drops will not move unless the device is titled along the direction of the predefined channels. In this way, the liquid samples applied onto the device are handled as individual drops and could be stored, transported, and mixed on demand. Different from the conventional paper-based devices that use capillary force to drive liquid, our new device uses wetting and gravity as driving force. We name this operation principle suspending-droplet mode paper-based device (SD-μPAD). The use of a Teflon contact-printing stamp makes the production of such devices rapid, cost efficient, and mass productive.

Inkjet printing of drug substances and use of porous substrates-towards individualized dosing.,"Niklas Sandler, Anni Määttänen, Petri Ihalainen, Leif Kronberg, Axel Meierjohann, Tapani Viitala, Jouko Peltonen","Medicines are most often oral solid dosage forms made into tablets or capsules, and there is little room for individualized doses. The drug substance and additives are processed through multiple production phases, including complex powder handling steps. In drug manufacturing, the control of the solid-state properties of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) is essential and it offers opportunities for enhancement of drug delivery systems. In this context, inkjet printing technologies have emerged over the last decades in pharmaceutical and biological applications and offer solutions for controlling material and product characteristics with high precision. Here we report the concept of conventional inkjet printing technology to produce printable pharmaceutical dosage forms on porous substrates. Data are shown to demonstrate inkjet printing of APIs into paper substrates, and how the model drug substances (paracetamol, theophylline, and caffeine) are penetrating the porous substrates used. The method enables controlling not only the deposition but also the crystallization of the drug substances. We anticipate that the inkjet printing approach has immense potential in making sophisticated drug delivery systems by use of porous substrates in the future.

A paper-based analytical device coupled with electrochemical detection for the determination of dexamethasone and prednisolone in adulterated traditional medicines.,"Vitsarut Primpray, Orawon Chailapakul, Manabu Tokeshi, Theerasak Rojanarata, Wanida Laiwattanapaisal","The adulteration of herbal medicines by dexamethasone or prednisolone is regarded as a serious problem in many communities. Herein, a novel platform for the separation and quantification of both target steroids in herbal medicines based on electrochemical paper-based analytical devices (ePADs) has been created. The ePAD was composed of Whatman SG81 chromatography paper, 3D-printed devices and a commercial screen-printed electrode. Whatman SG81 silica-coated paper was used for the separation of dexamethasone and prednisolone based on the difference in their partition coefficients during the flow of the mobile phase. The optimal mobile phase was composed of 60% ethyl acetate in cyclohexane and required 7 min for separation. The separated steroids on the paper were then quantified by electrochemical detection using differential pulse voltammetry, in which the 3D-printed devices facilitated the measurement. Analytical detection ranges of 10-500 μg mL<sup>-1</sup> were obtained for both dexamethasone and prednisolone (r<sup>2 </sup>= 0.988 and 0.994, respectively). The limits of detection for dexamethasone and prednisolone were 3.59 and 11.98 μg mL<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, whereas the limits of quantification were 6.00 and 20.02 μg mL<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The amounts of both target steroids derived from real herbal medicine samples determined by the proposed method were comparable to those obtained with assays using standard high-performance liquid chromatography.

Removal of copper from aqueous solution using newspaper pulp as an adsorbent.,"S Chakravarty, S Pimple, Hema T Chaturvedi, S Singh, K K Gupta","Newspaper pulp was found to be a potential adsorbent for removal of copper from aqueous medium. Detail adsorption study of Cu on newspaper pulp was investigated. Batch adsorption study was carried out as a function of contact time, adsorbent dose, temperature (303-323 K). The experimental data was analyzed using Freundlich, Langmuir, Dubinin-Radushkevich (D-R) and Redlich-Peterson (R-P) isotherm models. It was found that Freundlich, Langmuir and R-P models fitted well. pH variation study revealed that the adsorption increased with increase in pH of the solution. Maximum loading capacity was found to be 30 mg g(-1) at 20 mg L(-1) of initial Cu concentration. Adsorption data were analyzed using two kinetic models, Lagergren first order and pseudo second order. It was observed that pseudo second order represented the best correlation. Langmuir isotherm was used to obtain the thermodynamic parameters such as free energy (DeltaG degrees ), enthalpy (DeltaH degrees ) and entropy (DeltaS degrees ) of adsorption. The negative value of free energy and positive value of enthalpy change indicate that the adsorption of Cu on newspaper pulp is a spontaneous process and endothermic. The results of activation energy also confirmed that the adsorption of Cu on newspaper pulp is physical in nature.

Chemical fingerprint analysis for quality assessment and control of Bansha herbal tea using paper spray mass spectrometry.,"Jiewei Deng, Yunyun Yang","Chemical fingerprinting methodology is an approach for quality assessment and control of herbal medicines and related products based on the holistic chemical profile obtained by various analytical techniques. This study demonstrates the first application of paper spray mass spectrometry (PS-MS) as a chemical fingerprinting methodology for tracing the origins, establishing the authenticity, and assessing the overall quality of a famous herbal product, Bansha herbal tea (BHT). A negative ion PS-MS spectrum yielded the best chemical profiling information and was most appropriate for fingerprint analysis of BHT. In addition to the identification of active ingredients, various compounds present in BHT were simultaneously detected without any sample pretreatment and chromatographic separation, providing valuable information for the quality assessment and control of this herbal product. According to the principal component analysis of the PS-MS fingerprints, two sources of commercially available BHT products made by different manufacturers were easily differentiated. Qualified and expired products from the two manufacturers were also successfully distinguished, and the consistency of the quality between the manufacturers was assessed.

Comparison of tablets and paper discs for antibiotic sensitivity testing.,"D F Brown, D Kothari","The value of tablets and paper discs as reservoirs of antimicrobial agents for use in sensitivity testing was compared. Antibiotics that were unstable in paper discs showed no demonstrable loss of activity in tablets over a period of 50 days under adverse storage conditions. The antibiotic content of commercially prepared tablets is very high in comparison with the accepted content of paper discs used in Britain, but not all of the agent is released from tablets during tests. Comparison of the size of zones of inhibition around tablets and standard paper discs indicated that the amount of the various agents released from the tablets varied between 2-6% and 69% of the stated content. In tests of the sensitivity of a range of common pathogenic organisms, the results obtained with the tablet method--when interpreted as recommended by the manufacturer--were generally similar to those obtained with a paper disc method commonly used in British laboratories. In 47% of tests with aminoglycoside antibiotics, however, strains sensitive by the disc method were 'intermediate' or resistant by the tablet method. As with paper discs, it was necessary to press the tablets on to the medium. With adjustment of the 'effective antibiotic content of tablets to bring it into line with the accepted content in paper discs, the stability of antibiotics in the tablets might make them an acceptable alternative to paper discs.",No date available,Journal of clinical pathology,No keywords,"Anti-Bacterial Agents, Drug Stability, Indicators and Reagents, Microbial Sensitivity Tests, Paper, Reagent Strips, Tablets",No DOI available,

Vegetal fiber paper matrix impregnated with silica gel for benzene removal.,"Xuannan Wu, Tianshu Ge, Yanjun Dai, Ruzhu Wang","Removing benzene from indoor space plays an important role in indoor air purification. A novel filter with vegetal fiber paper (VFP) as matrix hosting silica gel is proposed in this paper for benzene removal. In order to investigate the feasibility and performance of this idea, firstly, three pieces of VFP samples impregnated with different amounts of silica gel are fabricated and their benzene adsorption quantities are tested. The results show that three times is recommended as the optimal number for impregnating. The VFP sample impregnated with silica gel after the third impregnating exhibits commendable coating stability and good benzene adsorption performance. Additionally, at low relative pressure (P<sub>b</sub> /P<sub>s</sub>  ≤ 0.05), the experimental data of benzene adsorption isotherms fit well with the Langmuir model with R<sup>2</sup> greater than 0.97.

Aiming for a moving target: challenges with impactor measurements of MDI aerosols.,Stephen W Stein,"Experiments were conducted to illustrate some of the challenges associated with measuring dynamic MDI aerosols. Experimental HFA-134a solution MDIs containing 8 or 20% ethanol were measured using the Andersen cascade impactor using three different inlets. It was demonstrated that the size distribution of MDI aerosols changes substantially during the measurement process. The measured size distribution was shown to be dependent on the degree of evaporation that has occurred prior to size measurement. Additionally, the degree of evaporation prior to measurement also influences the number of modes present in the measured size distribution. While MDI aerosols appeared to have a separate large particle mode when measured using the U.S. Pharmacopeial induction port (""USP inlet""; [U.S. Pharmacopeia, 1996.

Determination of Cr(VI) concentration in diluted samples based on the paper test strip method.,"F Kong, Y Ni","At present, there are many methods for Cr(VI) concentration determination in diluted samples, however, these methods have their own inherent drawbacks, such as long response time, complicated pretreatment, expensive equipment etc. In this paper, a paper-based test strip method specific for determination of diluted Cr(VI) samples was developed. In this method, Aliquat 336, as an anion exchanger was loaded into filter paper to form a test strip. This test strip was used to pre-concentrate Cr(VI) when contacting with the diluted Cr(VI)-containing solution. The Cr(VI)-containing test strip was then immersed into a diphenylcarbazide (DPC) solution (a color forming solution), and the color intensity was correlated to the Cr(VI) concentration. The detection range of the present method was found to be 0.02-1.50 mg/L. The results also showed that the method gave a high selectivity for Cr(VI) in the diluted samples to be tested.

'Learning disabilities' as a 'black box': on the different conceptions and constructions of a popular clinical entity in Israel.,Ofer Katchergin,"This article aims to stimulate new thinking about learning disabilities than is customary in local literature. Previous educational and psychological studies concerning learning disabilities regarded them as if they were objective categories with formal definitions and criteria accepted in scholarly literature. Contrary to that, this article explores the various conceptions, constructions, and meanings of learning disabilities that comprise the narrative descriptions and explanations of didactic diagnosticians. For this purpose, 50 in-depth interviews were conducted. There are four sections. Part One lays out the theoretical and methodological background of the sociological and discursive debate about learning disabilities. Part Two explores the various main thematic aspects and narrative strategies that were used by the diagnosticians in their construction of their purportedly 'objective', 'a-historical', 'a-political' experts' narrative. The third part reveals the polyphonic multifaceted nature of the learning disabilities construct. The experts' narrative undermines the objective and homogeneous definitions in the literature by uncovering learning disabilities' heterogeneous meaning repertoire. This repertoire consists, among others, of conceptualizing disability as a 'disease', a 'symptom', a 'genetic defect', a 'disorder', an 'educational difficulty', a 'variance', and even a 'gift'. This part also reveals the experts' narrative reaction strategies to the aforementioned polyphonic spectacle. It is revealed that the interviewees' narrative deconstructs the 'scientific factual nature' of the clinical categories. The fourth part highlights a central paradox in the expert narrative: The tension between the narrative stigmatic-labeling aspects and the destigmatic-'liberating' aspects.

Using Adhesive Patterning to Construct 3D Paper Microfluidic Devices.,"Brent Kalish, Hideaki Tsutsui","We demonstrate the use of patterned aerosol adhesives to construct both planar and nonplanar 3D paper microfluidic devices. By spraying an aerosol adhesive through a metal stencil, the overall amount of adhesive used in assembling paper microfluidic devices can be significantly reduced. We show on a simple 4-layer planar paper microfluidic device that the optimal adhesive application technique and device construction style depends heavily on desired performance characteristics. By moderately increasing the overall area of a device, it is possible to dramatically decrease the wicking time and increase device success rates while also reducing the amount of adhesive required to keep the device together. Such adhesive application also causes the adhesive to form semi-permanent bonds instead of permanent bonds between paper layers, enabling single-use devices to be non-destructively disassembled after use. Nonplanar 3D origami devices also benefit from the semi-permanent bonds during folding, as it reduces the likelihood that unrelated faces may accidently stick together. Like planar devices, nonplanar structures see reduced wicking times with patterned adhesive application vs uniformly applied adhesive.",2016,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,No keywords,"Adhesives, Aerosols, Lab-On-A-Chip Devices, Microfluidic Analytical Techniques, Paper",53805,"Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of California, Riverside., Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of California, Riverside; Department of Bioengineering, University of California, Riverside; Stem Cell Center, University of California, Riverside; htsutsui@engr.ucr.edu."
Identification of odor signature chemicals in cocaine using solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography and detector-dog response to isolated compounds spiked on U.S. paper currency.,"Kenneth G Furton, Yi-Cheng Hong, Ya-Li Hsu, Tianying Luo, Stefan Rose, John Walton","Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) combined with gas chromatography (GC) is optimized and applied to the analysis of street-cocaine samples followed by the field-testing of isolated chemicals using certified detector dogs. SPME proves to be a very sensitive and rapid method for isolating odor chemicals from street-cocaine samples. SPME-GC and activated charcoal strip (ACS)-SPME-GC signature profile methods are developed for the detection and quantitation of cocaine-odor chemicals, including the optimization of controllable variables such as fiber chemistry, extraction time, and desorption time. The volatile odor chemicals in representative illicit cocaine samples are identified and quantitated by the ACS-SPME-GC signature profile method and direct injection. Field tests with drug detector dogs show methyl benzoate to be the dominant signature odor chemical along with cocaine on U.S. currency at a threshold level of approximately 1-10 microg when spiked or when 10 ng/s methyl benzoate is diffused from polymer bottles, which is required in order to initiate an alert.

Coupling frontal elution paper chromatography with desorption corona beam ionization mass spectrometry for rapid analysis of chlorphenamine in herbal medicines and dietary supplements.,"Yun-Qing Huang, Jing-Qing You, Junsheng Zhang, Wenjian Sun, Li Ding, Yu-Qi Feng","We developed a convenient method by coupling frontal elution paper chromatography with desorption corona beam ionization mass spectrometry (DCBI-MS) for rapid determination of chlorphenamine added in herbal medicines or dietary supplements. In this method, the ethanol extract of the herbal products was spotted directly onto an isosceles triangular filter paper sheet, and then the paper sheet was developed under strong elution condition with the sample zone migrating at the solvent front. The analyte was finally condensed at the V-shaped tip which could then be placed under the visible plasma beam of DCBI for ionization. The overall procedure took less than 5 min. The frontal elution paper chromatography on a triangular plate used in this work improved the signal intensity of chlorphenamine by 30-fold due to the analyte condensing at the tip and the reduction of the background suppression. Furthermore, the paper sheet also functioned as a filter in the analysis of solid or powder samples, which can increase the analytical throughput by omitting the step of centrifugation. The proposed method in current study was successfully applied in the determination of chlorphenamine in herbal medicines. Chlorphenamine was detected in four of the twelve types of herbal medicines examined in this study. The limit of detection was 200 ng/mL (2.0 ng absolute) in full-scan positive-ion mode and the linear range was from 5.0 μg/mL to 50 μg/mL with satisfactory linear coefficient (R(2) (the square of the correlation coefficient)=0.895).

"Surface-enhanced Raman scattering of a series of n-hydroxybenzoic acids (n = P, M and O) on the silver nano-particles.","Di Wu, Yan Fang","Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectra of a series of n-hydroxybenzoic acids (n-HBA, n = P, M and O) adsorbed on the silver nano-particles were studied, respectively, in the silver colloidal solution and on the dried silver-coated filter paper. On the same substrate, the different molecules' SERS spectra were different, while on the different substrates the same molecules' SERS spectra were also different. Significant changes were found in the SERS spectra of PHBA molecules adsorbed on the two substrates, and the changes found in MHBA's spectra on two substrates were next to PHBA's, while almost no changes were found in the spectra of OHBA molecules. Moreover, it was found, on the filter paper, that the SERS spectra of the same molecules would change with the coverage density of the silver nano-particles. The analyses showed that the origins of these changes were the different adsorption behavior of molecules adsorbed on the silver nano-particles. Because in these three molecules the relative positions of the carboxyls and hydroxyls on the benzenes are different, the adsorption behaviors of these three molecules adsorbed on the silver surfaces are also different. The experimental results suggest that the surface characteristic of the substrate and the surface configuration of the adsorbate could exert a great influence on the adsorption behavior of the adsorbates on the substrates.",No date available,"Spectrochimica acta.

Comparison of the repair of permanent tympanic membrane perforations by hydrocolloidal dressing and paper patch.,"O Spandow, S Hellström, M Dahlström, L Bohlin","Thirty consecutive patients with permanent perforations of their tympanic membranes (TM) present from 2.5 to 50 years (mean 18.7 years) were admitted to a prospective study using two alternative methods of dressings for closure of the perforations. An adhesive-coated hydrocolloid material was compared with a conventional dressing of vaseline impregnated rice paper patch after de-epithelialization of the perforation border. Nine of the permanent TM perforations (30 per cent), five with the hydrocolloidal dressing and four with the rice paper patch had healed when followed-up after one year. The size of eight of the central perforations that had healed was equal to or less than 25 per cent of the TM. Also one perforation with a size of 65 per cent had healed. Seven perforations were located in the posterior part of the TM: four in the posterior-superior quadrant, one in the inferior quadrant, one had engulfed the posterior half of the TM and one included the anterior-inferior quadrant. Only two perforations out of 14, with a size of 25 per cent or less, located in the anterior-inferior quadrant, healed. No significant difference was demonstrated between the two types of dressings. Both groups noted an immediate improvement in hearing of 10.8 and 9.3 dB, respectively, after application of the dressing. The study demonstrates that application of an occlusive dressing or paper patch in 30 per cent of patients can promote the healing of long-standing perforations. The chances for healing are better if the perforation is located in the posterior part of the TM.

We will describe analytically the singularities involved in the body perception and the alimentary context by health professionals and their patients. We emphasize that the criteria of perception and moral values that encourage social positions of health professionals and recipients of their actions precluded the institutionalization of a medical vision.

When external light of moderate intensity (∼0.2 W cm(-2)) strikes the structure, colloids inside the liquid layer will be assembled to locations with an optimal absorption. When this system is exposed to continuous laser pulses, more than 18,000 times of reversible responses are recorded, where the system requests 20 ms to start the response and another 160 ms to complete.

These protein targets are usually divided in three main classes, A, B and C, based on sequence similarity, but they can also be grouped pharmacologically based on endogenous ligand characteristics. In this paper, we specifically focus on compounds able to recognize two different classes or different pharmacological clusters within the same class.

"Improvement of the attractiveness of spodoptera littoralis sex pheromone, and its possible use in safety belts around cultivated areas to control the pest in Israel.","S Neumark, R M Waters, M Jacobson","A comparison of the field attractiveness of five samples of American-synthesized and one sample of Japanese-synthesized (Z,E)-9,11-tetradecadien-1-01 acetate (9,11-TDDA), the sex pheromone of Spodoptera littoralis Boisd. and S. litura (F.), showed that traps baited with one of the American-produced samples and the Japanese product were equally effective in attracting and capturing S. littoralis males in cotton and alfalfa fields of Israel. Optimum captures were obtained for periods up to three months with 4800 mug of 9,11-TDDA plus 8 mg of an antioxidant; higher doses were not advantageous. Paper squares were superior to two types of rubber septa and to closed polyethylene vials as dispensers for the pheromone; the polyethylene vials were least effective. In terms of numbers of moths captured, open polyethylene vials were as effective as paper dispensers when both were baited with 9-11-TDDA plus antioxidant. Admixture of (Z,E)-9,12-tetradecadien-1-o1 acetate (9,12-TDDA) with 9,11-TDDA was antagonistic at ratios of 1:20 and 1:50, but ratios from 1:500 to 1:1600 were synergistic, increasing moth catches up to 2.5-fold. Pheromone traps placed in Caesarea sand dunes located at least 3 km from the nearest host area captured larger numbers of males than traps placed in cultivated areas. It is therefore recommended that safety belts of pheromone traps, about 500 m apart, be used around cultivated areas to prevent invasion of the pest from outside and to attract males present inside such areas, thus reducing both the male population and mating through mass trapping and disruption of sex communication.",No date available,Environmental letters,No keywords,"Animals, Chemical Phenomena, Chemistry, Decanoic Acids, Drug Synergism, Insect Control, Israel, Lepidoptera, Male, Moths, Paper, Pharmaceutical Vehicles, Pheromones, Polyethylenes, Rubber",No DOI available,
Compliance spectrum as a drug fingerprint of drug intake and drug disposition.,"Olivier Barrière, Jun Li, Fahima Nekka","Since drug related variability arises from different origins, particularly driven by the behaviour or physiology of the patient, the problems of drug intake and drug disposition are separately presented in general. To overcome the potential drawbacks of this artificial split, we propose in this paper a combined illustrative approach, named compliance spectrum, such that these two subprocesses can be equitably studied and visualized. We construct the compliance spectrum based on the Bayesian decision method we previously developed for the inverse problem of patient compliance within the framework of Population-PK. This spectrum provides an intuitive and interactive way to evaluate the relationship between drug intake and drug disposition along with their consequences on PK profile.

Improved refining properties of pulps pretreated with ionic liquids under mild conditions.,"Zhiqiang Pang, Jiachuan Chen, Cuihua Dong, Guihua Yang, Yu Liu","Imidazolium-based ionic liquids (ILs), including 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (BmimCl) and 1-allyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (AmimCl), were used to improve the refining properties of pulps under mild conditions. Results showed that the macro appearance of pulps was virtually unchanged after pretreatment with ILs under mild conditions. In addition, chemical pulps pretreated with ILs are more suitable for pretreatment than chemimechanical pulps. Pretreatment with ILs facilitates the refining process by destroying hydrogen bonds, which exist extensively in fiber. At the same refining energy input, the Canada standard freeness (CSF) of refined pulp decreased with improved fiber quality. At identical CSF values, the energy consumed during refining significantly decreased because ILs pretreatment facilitated swelling and fibrillation. The viscosity of cellulose changed slightly after IL pretreatment. However, the crystallinity index and fines content decreased, and the micro appearance of the fiber surface changed.

Colloids engineering and filtration to enhance the sensitivity of paper-based biosensors.,"Ping Peng, Lauren Summers, Alexandra Rodriguez, Gil Garnier","Paper-based biosensors represent a disruptive technology by providing instantaneous and low-cost diagnostics for health and environmental applications. The lack of sensitivity can be an obstacle for this technology to compete with traditional analytical instrumentations. Aiming to improve the sensitivity of a paper-based colorimetric biosensor, we have applied colloids engineering in combination with filtration to lower the paper substrate backgrounds and optimize the immobilization of bio-molecules on paper. A model system consisting of an enzyme, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and an inorganic colloid, calcium carbonate (CC), flocculated by a cationic dimethylamino-ethyl-methacrylate polyacrylamide (CPAM), demonstrated that the optimized CC flocs are best for enhancing the detecting sensitivity of ALP. The CC floc structure on paper was optimized by modulating its structure in suspension. Subsequently, the filtration process and the wicking ability of paper enabled to freeze the deposited CC structure inherited from the suspension. The incorporation of biomolecules into the CC before immobilizing on paper through filtration provided not only a better microenvironment, but also a higher surface density of immobilized biomolecules. The ALP detection limit of 117 fmol per zone (5mm circle) in the current study was fifty times lower than that of the common soaking method for biomolecule immobilization. The minimum amount of biomolecules per unit substrate area required for detection was lowered by over an order of magnitude, compared with spotting methods (i.e. inkjet printing). The improvement was also demonstrated by the steepest slope of standard curve, the lowest background, and the highest activity of the bioactive paper probed with the diluted BCIP/NBT liquid substrates.",2011,"Colloids and surfaces.

Instant visual detection of picogram levels of trinitrotoluene by using luminescent metal-organic framework gel-coated filter paper.,"Ji Ha Lee, Sunwoo Kang, Jin Yong Lee, Justyn Jaworski, Jong Hwa Jung","There is an ongoing need for explosive detection strategies to uncover threats to human security including illegal transport and terrorist activities. The widespread military use of the explosive trinitrotoluene (TNT) for landmines poses another particular threat to human health in the form of contamination of the surrounding environment and groundwater. The detection of explosives, particularly at low picogram levels, by using a molecular sensor is seen as an important challenge. Herein, we report on the use of a fluorescent metal-organic framework hydrogel that exhibits a higher detection capability for TNT in the gel state compared with that in the solution state. A portable sensor prepared from filter paper coated by the hydrogel was able to detect TNT at the picogram level with a detection limit of 1.82 ppt (parts per trillon). Our results present a simple and new means to provide selective detection of TNT on a surface or in aqueous solution, as afforded by the unique molecular packing through the metal-organic framework structure in the gel formation and the associated photophysical properties. Furthermore, the rheological properties of the MOF-based gel were similar to those of a typical hydrogel.",2013,"Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)","explosives, gels, metal-organic frameworks, sensors, supramolecular chemistry","Equipment Design, Explosive Agents, Filtration, Humans, Hydrogels, Limit of Detection, Models, Molecular, Organometallic Compounds, Paper, Trinitrotoluene, Zinc",10.1002/chem.201301507,"Department of Chemistry and Research Institute of Natural Sciences, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju 660-701 (Korea), Fax: (+82) 55-772-1488."
Combining a hydrogel and an electrochemical biosensor to determine the extent of degradation of paper artworks.,"Laura Micheli, Claudia Mazzuca, Antonio Palleschi, Giuseppe Palleschi","Paper-based artworks are among the most valuable assets for transmission of knowledge. Historical paper is composed of different polysaccharides (e.g. cellulose), binders, and glues. During aging all of these components undergo several degradation processes, as a result of external and intrinsic causes, and these can compromise the state of conservation of the document. In this work, application of a new biotechnological strategy for paper artefact preservation is reported. By making use of innovative and non-invasive materials, for example appropriate hydrogels, in combination with selective electrochemical biosensors, it is possible to simultaneously verify the degradation condition of the paper artwork and then to efficiently clean it, while monitoring the process of removal of both pollution and degradation products. In this paper, we focus on specific examples in which such techniques have been applied to paper artworks and that illustrate the advantages and potential of this biotechnology compared with the traditional paper-cleaning methods currently in use.",2012,Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,No keywords,"Art, Biosensing Techniques, Electrochemical Techniques, Hydrogel, Polyethylene Glycol Dimethacrylate, Paper",10.1007/s00216-012-5885-y,"Department of Chemical Sciences and Technologies, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Via della Ricerca Scientifica, 00173 Rome, Italy. laura.micheli@uniroma2.it"
A two-layer diffusive model for describing the variability of transdermal drug permeation.,"Victor M Meidan, David Pritchard","There is mounting evidence that the permeability coefficients (k(p)) that describe any given transdermal drug permeation process generally follow some form of positively skewed, non-symmetrical distribution rather than a simple normal distribution. Yet a suitable theoretical treatment of this area has not been undertaken to date. In this paper, we describe a two-layer model that can explain five drugs'k(p) variabilities as measured in two previously published papers. The model shows why rapidly permeating drugs would tend to exhibit more symmetrical k(p) distributions while progressively more slowly permeating drugs would tend to exhibit progressively more positively skewed k(p) distributions.

Long-term effects of bleached kraft mill effluents on carbohydrate metabolism and hepatic xenobiotic biotransformation enzymes in fish.,"T Andersson, B E Bengtsson, L Förlin, J Härdig, A Larsson","In a laboratory investigation, fourhorn sculpin (Myoxocephalus quadricornis) were exposed for 5-9 months to waste water from pine and birch lines from a bleached kraft pulp plant. The bleached kraft mill effluents (BKME) affected both the carbohydrate metabolism and the xenobiotic metabolism. Thus, an elevated muscle glycogen content in fish exposed to effluent from the pine pulp line suggests a metabolic imbalance. A liver enlargement and a strong elevation of the hepatic cytochrome P-450-dependent ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activity after exposure to the bleached pine pulp effluents indicate the presence of cytochrome P-450-inducing agents in the BKME. The results also demonstrate that many physiological test parameters may be used as good indicators of sublethal disturbances in fish to BKME exposure.",No date available,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,No keywords,"Animals, Ascorbic Acid, Biotransformation, Carbohydrate Metabolism, Chemical Phenomena, Chemistry, Physical, Female, Fishes, Glycogen, Industrial Waste, Liver, Male, Mixed Function Oxygenases, Paper, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Water Pollutants, Water Pollutants, Chemical",No DOI available,
Modulated exponential films generated by surface acoustic waves and their role in liquid wicking and aerosolization at a pinned drop.,"Daniel Taller, David B Go, Hsueh-Chia Chang","The exponentially decaying acoustic pressure of scattered surface acoustic waves (SAWs) at the contact line of a liquid film pinned to filter paper is shown to sustain a high curvature conic tip with micron-sized modulations whose dimension grows exponentially from the tip. The large negative capillary pressure in the film, necessary for offsetting the large positive acoustic pressure at the contact line, also creates significant negative hydrodynamic pressure and robust wicking action through the paper. An asymptotic analysis of this intricate pressure matching between the quasistatic conic film and bulk drop shows that the necessary SAW power to pump liquid from the filter paper and aerosolize, expressed in terms of the acoustic pressure scaled by the drop capillary pressure, grows exponentially with respect to twice the acoustic decay constant multiplied by the drop length, with a universal preexponential coefficient. Global rapid aerosolization occurs at a SAW power twice as high, beyond which the wicking rate saturates.",2013,"Physical review.

A simple system to rapidly monitor activated sludge health and performance.,"F Archibald, M Méthot, F Young, M G Paice","A set of four assays designed to rapidly measure the health and biodegradative performance of pulp and paper mill activated sludges was developed. Three of the assays are specific oxygen uptake rates (SOURs) that measure the normal ""working"" aeration tank BOD (biochemical oxygen demand) removal rate (SOURAT), a near-maximum BOD removal rate (SOURNMAX), and a rate (SOURTOX) used in combination with the SOURNMAX to indicate the presence of toxic or inhibitory substances. The fourth assay is the specific adenosine triphosphate (SATP) content of the sludge, used as a measure of its viable cell content. Fresh biomass (sludge) samples from one laboratory reactor and four mill biotreatment systems were fed raw mill effluents and used to evaluate the four-assay set. The SOURAT values of all systems were 10-40% of their SOURNMAX values: thus the SOURAT:SOURNMAX ratios indicate that each system's free biodegradative capacity was far greater than its operating rate. It was demonstrated using phenol that the SOURNMAX:SOURTOX ratio can indicate the presence of substances toxic or inhibitory to the biomass. The results also indicated that the SOURNMAX is a much better indicator of improving or worsening sludge performance and capacity than the SOURAT. SATP was shown to be a useful monitor of the proportion of viable cells in an activated sludge and a toxicity indicator complementary to the SOURNMAX:SOURTOX ratio and similar in principle to the commercial Microtox toxicity test. This four-assay set was also applied to three practical situations: (a) at-mill monitoring of a biotreatment system; (b) effects of cold storage on biomass; and (c) effects of decreased BOD loading on biomass.",No date available,Water research,No keywords,"Adenosine Triphosphate, Aerobiosis, Biodegradation, Environmental, Biomass, Oxygen, Oxygen Consumption, Paper, Sewage, Suspensions, Waste Disposal, Fluid",No DOI available,"Pulp and Paper Research Institute of Canada (Paprican), Pointe Claire, Quebec. farchibald@paprican.ca"

However, since these materials are acrylic and plastic, the thickness and quality of those materials cause attenuation and scatter in itself. We developed a paper sheet phantom sealed with a pouch laminator, which can be a true radioactive source in air. In this study, the paper sheet phantom was compared to the acrylic liver phantom, with the thickness of 2 cm, which is commercially available. The results showed that although some scatter counts were contained within the image of the acrylic liver phantom, there were few scattered photons in the paper sheet phantom image. Furthermore, this laminated paper sheet phantom made handling of the source and its waste easier.

WTO accepts rules limiting medicine exports to poor countries.,John S James,"In a controversial decision on August 30, 2003, the World Trade Organization agreed to complex rules limiting the export of medications to developing countries. Reaction to the decision so far has shown a complete disconnect between trade delegates and the WTO, both of which praise the new rules as a humanitarian advance, and those working in treatment access in poor countries, who believe that they will effectively block treatment from reaching many who need it. We have prepared a background paper that analyzes this decision and its implications and offers the opinions of key figures on both sides of the debate. It is clear that the rules were largely written for and probably by the proprietary pharmaceutical industry, and imposed on the countries in the WTO mainly by the United States. The basic conflict is that this industry does not want the development of international trade in low-cost generic copies of its patented medicines--not even for poor countries, where little or no market exists. Yet millions of people die each year without medication for treatable conditions such as AIDS, and drug pricing remains one of several major obstacles to controlling global epidemics.",No date available,AIDS treatment news,No keywords,"Commerce, Developing Countries, International Cooperation, Pharmaceutical Preparations",No DOI available,

Shape Matters: A Neglected Feature of Medication Safety : Why Regulating the Shape of Medication Containers Can Improve Medication Safety.,"Yuval Bitan, Mark E Nunnally","This paper aims to highlight how to reduce medication errors through the implementation of human factors science to the design features of medication containers. Despite efforts to employ automation for increased safety and decreased workload, medication administration in hospital wards is still heavily dependent on human operators (pharmacists, nurses, physicians, etc.). Improving this multi-step process requires its being studied and designed as an interface in a complex socio-technical system. Human factors engineering, also known as ergonomics, involves designing socio-technical systems to improve overall system performance, and reduces the risk of system, and in particular, operator, failures. The incorporation of human factors principles into the design of the work environment and tools that are in use during medication administration could improve this process. During periods of high workload, the cognitive effort necessary to work through a very demanding process may overwhelm even expert operators. In such conditions, the entire system should facilitate the human operator's high level of performance. Regarding medications, clinicians should be provided with as many perceptual cues as possible to facilitate medication identification. Neglecting the shape of the container as one of the features that differentiates between classes of medications is a lost opportunity to use a helpful characteristic, and medication administration failures that happen in the absence of such intentional design arise from ""designer error"" rather than ""user error"". Guidelines that define a container's shape for each class of medication would compel pharmaceutical manufacturers to be compatible and would eliminate the confusion that arises when a hospital changes the supplier of a given medication.",2022,Journal of medical systems,"Human factors, Medication safety, Patient safety, Safety Management, Workload","Humans, Medication Errors, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Hospitals, Working Conditions, Automation, Medication Systems, Hospital",10.1007/s10916-022-01905-0,"Department of Health Policy and Management, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Be'er Sheva, Israel. yuval@bitan.net., Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperative Care and Pain Medicine, Neurology, Surgery and Medicine, NYU Langone Health, New York, NY, USA."

The following report summarizes a three-year study of 1320 law enforcement cases involving over 3000 products described as vegetable material, powders, capsules, tablets, blotter paper, or drug paraphernalia. All items were seized in Arkansas from January 2010 through December 2012 and submitted to the Arkansas State Crime Laboratory for analysis. The geographical distribution of these seizures co-localized in areas with higher population, colleges, and universities. Validated forensic testing procedures confirmed the presence of 26 synthetic cannabinoids, 12 designer stimulants, and 5 hallucinogenic-like drugs regulated by the Synthetic Drug Prevention Act of 2012 and other state statutes. Analysis of paraphernalia suggests that these drugs are commonly used concomitantly with other drugs of abuse including marijuana, MDMA, and methamphetamine. Exact designer drug compositions were unpredictable and often formulated with multiple agents, but overall, the synthetic cannabinoids were significantly more prevalent than all the other designer drugs detected.

Reducing the risk of medication errors in women.,"Matthew C Grissinger, Kate Kelly","We outline some of the causes of medication errors involving women and recommend ways that healthcare practitioners can prevent some of these errors. Patient safety has become a major concern since the November 1999 release of the Institute of Medicine (IOM) report, ""To Err Is Human."" Errors involving prescription medications are responsible for up to 7000 American deaths per year, and the financial costs of drug-related morbidity and mortality may be nearly $77 billion a year. The Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) collects and analyzes voluntary confidential medication error reports and makes recommendations on the prevention of such errors. This paper uses the expertise of ISMP in medication error prevention to make recommendations to prevent medication errors involving women. Healthcare practitioners should focus on areas of the medication use process that would have the greatest impact, including obtaining complete patient information, accurately communicating drug information, and properly educating patients. Although medication errors are not more common in women, there are some unique concerns with medications used for treating women. In addition, sharing of information about medication use and compliance with medication regimens have been identified as concerns.

Evaluation of the enantioselectivity of carbon nanoparticles-modified chiral separation systems using dextrin as chiral selector by capillary electrokinetic chromatography.,"Xiaoyi Hua, Yingxiang Du, Jiaquan Chen, Guangfu Xu, Tao Yu, Qi Zhang","Nanoparticles (NPs) can be used as pseudostationary phases (PSPs) in EKC, which is similar to the use of micelle additives as applied in MEKC. To date, the use of NPs to enhance enantiomeric separation by EKC with β-CD or its derivative as chiral selector has been reported only in two papers. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no prior effort to use NPs for achieving enantioseparation with polysaccharides as chiral selector. This paper describes for the first time the use of carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) as PSPs to modify chiral separation system employing dextrin as chiral selector for the enantioseparations of several basic drugs in capillary EKC. Three different types of CNPs, including carbogenic nanoparticles (NPs), carboxylated single-walled carbon nanotubes, and carboxylated multiwalled carbon nanotubes, were used as running buffer additives, respectively. The potential of the PSPs and the effects of dextrin concentration, buffer pH, and buffer concentration on the enantioseparations were evaluated. Four pairs of tested enantiomers were successfully resolved in less than 15 min with the resolution values in the range of 1.41-4.52 under optimized conditions.

High-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in the identification and determination of phase I and phase II drug metabolites.,"M Holcapek, L Kolárová, M Nobilis","Applications of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) techniques coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in the identification and determination of phase I and phase II drug metabolites are reviewed with an emphasis on recent papers published predominantly within the last 6 years (2002-2007) reporting the employment of atmospheric pressure ionization techniques as the most promising approach for a sensitive detection, positive identification and quantitation of metabolites in complex biological matrices. This review is devoted to in vitro and in vivo drug biotransformation in humans and animals. The first step preceding an HPLC-MS bioanalysis consists in the choice of suitable sample preparation procedures (biomatrix sampling, homogenization, internal standard addition, deproteination, centrifugation, extraction). The subsequent step is the right optimization of chromatographic conditions providing the required separation selectivity, analysis time and also good compatibility with the MS detection. This is usually not accessible without the employment of the parent drug and synthesized or isolated chemical standards of expected phase I and sometimes also phase II metabolites. The incorporation of additional detectors (photodiode-array UV, fluorescence, polarimetric and others) between the HPLC and MS instruments can result in valuable analytical information supplementing MS results. The relation among the structural changes caused by metabolic reactions and corresponding shifts in the retention behavior in reversed-phase systems is discussed as supporting information for identification of the metabolite. The first and basic step in the interpretation of mass spectra is always the molecular weight (MW) determination based on the presence of protonated molecules [M+H](+) and sometimes adducts with ammonium or alkali-metal ions, observed in the positive-ion full-scan mass spectra. The MW determination can be confirmed by the [M-H](-) ion for metabolites providing a signal in negative-ion mass spectra. MS/MS is a worthy tool for further structural characterization because of the occurrence of characteristic fragment ions, either MS( n ) analysis for studying the fragmentation patterns using trap-based analyzers or high mass accuracy measurements for elemental composition determination using time of flight based or Fourier transform mass analyzers. The correlation between typical functional groups found in phase I and phase II drug metabolites and corresponding neutral losses is generalized and illustrated for selected examples.

Degraders early developability assessment: face-to-face with molecular properties.,"Giuseppe Ermondi, Maura Vallaro, Giulia Caron","Pharmaceutical scientists have huge expectations from heterobifunctional small molecule degraders to treat diseases with an unmet medical need. However, degraders are large and flexible and pose significant challenges in terms of cellular uptake and bioavailability. An efficient property-based design is therefore required to discover new oral degrader medicines. Here, we show the non‑transferability to degraders of in silico tools routinely implemented in small molecule drug discovery programs; and provide ionization, lipophilicity, polarity and chameleonicity data for a series of seven degraders. We also reveal that permeability can be modeled by Δlog k<sub>W</sub><sup>IAM</sup> - an experimental polarity descriptor.

"Exploring paediatric oral suspension development: Challenges, requirements, and formulation advancements.","Sachin S Gaikwad, Javier O Morales, Narayan B Lande, Johanna Catalán-Figueroa, Umesh D Laddha, Sanjay J Kshirsagar","Oral suspension is the most preferred dosage form for the paediatric population because of the difficulties related to solid medications, such as the swallowing limitations, bitter taste, and poor oral bioavailability, which can cause serious impairment to attain a successful treatment. Given the importance of successful therapies, there is a need for safe and effective commercially-available paediatric oral suspension and their characterization. For the latter, it is important to identify safe excipients and preservatives. The paediatric group is a diverse category which includes infants and teenagers, with major pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics differences, mainly because of physiological and behavioral variations. Therefore, finding a single formulation for paediatric population remains a challenge, as well asthe formulation of stable-in-time suspension. In addition, drug's dissolving characteristic and permeation, are the main determinants for oral absorption, which are closely related to drug release kinetics from the pharmaceutical form. In this context, drug release profile is an important and limiting step in oral bioavailability, particularly for BCS class II drugs; thus, it is possible to increase bioavailability and minimize adverse effects by changing the release rate of such drugs. This review covers all the aspects for paediatric oral suspension development, and analyses the considerations for excipients selection as a crucial task for effectively choosing a safe and effective pharmaceutical form and correctly dosing paediatric patients.",2024,International journal of pharmaceutics,"Challenges, Drug selection Criteria, Excipient selection, Latest advancement, Paediatric oral suspension","Humans, Suspensions, Administration, Oral, Child, Excipients, Biological Availability, Drug Compounding, Adolescent, Drug Liberation, Chemistry, Pharmaceutical, Infant, Pharmaceutical Preparations",10.1016/j.ijpharm.2024.124169,"Department of Pharmaceutics, Sanjivani College of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, Savitribai Phule Pune University, At Sahajanandnagar, Post-Shinganapur, Tal-Kopargaon, Ahmednagar, Maharashtra 423603, India; Department of Pharmaceutics, MET's Institute of Pharmacy, Affiliated to Savitribai Phule Pune University, Bhujbal Knowledge City, Adgaon, Nashik 422003, India.

Release characteristics of anionic drug compounds from liquid crystalline gels I: Passive release across non-rate-limiting membranes.,"Dara Fitzpatrick, John Corish","Liquid crystalline gels (LCG) offer the formulator dynamic and flexible vehicles, into which actives, enhancers and other adjuvants with a wide range of physicochemical properties can be incorporated. This is achievable because of the biphasic oil/water composition of the gel. In this paper, the suitability of an isotropic liquid crystalline gel is investigated for a range of anionic drug molecules, with particular emphasis on sodium diclofenac. Parameters, which have been investigated, include the mode of vehicle preparation, the effect of the concentration of the drug and how buffering the gel and/or the receptor medium affect the release profiles. Such profiles have been measured for the sodium salts of benzoate, salicylate and indomethacin. The passive release from the standard system was found to adhere to matrix-controlled diffusion. An increase in concentration leads to a non-linear increase in the cumulative release of sodium diclofenac from the gels. In direct contrast to the result reported for cationic salbutamol base, optimum release from the gel was achieved when neither the receptor medium nor the aqueous phase of the gel was buffered. The percentages released of the sodium salts of benzoate, salicylate and indomethacin, after 24 h, were determined to be 25, 26 and 19%, respectively, and these are significantly greater than the release of sodium diclofenac. This suggests that diclofenac undergoes ion-pairing or complexation within the gel, which inhibits its diffusion from the vehicle. Future papers will report on the incorporation of enhancers and the effects of iontophoresis on the release profiles of drugs from these gels, and ultimately on the transdermal transport of drugs from these vehicles across human and porcine skin.",No date available,International journal of pharmaceutics,No keywords,"Agar, Algorithms, Anions, Bromides, Buffers, Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid, Crystallization, Diffusion, Drug Compounding, Gels, Iontophoresis, Membranes, Artificial, Models, Statistical, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Potassium Chloride, Potassium Compounds, Solutions",No DOI available,"School of Chemistry, Trinity College, University of Dublin, Dublin, Ireland."

The PRISMA protocol-based review of the most recent literature data from the last 10 years (2011-2021) was reported. Articles were searched by the combination of the following keywords: photobioreactor, pharmaceuticals, drugs, hormones, antibiotics, biodegradation, removal, wastewater treatment. The review focuses on original research papers (not reviews), collected in 3 scientific databases: Scopus, Web of Knowledge, PubMed. The review considered the following factors: type of microorganisms, type of micropollutants removed, degradation efficiency and associated products, types of photosynthetic organisms and photobioreactor types. The conclusion from the systematic review is that the main factors that limit widespread pharmaceuticals removal in photobioreactors are high costs and the problem of low efficiency related with low concentrations of pharmaceuticals. The review indicated a need for further research in this area due to increasing amounts of metabolites in the food chain, such as p-aminophenol and estrone, which can cause harm to people and ichthyofauna. Pharmaceuticals removal can be improved by adapting the type of microorganism used to the type of contamination and implementing photoperiods, which increase the removal efficiency of e.g. sulfamethazine by up to 28%.

Double-injection capillary electrophoresis for the identification of analytes.,Ahmad Amini,"This paper presents a new approach for identifying analytes by CE. The compound to be identified is analyzed together with the corresponding reference standard during a double injection capillary electrophoretic run. The inter-plug distance is regulated by applying an electrical field over the capillary for a predetermined time period (t(PE)). The migration time of an analyte being exposed to the partial electrophoresis was calculated from the partial migration time (t(mig(p))) as described in this paper. The identification is based on the closeness of agreement between the calculated migration time (t(mig(c))) and observed migration time (t(mig)) of the reference standard. The validity of the derived equations was checked by analyzing several substances such as caffeine, melamine, acetyl salicylic acid, paracetamol, ibuprofen, metoprolol, naproxen, somatropin, several insulin analogs, as well as different pharmaceutical and natural products.

"Hydrostability, mechanical resilience, and biodegradability of paper straws fabricated through lignin-based polyurethane and chitosan binary emulsion bonding.","Zhenghong Wu, Shaomin Kang, Yena Liu, Peipei Wang, Tian Liu, Rani Bushra, Mohammad Rizwan Khan, Jiaqi Guo, Wenyuan Zhu, Huining Xiao, Junlong Song","This study focuses on enhancing the strength and water stability of paper straws through a novel approach involving a binary emulsion of lignin-based polyurethane and chitosan. Kraft lignin serves as the raw material for synthesizing a blocked waterborne polyurethane, subsequently combined with carboxylated chitosan to form a stable binary emulsion. The resulting emulsion, exhibiting remarkable stability over at least 6 months, is applied to the base paper. Following emulsion application, the paper undergoes torrefaction at 155 °C. This process deblocks isocyanate groups, enabling their reaction with hydroxyl groups on chitosan and fibers, ultimately forming ester bonds. This reaction significantly improves the mechanical strength and hydrophobicity of paper straws. The composite paper straws demonstrate exceptional mechanical properties, including a tensile strength of 47.21 MPa, Young's modulus of 4.33 GPa, and flexural strength of 32.38 MPa. Notably, its water stability is greatly enhanced, with a wet tensile strength of 40.66 MPa, surpassing commercial paper straws by 8 folds.

Herein, an optimized paper-based surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) platform with patterned printing of plasmonic nanoparticles was constructed for the on-site quick testing of illegal drugs in urine. The filter paper was first coated with a layer of positive-charged chitosan, so as to reduce its roughness by filling the holes of the cellulose matrix and enhance the adhesion of negative-charged silver ink. Subsequently, hydrophobic modification was performed based on the binary silylation reaction, which could obviously improve the sensitivity of the paper-based SERS substrate by concentrating the amount of analyte. Meanwhile, SERS-active silver ink was fabricated and further printed on the surface of the above modified paper with custom-designed pattern (3 × 6). The performance of this SERS platform was assessed by using crystal violet (CV) as a model tag, and the obtained results proved it possesses excellent sensitivity and reproducibility, in which the relative standard deviation (RSD) dropped remarkably.

Priority must be given to solving two problems: firstly, a rough pre-purification is necessary to eliminate physiological components from the urine such as salts, urea, etc., and secondly, the mixture of metabolites has to be separated into single metabolites. Examples are given to demonstrate the practicability of these methods for the isolation and structural identification of metabolites belonging to varying structural classes.",No date available,Arzneimittel-Forschung,No keywords,"Biotransformation, Chromatography, Gas, Humans, Mass Spectrometry, Pharmaceutical Preparations",No DOI available,
Quantitative analysis of drugs in biological matrices by HPLC hyphenated to fluorescence detection.,"Emmanuelle Lipka, Claude Vaccher","An overview of the state-of-the art in HPLC coupled with fluorescence detection is presented. Over the last 20 years, the increasing number of methodological papers on this topic (4082 between 1994 and 2004 and 7725 between 2004 and 2014) is testament to its utility in bioanalytical applications. Compared with conventional UV absorbance detection used in HPLC, fluorescence detection can greatly enhance the sensitivity leading to limits of detection similar to those obtained with mass spectrometry, offering researchers a sensitive, robust and relatively inexpensive instrumental method.

"Computational models to predict aqueous drug solubility, permeability and intestinal absorption.",Christel A S Bergström,"In the last decade, poor intestinal absorption of candidate drugs intended for oral administration has been identified as a major bottleneck in drug development. Poor intestinal absorption can often be related to poor aqueous solubility and/or poor permeability across the intestinal wall. Other factors, such as poor stability and the metabolism of the compounds, can also decrease the amount of compound absorbed. In an effort to design compounds with enhanced absorption profile, theoretical predictions of solubility and permeability, among other factors, have gained increased interest, and a large number of papers have been published. In this review, the databases and techniques used for the development of in silico absorption models will be discussed. The focus is on aqueous drug solubility, which has become a major problem in drug development.",No date available,Expert opinion on drug metabolism & toxicology,No keywords,"Intestinal Absorption, Mathematics, Models, Theoretical, Permeability, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Solubility, Solutions",No DOI available,"Uppsala University, Center of Pharmaceutical Informatics, Department of Pharmacy, Biomedical Centre, PO Box 580, SE-751 23 Uppsala, Sweden."
Effect of grinding and heating on Ni2+ uptake properties of waste paper sludge.,"Vinay Kumar Jha, Yoshikazu Kameshima, Akira Nakajima, Kiyoshi Okada, Kenneth J D MacKenzie","Uptake properties of Ni2+ were examined for unmilled and milled paper sludge calcined at various temperatures to develop a new usage of waste paper sludge. Since paper sludge mainly consists of cellulose ([C6H(10)O5]n) fibers, calcite (CaCO3), kaolinite (Al2Si2O5(OH)4) and talc (Mg3Si(4)O(10)(OH)2), amorphous and crystalline CaO(MgO)-Al(2)O(3)-SiO(2) compounds are formed by calcining paper sludge. Wet and dry milling treatments were performed to accelerate solid-state reaction to form the above mentioned target compounds. The crystalline phases originally present decompose at increasing calcining temperature (up to 800 degrees C) in the order cellulose <kaolinite <calcite <talc. An amorphous phase was formed in the samples below 800 degrees C and the temperatures changed depending on the milling conditions in the order dry milled <wet milled <unmilled. Gehlenite (Ca(2)Al(2)SiO(7)) and anorthite (CaAl(2)Si(2)O(8)) crystallized by calcining at 900 degrees C in all the samples, formed by solid-state reaction of kaolinite with calcite. The (29)Si and (27)Al MAS NMR spectra of the amorphous samples were similar to those of crystalline phases, suggesting that the local structure of the amorphous phase resembles the crystalline structures. Maximum Ni2+ uptake occurred in the dry-milled samples calcined at 600 degrees C, and wet-milled and unmilled samples calcined at 700 degrees C, respectively. The dry-milled and calcined at 600 degrees C sample showed the highest Ni2+ uptake (4.54 mmol/g) and an uptake rate of 3.5 micromol/(gmin).",2006,Journal of environmental management,No keywords,"Adsorption, Cations, Divalent, Hot Temperature, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Kinetics, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Nickel, Paper, Sewage, Solutions, Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared, Waste Management, X-Ray Diffraction",No DOI available,"Department of Metallurgy and Ceramics Science, Tokyo Institute of Technology, O-okayama, Meguro, Tokyo, Japan."
Role of liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HR/MS) in clinical toxicology.,"Alan Hb Wu, Roy Gerona, Patil Armenian, Deborah French, Matthew Petrie, Kara L Lynch","Gas chromatography (GC) and liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) are widely used to confirm drug screening results and for urine screening in presumed intoxicated patients. These techniques are better suited to targeted analysis than to general unknown screening and, due to the complexity of testing, results are seldom available rapidly enough to contribute to the immediate care of the patient. High resolution (HR)/MS with time-of-flight (TOF) or orbitrap instruments offer potential advantages in clinical toxicology. COMPARISON OF GC-MS, LC-MS/MS AND LC-HR/MS: For unknown analyses, GC-MS and LC-MS/MS require comparison of full-scan spectra against preestablished libraries. Operation in full-scan mode greatly reduces sensitivity and some drugs present in low but significant concentrations may be missed. Selected ion monitoring (SIM) in GC/MS and selected reaction monitoring (SRM) in LC-MS/MS, where only targeted ions are monitored, increase sensitivity but require prior knowledge of what compound is to be measured. LC-HR/MS offers mass assignment with an accuracy of 0.001 atomic mass units (amu) compared with 1 amu in conventional MS. Tentative identification is thus directed to a very limited set of compounds (or even one unique compound) based on the exact molecular formula rather than a fragmentation pattern, since HR/MS can discriminate between compounds with the same nominal molecular mass. LC-MS/MS has clear advantages over GC/MS in ease and speed of sample preparation and the opportunities for its automation. LC-HR/MS is more suitable to clinical toxicology because the drugs present in a sample are rarely known a priori, and tentative identifications of unknowns can be made without the availability of a reference standard or a library spectrum.

Paper-based Electrochemical Sensor Integrated with Gold Nanoparticle-Decorated Carbon Cloth as a Working Electrode for Nitric Oxide Detection in Artificial Tears.,"Dulal Chandra Patra, Suvra Prakash Mondal","Nitric oxide (NO) in human tears regulates numerous ocular surface processes, such as tear generation, corneal wound healing, conjunctival vascular tone, and so forth. Any deviation from its normal concentration is linked to various ocular syndromes, including microbial keratitis, conjunctivitis, pterygium, dry eye, retinitis, glaucoma, and so forth. Therefore, precise monitoring of NO in tears can be considered as a potential biomarker for ocular diseases. Here, we report a highly sensitive and selective electrochemical NO sensor using carbon ink-based electrodes. Counter, working (WE), and reference electrodes have been designed and painted on a butter paper by using carbon ink. To improve the sensing performance, the WE has been modified with a gold nanoparticle (Au NP)-deposited carbon cloth (CC). Such a paper-based sensor demonstrated high sensitivity of ∼0.34 μA μM<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup>, ultralow detection limit of ∼2.35 nM, wide linear range of 10 nM-0.4 mM, and fast response time (0.35 s).

Mechanochemical Approaches to Pharmaceutical Cocrystal Formation and Stability Analysis.,Shan-Yang Lin,"Solid-state mechanochemical grinding is important for promoting cocrystal formation, particularly in the design of new solids in the pharmaceutical industry. Pharmaceutical cocrystals are defined as crystalline materials comprising an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and one or more appropriate coformers in a definite stoichiometric ratio, formed via non-covalent interactions. Recently, both the US FDA (2013) and the EU EMA (2015) provided a Guidance for Industry and a Reflection Paper, respectively, emphasizing that cocrystals are a new type of substance with potential applications in the pharmaceutical industry. This paper contains a brief and systematic overview of pharmaceutical cocrystals prepared by four grinding processes: neat grinding, solvent-assisted grinding, thermal stress after neat grinding, and polymer-assisted grinding. The paper also highlights some examples of pharmaceutical cocrystals prepared by the above grinding approaches, and discusses the stability of cocrystals prepared by mechanical grinding.

"Low-cost, high-speed identification of counterfeit antimalarial drugs on paper.","Myra T Koesdjojo, Yuanyuan Wu, Anukul Boonloed, Elizabeth M Dunfield, Vincent T Remcho","With the emergence of artesunate antimalarial counterfeiting in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, we present the production of a rapid, inexpensive and simple colorimetric-based testing kit for the detection of counterfeit artesunate in order to preserve life and prevent the development of multi-drug resistant malaria. The kit works based on paper microfluidics which offer several advantages over conventional microfluidics, and has great potential to generate inexpensive, easy-to-use, rapid and disposable diagnostic devices. Here, we have developed a colorimetric assay that is specific to artesunate and turns yellow upon addition of the sample. The test can be done within minutes, and allows for a semi-quantitative analysis of the artesunate tablets by comparing the developed yellow color on the paper test to a color-coded key chart that comes with the kit. A more accurate and precise analysis is done by utilizing a color analyzer on an iPhone camera that measures the color intensity of the developed color on the paper chip. A digital image of the chip was taken and analyzed by measuring the average gray intensity of the color developed on the paper circle. A plot of the artesunate concentration versus the average gray scale intensity was generated. Results show that the intensity of the yellow color developed on the paper test was consistent and proportional to the amount of artesunate present in the sample.

Paper-based SERS substrate and one-class classifier to monitor thiabendazole residual levels in extracts of mango peels.,"Carlos A Teixeira, Ronei J Poppi","The assessment of pesticide residue levels demands fast, low cost and easy-to-use procedures which are not found in conventional methods. In this work, SERS substrates based on the deposition of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) on common office paper were prepared using a wax printer. These substrates combined with Data Driven Soft Independent Modelling of Class Analogies (DD-SIMCA), a one-class classifier algorithm, were used for detection of pesticide residues in water extracts of mango peels. Paper-based substrates made sample collection easier compared with conventional SERS methods, since few microliters of the pesticide aqueous extract from fruit peels needed to be deposited onto the substrate. Moreover, one-class classifiers dismiss the need for quantification or calibration curves. Classification of a fruit with residue levels in accordance to regulatory bodies' limits is based on a mathematical threshold. Just as in an authentication problem, all the possibilities for a given analysed fruit are now restricted to agreeing or not agreeing with current regulations. The performance of the one-class model was demonstrated by detecting thiabendazole (TBZ) residues at various mango samples, with all results being confirmed by HPLC-DAD analysis.

From Lydia Pinkham to Bob Dole: what the changing face of direct-to-consumer drug advertising reveals about the professionalism of medicine.,Rosa Lynn Pinkus,"From its founding in 1847, the AMA divided drugs into ""ethical"" and ""unethical"" preparations. Those that were ethical had a known composition and were advertised only to the profession. Other, patent medicines (technically proprietary drugs, whose trademarks were protected by copyright), were sold directly to the public. In spite of the AMA's efforts to ban the advertising and sale of those nostrums, proprietary drugs flourished during the nineteenth century. Starting in 1900, however, three major societal trends combined to bolster the AMA's campaign, and by 1920 almost all advertising was directed to physicians, who would then prescribe medications to their patients. This ban on advertising pharmaceuticals directly to the public remained virtually unchanged until approximately 1980. Since then, it has slowly eroded and, as recently as 1997, the FDA created guidelines for pharmaceutical companies to advertise on television.

Overall impact of the regulatory requirements for genotoxic impurities on the drug development process.,"Antonio Giordani, Werner Kobel, Hans Ulrich Gally","In the last decade a considerable effort has been made both by the regulators and the pharmaceutical industry to assess genotoxic impurities (GTI) in pharmaceutical products. Though the control of impurities in drug substances and products is a well established and consolidated procedure, its extension to GTI has given rise to a number of problems, both in terms of setting the limits and detecting these impurities in pharmaceutical products. Several papers have dealt with this issue, discussing available regulations, providing strategies to evaluate the genotoxic potential of chemical substances, and trying to address the analytical challenge of detecting GTI at trace levels. In this review we would like to discuss the available regulations, the toxicological background for establishing limits, as well as the analytical approaches used for GTI assessment. The final aim is that of providing a complete overview of the topic with updated available information, to address the overall GTI issue during the development of new drug substances.",2011,European journal of pharmaceutical sciences : official journal of the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences,No keywords,"Animals, Chemistry, Pharmaceutical, DNA Damage, Drug Contamination, Drug Industry, Europe, Guidelines as Topic, Humans, International Cooperation, Mice, Mutagens, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Quality Control, Risk Assessment, Toxicity Tests, United States, United States Food and Drug Administration",10.1016/j.ejps.2011.03.004,"Rottapharm/Madaus, Monza, IT, Italy. antonio.giordani@rottapharm.com"
Kinetics of drug action in disease states: towards physiology-based pharmacodynamic (PBPD) models.,Meindert Danhof,"Gerhard Levy started his investigations on the ""Kinetics of Drug Action in Disease States"" in the fall of 1980. The objective of his research was to study inter-individual variation in pharmacodynamics. To this end, theoretical concepts and experimental approaches were introduced, which enabled assessment of the changes in pharmacodynamics per se, while excluding or accounting for the cofounding effects of concomitant changes in pharmacokinetics. These concepts were applied in several studies. The results, which were published in 45 papers in the years 1984-1994, showed considerable variation in pharmacodynamics. These initial studies on kinetics of drug action in disease states triggered further experimental research on the relations between pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Together with the concepts in Levy's earlier publications ""Kinetics of Pharmacologic Effects"" (Clin Pharmacol Ther 7(3): 362-372, 1966) and ""Kinetics of pharmacologic effects in man: the anticoagulant action of warfarin"" (Clin Pharmacol Ther 10(1): 22-35, 1969), they form a significant impulse to the development of physiology-based pharmacodynamic (PBPD) modeling as novel discipline in the pharmaceutical sciences. This paper reviews Levy's research on the ""Kinetics of Drug Action in Disease States"". Next it addresses the significance of his research for the evolution of PBPD modeling as a scientific discipline. PBPD models contain specific expressions to characterize in a strictly quantitative manner processes on the causal path between exposure (in terms of concentration at the target site) and the drug effect (in terms of the change in biological function). Pertinent processes on the causal path are: (1) target site distribution, (2) target binding and activation and (3) transduction and homeostatic feedback.",2015,Journal of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,"Biophase distribution, Disease systems analysis, Dynamical systems analysis, Receptor theory","Disease, Drug Therapy, Kinetics, Models, Biological, Models, Theoretical, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Pharmacokinetics",10.1007/s10928-015-9437-x,"Leiden Academic Centre for Drug Research, Leiden University, P.O.

Identification of drugs in physiological fluids following on-line liquid chromatographic purification and analysis.,"A K Adams, H Essien, S R Binder","This paper describes the application of an automated algorithm for drug identification following the liquid chromatographic on-line separation and purification of drugs in physiological fluids. Two hundred fifty-seven (257) drugs and 45 drug metabolites were assembled for testing. Two internal standards were used which monitored different columns in the multi-step analytical separation. Retention reproducibility over a nine month period was 4 p. cent or less for most drugs. The algorithm for matching unknown peaks against the stored library utilized relative retention, lambda maxima, normalized spectral overlays, wavelength ratios and zero-intercepts from the second derivative in a combined forward-reverse search. Most of the drugs which could not be unambiguously identified were sedatives which eluted in the first minutes of the chromatogram. Diasteromers were partially resolved. Repetitive analysis of 200-400 micrograms/l of amphetamine, diphenhydramine, imipramine and morphine were evaluated to establish an absorption cutoff of 12 mAbs, above which at least 95% of peaks were correctly identified. This corresponded to a signal-to-noise ratio of 12 for the scanning UV detector which was evaluated.",No date available,Annales de biologie clinique,No keywords,"Algorithms, Chromatography, Liquid, Humans, Medical Informatics Computing, Pharmaceutical Preparations",No DOI available,"Clinical HPLC Group, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA 94547."
Biliary excretion of drugs and other xenobiotics.,W G Levine,"A vast number and variety of xenobiotics appear in the bile. For some this is a final excretory process, for others it is merely one step in the active enterohepatic circulation. For still others it may be a vital step in a toxicologic or carcinogenic process. During the past ten years there has been a steady accumulation of observations in the literature bearing on biliary excretion mechanisms. Phenomena such as molecular weight thresholds and other aspects of species variation as well as response to inducing agents are described in many papers and much speculation is available as to their meaning. The clinical significance of this work is still somewhat dependent upon results obtained from lower animals, although studies occasionally appear on patients who have temporary bile drainage subsequent to surgery. It is important that efforts persist in obtaining data in humans since extrapolation from lower animals in the area of drug disposition is often precarious. The basic physiological and biochemical mechanism governing the biliary fate of drugs and other xenobiotics have yet to be elucidated fully.

Medicines counterfeiting is a complex problem: a review of key challenges across the supply chain.,Michael Tremblay,"The paper begins by asking why there is a market for counterfeit medicines, which in effect creates the problem of counterfeiting itself. Contributing factors include supply chain complexity and the lack of whole-systems thinking. These two underpin the author's view that counterfeiting is a complex (i.e. wicked) problem, and that corporate, public policy and regulatory actions need to be mindful of how their actions may be causal. The paper offers a problem-based review of key components of this complexity, viz., the knowledge end-users/consumers have of medicines; whether restrictive information policies may hamper information provision to patients; the internet's direct access to consumers; internet-enabled distribution of unsafe and counterfeit medicines; whether the internet is a parallel and competitive supply chain to legitimate routes; organised crime as an emerging medicines manufacturer and supplier and whether substandard medicines is really the bigger problem. Solutions respect the perceived complexity of the supply chain challenges. The paper identifies the need to avoid technologically-driven solutions, calling for 'technological agnosticism'. Both regulation and public policy need to reflect the dynamic nature of the problem and avoid creating perverse incentives; it may be, for instance, that medicines pricing and reimbursement policies, which affect consumer/patient access may act as market signals to counterfeiters, since this creates a cash market in cheaper drugs.",No date available,Current drug safety,No keywords,"Commerce, Counterfeit Drugs, Drug Costs, Drug and Narcotic Control, Humans, Internet, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Public Policy",No DOI available,"Tremblay Consulting, Cassis Ltd., Canterbury, Kent, UK. mike@tremblay-consulting.biz"
Near infrared spectroscopy for qualitative comparison of pharmaceutical batches.,"Y Roggo, C Roeseler, M Ulmschneider","Pharmaceuticals are produced according to current pharmacopoeias, which require quality parameters. Tablets of identical formulation, produced by different factories should have the same properties before and after storage. In this article, we analyzed samples having two different origins before and after storage (30 degrees C, 75% relative moisture). The aim of the study is to propose two approaches to understand the differences between origins and the storage effect by near infrared spectroscopy. In the first part, the main wavelengths are identified in transmittance and reflectance near infrared spectra in order to identify the major differences between the samples. In this paper, this approach is called fingerprinting. In the second part, principal component analysis (PCA) is computed to confirm the fingerprinting interpretation. The two interpretations show the differences between batches: physical aspect and moisture content. The manufacturing process is responsible for the physical differences between batches. During the storage, changes are due to the increase of moisture content and the decrease of the active content.",No date available,Journal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis,No keywords,"Pharmaceutical Preparations, Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared",No DOI available,"Bau 65, Raum 516, Hoffmann-La Roche, Grenzacherstrasse, 4070 Basel, Switzerland. yves.roggo@roche.com"

Parallel preparative high-performance liquid chromatography with on-line molecular mass characterization.,"Christine Edwards, Jianbo Liu, Thomas J Smith, Daniel Brooke, David J Hunter, Andrew Organ, Patrick Coffey","High-throughput chemistry (HTC) is now an integral part of the lead discovery process in many pharmaceutical and related chemical companies. As this process becomes refined or improved, with the integration of systems with enhanced capabilities, and the requirement for quality compounds of high purity increases, purification is often considered a bottleneck. Although a wide range of purification techniques is available, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is usually the preferred method of purification to produce high-purity compounds. Parallel preparative HPLC with robust UV-guided fraction collection has been shown to reduce the bottleneck and complement the parallel synthesis systems. However, despite the success of this technique, post-purification analysis of fractions to identify the target compound adds an additional level of complexity.

A sustainable carbon aerogel from waste paper with exceptional performance for antibiotics removal from water.,"Lina Ma, Daikun Li, Xing Chen, Hua Xu, Yu Tian","In this work, a sustainable 3D carbon aerogel (AO-WPC) is prepared from waste paper (WP), and used for efficient antibiotics removal from water. The AO-WPC aerogel shows good mechanical property and can recover after 100th of 30 % compression strain. The specific surface area of AO-WPC aerogel is up to 654.58 m<sup>2</sup>/g. More importantly, this aerogel reveals proper pore size distribution, including micro sized macropores between carbon fibers and intrinsic nano scale mesopores (11.86 nm), which is conducive to remove antibiotics from water. Taking tetracycline (Tc) as an example, the maximum adsorption capacity and adsorption rate of AO-WPC for Tc are as high as 384.6 mg/g and 0.510 g/(mg‧min), respectively, which exhibits significant advantages over most of the recent absorbents, and the adsorption toward Tc reveals good resistance to various environmental factors, including pH, various ions, and dissolved organic matter (DOM). Moreover, good thermal stability enables the AO-WPC aerogel to be regenerated through simple burning, and the adsorption capacity of Tc only decreases by 10.4 % after 10 cycles. Mechanism research shows that hydrogen bonding and π-π electron-donor-acceptor (EDA) interaction play the important role in the adsorption.

Paper-based nucleic acid amplification tests for point-of-care diagnostics.,"Navjot Kaur, Bhushan J Toley","There has been a recent resurgence in the use of paper as a substrate for developing point-of-care medical diagnostic tests, possibly triggered by expiring patents published in the 1990s. A hallmark of this resurgence has been the development of advanced shapes and structures made from paper to conduct multi-step fluidic operations using the wicking action of porous materials. Such devices indicate a distinct improvement over lateral flow immunoassays, which are restricted to conducting one-step operations. New developments in paper-based diagnostic devices have triggered interest in the development of paper-based point-of-care nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). NAATs can identify extremely low levels of specific nucleic acid sequences from clinical samples and are the most sensitive of all available tests for infectious disease diagnosis. Because traditional PCR-based NAATs require expensive instruments, the development of portable paper-based NAAT's has become an exciting field of research. This article aims to review and analyse the current state of development of paper-based NAATs. We project paper-based NAATs as miniaturized chemical processes and shed light on various schemes of operation used for converting the multiple steps of the chemical processes into paper microfluidic devices.

A review of GI conditions critical to oral drug absorption in malnourished children.,"Lisa Freerks, Eleni Papadatou Soulou, Hannah Batchelor, Sandra Klein",Accurate prediction of oral absorption of drugs relies on biorelevant methodology. Current methods are based on Western healthy adult populations. Malnourished children have many differences in their gastrointestinal anatomy and physiology compared to a healthy Western adult. These differences may affect the oral absorption of medicines and it is important to gather knowledge on these GI differences in order to develop biorelevant predictive methods for this vulnerable population. A literature search was conducted within PubMed and Scopus to identify papers that describe how gastrointestinal physiology and anatomy is altered in malnourished children. Relevant data was extracted and a narrative review generated to describe how GI differences may affect oral drug absorption. Several differences in GI anatomy and physiology were reported in the literature including: reduced saliva secretion; increased gastric pH; slower gastric emptying; increased levels of bacteria in the small intestine; reduced surface area of intestinal villi and increased intestinal permeability.

Effects of phosphate buffer in parenteral drugs on particle formation from glass vials.,"Toru Ogawa, Makoto Miyajima, Naoki Wakiyama, Katsuhide Terada","The characteristics of inorganic particles generated in glass vials filled with phosphate buffer solutions were investigated. During storage, particles were visually detected in the phosphate buffer solution in particular glass vials which pass compendial tests of containers for injectable drugs. These particles were considered to be different from ordinal glass delamination, which has been reported in a number of papers because the particles were mainly composed of Al, P and O, but not Si. The formation of the particles accelerated at higher storage temperatures. Among the surface treatments tested for the glass vials, sulfur treatment showed a protective effect on the particle formation in the vials, whereas the SiO(2) coating did not have any protective effects. It was found that the elution ratio of Al and Si in the solution stored in the glass vials after the heating was similar to the ratio of Al and Si in borosilicate glass. However, the Al concentration decreased during storage (5°C, 6 months), and consequently, particle formation was observed in the solution. Adding citrate, which is a chelating agent for Al, effectively suppressed the particle formation in the heated solution. When 50 ppb and higher concentrations of Al ion were added to the phosphate buffer solution, the formation of white particles containing Al, P and O was detected. It is suggested that a phosphate buffer solution in a borosilicate glass vial has the ability to form particles due to interactions with the Al that is eluted from the glass during storage.",2013,Chemical & pharmaceutical bulletin,No keywords,"Boron Compounds, Buffers, Glass, Infusions, Parenteral, Particle Size, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Phosphates, Silicates, Solutions, Surface Properties, Temperature",No DOI available,"Formulation Technology Research Laboratories, Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd., 1-12-1 Shinomiya, Hiratsuka, Kanagawa 254-0014, Japan. ogawa.toru.ir@daiichisankyo.co.jp"

Since then, two MCS papers have been published: the first proposing a structured approach to consider the impact of drug substance physical properties on manufacturability and the second outlining real world examples of MCS principles. By 2023, both publications had been extensively cited by over 240 publications. This article firstly reviews this citing work and considers how the MCS concepts have been received and are being applied. Secondly, we will extend the MCS framework to continuous manufacture. The review structure follows the flow of drug product development focussing first on optimisation of API properties. The exploitation of links between API particle properties and manufacturability using large datasets seems particularly promising. Subsequently, applications of the MCS for formulation design include a detailed look at the impact of percolation threshold, the role of excipients and how other classification systems can be of assistance. The final review section focusses on manufacturing process development, covering the impact of strain rate sensitivity and modelling applications.

In this study, we identified a distributed LSD analog from a paper-sheet product. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), liquid chromatography-photodiode array-mass spectrometry (LC-PDA-MS), and liquid chromatography with hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS) were used to analyze the sheet product. The sheet product claimed to contain 1-(1,2-dimethylcyclobutanoyl)-N,N-diethyllysergamide (1D-LSD). However, an unknown compound was detected in the product together with tryptamine and L-tryptophan methyl ester. This compound was isolated from the sheets and identified as 1-(thiophene-2-carbonyl)-N,N-diethyl-6-methyl-9,10-didehydroergoline-8β-carboxamide (1-thiophenoyl LSD; 1-(2-thienoyl)-LSD, 1T-LSD), using <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>13</sup>C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and various two-dimensional NMR techniques. 1T-LSD was shown to have the thiophene-2-carbonyl group at the N<sup>1</sup> position instead of the 1,2-dimethylcyclobutane-carbonyl group as claimed. The amount of 1T-LSD (free base) in three individual unit from one sheet was determined to be 87-100 μg per unit using a proton-specific quantitative NMR (<sup>1</sup>H-qNMR) method. Deacylation of 1T-LSD to LSD was also observed to occur in methanol-d<sub>4</sub> during NMR analysis.

Paper based analytical devices for blood grouping: a comprehensive review.,"Saeed Ebrahimi Fana, Maliheh Paknejad, Mahdi Aminian","The clinical importance of blood group (BG) antigens is related to their ability to induce immune antibodies that can cause hemolysis. Yet, ABO and D (Rh) are still considered to be the key antigens for healthy blood transfusion and secondary antigens are the next priority. Serological typing is the most widely used typing method. Rapid and accurate blood grouping plays an important role in some clinical conditions, rather than conventional techniques. Hence, developing a simple and economical model for rapid blood grouping would facilitate these tests. In recent decades, paper-based microfluidics such as μPADs has gained much interest in wide application areas such as point-of-care diagnostic. In this study, we evaluated μPADs that are performed for blood grouping and its recent progress. A comprehensive literature search was performed using databases including PUBMED, SCOPUS, Web of Science and Google Scholar. Keywords were blood grouping or typing, paper analytical device, rapid test, etc. After investigation of search results, 16 papers from 2010 to 2020 were included. Further information in detail was classified in Table 1. Generally, two principles for blood typing μPADs are introduced. The lateral chromatographic flow method and the vertical flow-through method that detects BG in a visual-based manner. To detect results with acceptable clarity many factors and challenges like paper, blood sample, buffer, Ab and RBC interaction and also μPADs stability need to be considered, which are discussed. In conclusion, the simplicity, stability, cheapness, portability and biocompatibility of μPADs for blood grouping confirming its utility and also they have the capability to robust, universal blood-grouping platform.

Rapid screening and multicomponent quantifications of active components of oral syrup over-the-counter medications by Raman and UV-visible spectroscopy and multivariate regression analysis.,"Sayo O Fakayode, Brinkley Bolton, Bailey Dassow, Kairy Galvez, Harmeet Chohan","Over-the-counter medications (OTCMs) are frequently recommended as a first-line treatment for common ailments, diseases, and illnesses. Oral liquid dosage forms are advantageous for rapid absorption with no dissolution time and are easier for pediatric and geriatric consumers to swallow. The production of these medicines by pharmaceutical industry makes them readily available to the public. Although the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) provides strict guidelines to drug manufacturers of these products; the risk of counterfeiting is a global issue. This can lead to several adverse effects and health issues. Here, we report a fast screening and quality assurance method using Raman and UV-visible spectroscopy combined with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Partial-Least-Square (PLS) regression of commonly used OTCM oral syrups. PLS regressions of UV-visible absorption spectra were used for multicomponent quantifications of the active component (acetaminophen, guaifenesin, dextromethorphan HBr, and phenylephrine HCl) concentrations of OTMCs in flavored (sugar or sugar-free) oral syrups. Raman and UV-visible spectral responses varied based on the type and concentration of the active component analyzed. PCA of the spectral data provided pattern recognition of the oral syrup OTCM. The developed PLS method demonstrated good linearity with an R<sup>2</sup> > 0.9784 and high sensitivity with a low detection limit of 0.02 mg/mL for acetaminophen and guaifenesin. Moreover, the simultaneous quantification of concentrations of all active components by the described method yielded good accuracies ranging from 88 to 94%. This study provides an example of the benefits of the combined use of Raman and UV-vis spectral profiling, PCA, and PLS regression for the quality analysis of oral syrups OTCM providing multicomponent quantification of active components with no need for sample extraction. The reported method can be easily adapted and scaled for online detection analysis used in the drug manufacturing industry, both in-situ and field analysis, and for the quality control of syrups OTCM by regulatory agencies and quality control officers.",2023,"Spectrochimica acta.

Research on prediction of human oral bioavailability of drugs based on improved deep forest.,"Lei Ma, Yukun Yan, Shaoxing Dai, Dangguo Shao, Sanli Yi, Jiawei Wang, Jingtao Li, Jiangkai Yan","Human oral bioavailability is a crucial factor in drug discovery. In recent years, researchers have constructed a variety of different prediction models. However, given the limited size of human oral bioavailability data sets, the challenge of making accurate predictions with small sample sizes has become a critical issue in the field. The deep forest model, with its adaptively determinable number of cascade levels, can perform exceptionally well even on small-scale data. However, the original deep forest suffers unbalanced multi-grained scanning process and premature stopping of cascade forest training. In this paper, we propose a human oral bioavailability predict method based on an improved deep forest, called balanced multi-grained scanning mapping cascade forest (bgmc-forest). Firstly, the mordred descriptor method is selected to feature extraction, then enhanced features are obtained by the improved balanced multi-grained scanning, which solves the problem of missing features at both ends. And finally, the prediction results are obtained by feature mapping cascaded forests, which is based on principal component analysis and cascade forests, ensures the effectiveness of the cascade forest. The superiority of the model constructed in this paper is demonstrated through comparative experiments, while the effectiveness of the improved module is verified through ablation experiments. Finally the decision-making process of the model is explained by the shapley additive explanations interpretation algorithm.",2024,Journal of molecular graphics & modelling,"Bioavailability, Deep forest, Molecular modeling","Humans, Biological Availability, Administration, Oral, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Algorithms, Deep Learning, Principal Component Analysis, Drug Discovery",10.1016/j.jmgm.2024.108851,"Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, CN 650500, China., Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, CN 650500, China., Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, CN 650500, China., Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, CN 650500, China.

Environmental and bioanalytical applications of hollow fiber membrane liquid-phase microextraction: a review.,"Jingyi Lee, Hian Kee Lee, Knut E Rasmussen, Stig Pedersen-Bjergaard","In hollow fiber membrane liquid-phase microextraction (LPME), target analytes are extracted from aqueous samples and into a supported liquid membrane (SLM) sustained in the pores in the wall of a small porous hollow fiber, and further into an acceptor phase present inside the lumen of the hollow fiber. The acceptor phase can be organic, providing a two-phase extraction system compatible with capillary gas chromatography, or the acceptor phase can be aqueous resulting in a three-phase system compatible with high-performance liquid chromatography or capillary electrophoresis. Due to high enrichment, efficient sample clean-up, and the low consumption of organic solvent, substantial interest has been devoted to LPME in recent years.

In situ gelling systems for ocular drug delivery.,"Bakr Ahmed, Srishty Jaiswal, Srishti Naryal, Rohan M Shah, Raid G Alany, Indu Pal Kaur","In situ gelling systems represent a burgeoning paradigm in ocular drug administration, addressing intrinsic challenges posed by extant ocular formulations, such as compromised bioavailability and constraints in traversing the corneal barrier. This systematic review endeavours to comprehensively examine the contemporary landscape of research in this domain, focusing on the nuanced capabilities of in situ gelling systems to optimize drug delivery and enhance therapeutic outcomes, without much technological complexity. Employing a meticulous search strategy across diverse databases for publications and patents spanning the years 2015 to 2023 a total of 26 research papers and 14 patents meeting stringent inclusion criteria were identified. Synthesizing the collective insights derived from these investigations, it becomes evident that in situ gelling systems confer an ability to protract the residence time of formulations or active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) within the ocular milieu. This sustained presence engenders extended drug release kinetics, thereby fostering improved patient compliance and mitigating the proclivity for side effects attendant to frequent dosing. These salutary effects extend to diminished systemic drug absorption, augmented ocular bioavailability, and the prospect of reduced dosing frequencies, thereby amplifying patient adherence to therapeutic regimens. Intriguingly, the protective attributes of in situ gelling systems extend to the establishment of an ocular surface barrier, thereby abating the susceptibility to infections and inflammatory responses. In summation, this review underscores the auspicious potential of in situ gelling systems as a transformative approach to advancing ocular drug delivery, warranting sustained research endeavours and developmental initiatives for the betterment of global patient outcomes.",2024,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,"Bioavailability, Ophthalmic, Patent, Polymer, Topical","Humans, Drug Delivery Systems, Administration, Ophthalmic, Gels, Animals, Biological Availability, Eye, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Ophthalmic Solutions",10.1016/j.jconrel.2024.05.031,"University Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Panjab University, Chandigarh, India., University Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Panjab University, Chandigarh, India., University Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Panjab University, Chandigarh, India., Department of Chemistry and Biotechnology, Swinburne University of Technology, Hawthorn, VIC 3122, Australia; School of Health and Biomedical Sciences, STEM College, RMIT University, Bundoora West, VIC 3038, Australia., Drug Discovery, Delivery and Patient Care (DDDPC) Theme, Department of Pharmacy, Kingston University London, Kingston upon Thames, UK; School of Pharmacy, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand., University Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Panjab University, Chandigarh, India.

Efficient method development strategy for challenging separation of pharmaceutical molecules using advanced chromatographic technologies.,"Kang Ping Xiao, Yuan Xiong, Fang Zhu Liu, Abu M Rustum","In this paper, we describe a strategy that can be used to efficiently develop a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation of challenging pharmaceutical molecules. This strategy involves use of advanced chromatographic technologies, such as a computer-assisted chromatographic method development tool (ChromSword) and an automated column switching system (LC Spiderling). This process significantly enhances the probability of achieving adequate separations and can be a large time saver for bench analytical scientists. In our study, the ChromSword was used for mobile phase screening and separation optimization, and the LC Spiderling was used to identify the most appropriate HPLC columns. For proof of concept, the analytes employed in this study are the structural epimers betamethylepoxide and alphamethylepoxide (also known as 16-beta methyl epoxide and 16-alpha methyl epoxide). Both of these compounds are used in the synthesis of various active pharmaceutical ingredients that are part of the steroid pharmaceutical products. While these molecules are relatively large in size and contain various polar functional groups and non-polar cyclic carbon chains, their structures differ only in the orientation of one methyl group. To our knowledge, there is no reported HPLC separation of these two molecules. A simple gradient method was quickly developed on a 5 cm YMC Hydrosphere C(18) column that separated betamethylepoxide and alphamethylepoxide in 10 min with a resolution factor of 3.0. This high resolution provided a true baseline separation even when the concentration ratio between these two epimers was 10,000:1. Although outside of the scope of this paper, stability-indicating assay and impurity profile methods for betamethylepoxide and for alphamethylepoxide have also been developed by our group based on a similar method development strategy.",2007,Journal of chromatography.

Effect of diabetes mellitus on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of drugs.,"Miroslav Dostalek, Fatemeh Akhlaghi, Martina Puzanovova","The effects of diabetes mellitus on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs have been well described in experimental animal models; however, only minimal data exist for humans and the current knowledge regarding the effects of diabetes on these properties remains unclear. Nevertheless, it has been observed that the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs are changed in subjects with diabetes. It has been reported that diabetes may affect the pharmacokinetics of various drugs by affecting (i) absorption, due to changes in subcutaneous adipose blood flow, muscle blood flow and gastric emptying; (ii) distribution, due to non-enzymatic glycation of albumin; (iii) biotransformation, due to regulation of enzymes/transporters involved in drug biotransformation; and (iv) excretion, due to nephropathy. Previously published data also suggest that diabetes-mediated changes in the pharmacokinetics of a particular drug cannot be translated to others. Although clinical studies exploring the effect of diabetes on pharmacodynamics are still very limited, there is evidence that disease-mediated effects are not limited only to pharmacokinetics but also alter pharmacodynamics. However, for many drugs it remains unclear whether these influences reflect diabetes-mediated changes in pharmacokinetics rather than pharmacodynamics. In addition, even though diabetes-mediated pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics might be anticipated, it is important to study the effect on each drug and not generalize from observed data. The available data indicate that there is a significant variability in drug response in diabetic subjects. The discrepancies between individual clinical studies as well as between ex vivo and clinical studies are probably due to (i) the restricted and focused population of subjects in clinical studies; (ii) failure to consider type, severity and duration of the disease; (iii) histopathological characteristics generally being missing; and (iv) other factors such as varying medication use, dietary protein intake, age, sex and obesity. The obesity epidemic in the developed world has also inadvertently influenced the directions of pharmacological research. This review attempts to map new information gained since Gwilt published his paper in Clinical Pharmacokinetics in 1991. Although a large body of research has been conducted and significant progress has been made, we still have to conclude that the available information regarding the effect of diabetes on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics remains unclear and further clinical studies are required before we can understand the clinical significance of the effect. An understanding of diabetes-mediated changes as well as of the source of the variability should lead to the improvement of the medical management and clinical outcomes in patients with this widespread disease.",No date available,Clinical pharmacokinetics,No keywords,"Animals, Clinical Trials as Topic, Diabetes Mellitus, Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental, Humans, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacology",10.2165/11631900-000000000-00000,"Department of Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Rhode Island, Kingston, RI, USA."
High-capacity conductive nanocellulose paper sheets for electrochemically controlled extraction of DNA oligomers.,"Aamir Razaq, Gustav Nyström, Maria Strømme, Albert Mihranyan, Leif Nyholm","Highly porous polypyrrole (PPy)-nanocellulose paper sheets have been evaluated as inexpensive and disposable electrochemically controlled three-dimensional solid phase extraction materials. The composites, which had a total anion exchange capacity of about 1.1 mol kg(-1), were used for extraction and subsequent release of negatively charged fluorophore tagged DNA oligomers via galvanostatic oxidation and reduction of a 30-50 nm conformal PPy layer on the cellulose substrate. The ion exchange capacity, which was, at least, two orders of magnitude higher than those previously reached in electrochemically controlled extraction, originated from the high surface area (i.e. 80 m(2) g(-1)) of the porous composites and the thin PPy layer which ensured excellent access to the ion exchange material. This enabled the extractions to be carried out faster and with better control of the PPy charge than with previously employed approaches. Experiments in equimolar mixtures of (dT)(6), (dT)(20), and (dT)(40) DNA oligomers showed that all oligomers could be extracted, and that the smallest oligomer was preferentially released with an efficiency of up to 40% during the reduction of the PPy layer. These results indicate that the present material is very promising for the development of inexpensive and efficient electrochemically controlled ion-exchange membranes for batch-wise extraction of biomolecules.",2011,PloS one,No keywords,"Buffers, Cellulose, DNA, Electric Conductivity, Electrochemical Techniques, Electrodes, Nanostructures, Oligonucleotides, Paper, Polymers, Pyrroles, Solutions, Spectrometry, Fluorescence, Time Factors",e29243,"The Ångström Laboratory, Department of Engineering Sciences, Nanotechnology and Functional Materials, Uppsala, Sweden."

Identification of an unknown extraneous contaminant in pharmaceutical product analysis.,"Mingxiang Lin, Min Li, Abu Rustum","During the content uniformity test of a drug product (tablet formulation), an unknown peak was observed in the HPLC chromatograms. Upon further investigation, it was determined that the unknown peak was originated from an external source and, therefore, the drug product is free of this unknown peak. The next step was to identify the structure of this unknown peak in order to determine the source of this contaminant species. In this paper, we wish to present the strategy and the results of the experiments that led to the identification of this unknown peak. LC-PDA/UV and LC-MS(n) analyses were conducted to obtain the UV spectrum, molecular weight and MS(n) fragmentation pathways of the unknown peak. The MS analysis revealed certain structural features of the unknown species and a number of model compounds that contain such features were then examined for their UV absorbance profiles in an attempt to establish the functional group connectivity within the unknown species. A careful examination of these results in conjunction with the determination of the high-resolution molecular weight led to a short list of potential candidates for the unknown species, among which the most likely one was 1,3-diphenylguanidine. The identification of the unknown contaminant was confirmed by spiking experiments using the authentic compound. The potential source of this contaminant was also identified as derived from the safety filler of the pipette bulb used to prepare the sample solutions during the drug analysis.",2007,Journal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis,No keywords,"Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid, Drug Contamination, Guanidines, Mass Spectrometry, Molecular Structure, Molecular Weight, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet, Tablets",No DOI available,"Global Quality Services-Analytical Sciences, Schering-Plough Corporation, 1011 Morris Avenue, Union, NJ 07083, United States."

Toward practical application of paper-based microfluidics for medical diagnostics: state-of-the-art and challenges.,"Kentaro Yamada, Hiroyuki Shibata, Koji Suzuki, Daniel Citterio","Microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (μPADs) have emerged as a promising diagnostic platform a decade ago. In contrast to highly active academic developments, their entry into real-life applications is still very limited. This discrepancy is attributed to the gap between research developments and their practical utility, particularly in the aspects of operational simplicity, long-term stability of devices, and associated equipment. On the basis of these backgrounds, this review attempts to: 1) identify the reasons for success of paper-based devices already in the market, 2) describe the current status and remaining issues of μPADs in terms of operational complexity, signal interpretation approaches, and storage stability, and 3) discuss the possibility of mass production based on established manufacturing technologies.

Enantioselective analytical methods in pharmacokinetics with specific reference to genetic polymorphic metabolism.,"Antonio Marzo, Erich Heftmann","The new trend towards developing enantiospecific drugs has increased the interest in enantiospecific pharmacokinetics of chiral drugs, mainly in the case where only one of the two enantiomers is responsible for the pharmacological activity. Enantiospecific bioassays are also useful in investigating the pharmacokinetic behaviour of the two enantiomers when a given drug is marketed as racemate. The stability of the stereogenic centre in vitro and in vivo, as far as unidirectional and bidirectional inversions are concerned, is another reason for requiring stereospecific assay and bioassay. These assays are often complicated in order to achieve quantification, mainly for in vivo measurements, which are often in the low pg/ml range.

A review on protein functionalized carbon nanotubes.,"Kathyayini Nagaraju, Roopa Reddy, Narendra Reddy","Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been widely recognized and used for controlled drug delivery and in various other fields due to their unique properties and distinct advantages. Both single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and multiwalled (MWCNTs) carbon nanotubes are used and/or studied for potential applications in medical, energy, textile, composite, and other areas. Since CNTs are chemically inert and are insoluble in water or other organic solvents, they are functionalized or modified to carry payloads or interact with biological molecules. CNTs have been preferably functionalized with proteins because CNTs are predominantly used for medical applications such as delivery of drugs, DNA and genes, and also for biosensing. Extensive studies have been conducted to understand the interactions, cytotoxicity, and potential applications of protein functionalized CNTs but contradicting results have been published on the cytotoxicity of the functionalized CNTs.

"Growth hormone, enhancement and the pharmaceuticalisation of short stature.",Michael Morrison,"This paper takes the biological drug human Growth Hormone (hGH) as a case study to investigate processes of pharmaceuticalisation and medicalisation in configuring childhood short stature as a site for pharmaceutical intervention. Human growth hormone is considered to have legitimate applications in treating childhood growth hormone deficiency and short stature associated with other recognised conditions. It is also regarded by bioethicists and others as a form of human biomedical enhancement when applied to children with idiopathic or 'normal' short stature. The purpose of this study is not to evaluate whether treatment of idiopathic short stature is enhancement or not, but to evaluate how some applications of hGH in treating short stature have come to be accepted and stabilised as legitimate 'therapies' while others remain contested as 'enhancements'. A comparative, historical approach is employed, drawing on approaches from medical sociology and Science and Technology Studies (STS) to set out a socio-technical history of hGH in the US and UK. Through this history the relative influence and interplay of drivers of pharmaceuticalisation, including industry marketing and networks of drug distribution, and processes of medicalisation will be employed to address this question and simultaneously query the value of enhancement as a sociological concept.",2014,Social science & medicine (1982),"Growth hormone, History, Human enhancement, Medicalisation, Pharmaceuticalisation, STS, UK, USA","Biomedical Enhancement, Body Height, Dwarfism, Pituitary, Growth Disorders, Human Growth Hormone, Humans, Medicalization, Prescription Drug Overuse, Quality of Life, United Kingdom, United States",10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.10.015,"Centre for Health, Law & Emerging Technologies (HeLEX), Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Room 120, Rosemary Rue Building, Old Road Campus, Headington, OX3 7LF Oxford, Oxon, UK.

The population approach to pharmacokinetic data analysis: rationale and standard data analysis methods.,L B Sheiner,"Population pharmacokinetics describe the typical relationships between physiology (both normal and disease altered) and pharmacokinetics, the interindividual variability in these relationships, and their residual intraindividual variability. Knowledge of population kinetics can help one to choose initial drug dosage, to modify dosage appropriately in response to observed drug levels, to make rational decisions regarding certain aspects of drug regulation, and to investigate and elucidate certain research questions in pharmacokinetics. Experimental data from which population kinetics might be estimated often come from only those few individuals both willing and available to be studied. Clinical data from patients undergoing care might be more representative. These data, however, are marked by varying quality, accuracy, and precision, as well as there being few data per patient. Population pharmacokinetic parameters have traditionally been estimated either by fitting all individuals' data together as though there were no individual kinetic differences [the naive pooled data (NPD) approach], or by fitting each individual's data separately and then combining the individual parameter estimates [the two-stage (TS) approach]. These methods have certain theoretical problems which can only be aggravated when the deficiencies of data typical of clinical data are present. In this paper, the standard approaches are discussed and illustrated (using nondeficient data) in order to introduce subsequent papers in which alternative data analysis methods for population parameter estimation are defined, discussed, and compared.",No date available,Drug metabolism reviews,No keywords,"Humans, Ketoprofen, Kinetics, Models, Biological, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Population",No DOI available,

In group 2, after chemomechanical preparation, the root canals were dressed with 2 microliter of 40% CMCP. The medicament was replaced on days 3 and 7. In group 3, root canals were treated in a manner similar to those in group 2, except that the medicament was renewed on days 1 and 7. The loss of CMCP was determined in groups 2 and 3. The results showed that chemomechanical preparation could reduce bacteria in root canals to an uncultivable number. Approximately 62.5% of the original concentration of CMCP was lost after placement in root canals for 1 day. Intracanal dressing with CMCP between appointments induced a rapid decrease in number of bacteria in root canals within the first 1 to 3 days.

Application of micellar electrokinetic chromatography to pharmaceutical analysis.,"H Nishi, S Terabe","Electrokinetic chromatography is a new type of analytical separation method which belongs to the group of high performance capillary electrophoretic techniques but whose separation principle is based on that of chromatography. The solute distributes itself between a carrier and the surrounding medium. The carrier, which corresponds to the stationary phase in conventional chromatography, can be transported by electrophoresis with a different velocity from the surrounding medium. The separation is achieved by the differential solute distribution and the differential migration of the carrier. The charged molecules or charged molecular aggregates are employed as the carrier. Various kinds of carriers are available for electrokinetic chromatography along with different partition mechanisms. Among them, micellar electrokinetic chromatography, which employs an ionic micelle as a carrier, has become the most popular method because of its unique and attractive characteristics as well as the separating capability of electrically neutral or nonionic solutes in comparison with capillary zone electrophoresis.

Highlights of marine natural products chemistry (1972-1999).,D J Faulkner,"Marine Natural Products Chemistry is essentially a child of the 1970's that developed rapidly during the 1980's and matured in the last decade. With a few notable exceptions, it is difficult to select individual papers that significantly impacted the field. However, marine natural products chemistry has often influenced other fields and that aspect is the focus of this review. It is clear that the early directions taken by marine natural products chemists drew as much from the examples provided by insect chemical ecology as from the longer history of phytochemistry. By 1975 there were already three parallel tracks in marine natural products chemistry: marine toxins, marine biomedicinals and marine chemical ecology. It is the integration of the three fields of study that has given marine natural products chemistry its unique character and vigour.",No date available,Natural product reports,No keywords,"Marine Biology, Molecular Structure, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Toxins, Biological",No DOI available,"Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla 92093-0212, USA."
Establishing conditions for the storage and elution of rabies virus RNA using FTA(®) cards.,"Takeo Sakai, Ayako Ishii, Takao Segawa, Yukihiko Takagi, Yuki Kobayashi, Takuya Itou","The Flinders Technology Associates filter paper cards (FTA(®) cards) can be used to store nucleic acid from various samples and are easily portable. However, RNA is physicochemically unstable compared with DNA, and appropriate methods have not been established for storage and extraction of RNA from FTA(®) cards. The present study investigated the optimum conditions for storage and elution of viral RNA (vRNA) using rabies virus (RABV) applied to FTA(®) cards. When TE buffer was used, the elution rates of vRNA increased with the length of the elution time. When the cards were stored at -80 °C or -20 °C, vRNA was stable over 3 months. Degradation of vRNAs occurred following storage at 4 °C and room temperature, suggesting that RNA should be extracted from cards as soon as possible if no freezer is available. When we tried to amplify vRNA from RABV-infected animal brains applied to FTA(®) cards and stored at -80 °C for 6 months, we did not detect any amplified products with the primer set for 964 bp of RABV N gene. However, we were able to detect amplified products by increasing the elution time of vRNA from FTA(®) cards from 30 min to 24 hr or by changing the primer sets to amplify 290 bp of N gene. Thus, we recommend extending the elution time for damaged or low concentration samples in FTA(®) cards.",2014,The Journal of veterinary medical science,No keywords,"Animals, Brain, Emulsions, Mice, Paper, RNA, Viral, Rabies virus, Specimen Handling, Temperature",10.1292/jvms.14-0227,"Nihon University Veterinary Research Center, 1866 Kameino, Fujisawa, Kanagawa 252-0880, Japan."
DIVSEL and COMPLIB--strategies for the design and comparison of combinatorial libraries using pharmacophoric descriptors.,"S D Pickett, C Luttmann, V Guerin, A Laoui, E James",Screening synthetic combinatorial libraries may facilitate rapid drug lead discovery by substantially increasing the number of molecules tested. Drug discovery efficiency and productivity can be further improved by designing libraries to maximize their molecular diversity or by comparing them to existing collections of compounds and/or libraries to select those that complement the properties already well represented. In this paper we describe two strategies to aid in the design and comparison of combinatorial libraries. The methods employ multi-pharmacophore three-dimensional (3D) descriptors in combination with two recent proposals for dissimilarity-based compound selection and library comparison. This method allows the design to be performed in product space and library comparison to consider all pair-wise intermolecular contributions to the diversity.,No date available,Journal of chemical information and computer sciences,No keywords,"Drug Design, Indicators and Reagents, Methods, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Software",No DOI available,"Rhône-Poulenc Rorer S.

Navigating the complexities of medicating paediatric patients: Insights from an enteral feeding tube workshop.,"Jennifer Walsh, Esmerald Hermans, Smita Salunke","Enteral feeding tubes (EFT) are used to administer nutrition into the gastrointestinal tract of patients who are unable to take nutrition via mouth. A wide range of children may require enteral feeding through EFT which are also used to administer medication. However, many medicines are not licensed for administration via this route. Numerous factors can impact EFT medicine administration, including for example, dosage form properties and composition, EFT size, design and material, and operational aspects such as tube flushing. As a result, the risk of sub-optimal dosing and medication error is much higher in patients with EFT compared to those without. EuPFI organised a preconference workshop to review the current state of knowledge around aspects to be considered in the verification of EFT administration of medications to children, and considerations for EFT use, and to highlight the areas that remain challenging. Healthcare professional, pharmaceutical industry and regulatory agency perspectives were shared, and case studies discussed.

Use of microwave in processing of drug delivery systems.,T W Wong,"Microwave has received a widespread application in pharmaceuticals and food processing, microbial sterilization, biomedical therapy, scientific and biomedical analysis, as well as, drug synthesis. This paper reviews the basis of application of microwave to prepare pharmaceutical dosage forms such as agglomerates, gel beads, microspheres, nanomatrix, solid dispersion, tablets and film coat. The microwave could induce drying, polymeric crosslinkages as well as drug-polymer interaction, and modify the structure of drug crystallites via its effects of heating and/or electromagnetic field on the dosage forms. The use of microwave opens a new approach to control the physicochemical properties and drug delivery profiles of pharmaceutical dosage forms without the need for excessive heat, lengthy process or toxic reactants. Alternatively, the microwave can be utilized to process excipients prior to their use in the formulation of drug delivery systems.

Non-invasive identification of incoming raw pharmaceutical materials using Spatially Offset Raman Spectroscopy.,"Matthew Bloomfield, Darren Andrews, Paul Loeffen, Craig Tombling, Tim York, Pavel Matousek","A new approach to verification of incoming raw materials through packaging in pharmaceutical manufacturing is proposed and demonstrated. The method is based around Spatially Offset Raman Spectroscopy (SORS) and permits a rapid chemical identity analysis of incoming materials to satisfy regulatory requirements but without the need to open the packaging. This dramatically increases the throughput of incoming raw materials into the pharmaceutical manufacturing chain and eliminates the need for a chemically safe sampling environment required for invasive inspection methods. Since the inspection is non-invasive the safety of the operators is ensured and the integrity of inspected material is not compromised by preventing exposure to the ambient atmosphere and cross contamination. The experiments presented here demonstrate the ability to accurately identify common pharmaceutical materials, typically in under 10s acquisition time, through a range of frequently used packaging, including translucent plastic and paper sacks and coloured glass bottles, which can be challenging for conventional Raman spectroscopy as well as other optical spectroscopy methods. With the exception of metallic containers and cardboard drums all the tested packaging materials proved to be amenable to this technique.

Rapid segmentation and sensitive analysis of CRP with paper-based microfluidic device using machine learning.,"Qihong Ning, Wei Zheng, Hao Xu, Armando Zhu, Tangan Li, Yuemeng Cheng, Shaoqing Feng, Li Wang, Daxiang Cui, Kan Wang","Microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (μPADs) have been widely used in point-of-care testing owing to their simple operation, low volume of the sample required, and the lack of the need for an external force. To obtain accurate semi-quantitative or quantitative results, μPADs need to respond to the challenges posed by differences in reaction conditions. In this paper, multi-layer μPADs are fabricated by the imprinting method for the colorimetric detection of C-reactive protein (CRP). Different lighting conditions and shooting angles of scenes are simulated in image acquisition, and the detection-related performance of μPADs is improved by using a machine learning algorithm. The You Only Look Once (YOLO) model is used to identify the areas of reaction in μPADs. This model can observe an image only once to predict the objects present in it and their locations. The YOLO model trained in this study was able to identify all the reaction areas quickly without incurring any error. These reaction areas were categorized by classification algorithms to determine the risk level of CRP concentration. Multi-layer perceptron, convolutional neural network, and residual network algorithms were used for the classification tasks, where the latter yielded the highest accuracy of 96%.

Chemical Penetration Enhancers for Transdermal Drug Delivery - Success and Challenges.,Kevin B Ita,"Chemical penetration enhancers (CPEs), which are also referred to as sorption promoters or accelerants have several advantages in transdermal drug delivery. These are painlessness, noninvasiveness and the capacity to increase in transdermal flux in comparison with passive diffusion. Several investigators have used a number of chemical enhancers to demonstrate these important properties. Studies have also been carried out to have a better understanding of the mechanisms of penetration enhancement. It has been postulated that these compounds can enhance transdermal drug delivery by perturbing the stratum corneum, increasing partition coefficient or increasing solubility. In this paper, several compounds used in facilitating percutaneous penetration of drugs have been described and the potential of using them for transdermal drug delivery highlighted. Special attention has been paid to cell-penetrating proteins (protein transduction domains) as well as skin penetrating peptides.

However, the residence concept as presented in most papers is supported by rather misleading simulations and arguments, and by examples where compounds are taken out of their pharmacokinetic context. Moreover, fast association is typically more desirable than slow, and advantages of long residence time, notably a potential disconnect between pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacokinetics (PK), would be partially or completely offset by slow on-rate. Therefore, plain potency is likely a better predictor of drug development success than is residence time.",2017,Drug discovery today,No keywords,"Animals, Drug Discovery, Kinetics, Ligands, Models, Biological, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Pharmacokinetics",10.1016/j.drudis.2017.07.016,"Discovery Sciences, Innovative Medicines and Early Development Biotech Unit, AstraZeneca, Pepparedsleden 1, Mölndal, 431 83, Sweden.

Evaluation of monolithic and sub 2 microm particle packed columns for the rapid screening for illicit drugs--application to the determination of drug contamination on Irish euro banknotes.,"Jonathan Bones, Mirek Macka, Brett Paull","A study comparing recently available 100 x 3 mm id, 200 x 3 mm id monolithic reversed-phase columns with a 50 x 2.1 mm id, 1.8 microm particle packed reversed-phase columns was carried out to determine the most efficient approach (using traditional van Deemter analysis and a modern kinetic plot approach) for the rapid screening of samples for 16 illicit drugs and associated metabolites. A plot of column backpressure versus plate number (N) showed a significant advantage of using the monolithic phases, with the 20 cm monolithic column exhibiting a maximum 15,000 plates at a column backpressure of approximately 70 bar, compared to approximately 7000 plates at 150 bar for the 5 cm 1.8 microm particle packed column. Optimum linear velocities were found to be 0.40 mm s(-1), 0.52 mm s(-1) and 0.98 mm s(-1) for the three above columns, respectively. The 20 cm monolithic column was subsequently applied to the separation and determination of illicit drug contamination on Irish euro banknotes, using methanol extraction followed by LC-MS/MS. Method performance data showed that the new LC-MS/MS method was significantly more sensitive than previous GC-MS/MS based methods for this application, with detection limits in the pg note(-1) region, based upon a 20 microL standard injection.

Improving properties of Hanji by coating chitosan-silver nanoparticle solution.,"Jeyoung Jung, Gownolla Malegowd Raghavendra, Dowan Kim, Jongchul Seo","A chitosan-silver nanoparticle solution (CSNS) was applied as a coating material to Hanji (Korean traditional paper), and the properties of the coated paper were investigated as a function of the dilution ratio. The required CSNS was first prepared from AgNO<sub>3</sub> (30mmol) by utilizing chitosan as a reducing and stabilizing agent via ultrasonication. The as-prepared CSNS was diluted to various ratios (undiluted, 1/10, 1/100, and 1/1000) and applied to Hanji by a dip-coating method. The tensile, burst, oil resistance, and antibacterial properties of the coated Hanji against Escherichia coli were evaluated. Among the various dilution ratios, the maximum level of dilution that can positively influence the tensile, burst, oil resistance, and antibacterial properties of Hanji was identified as 1/10, 1/100, 1/10 and 1/1000 of the pure CSNS, respectively.

Alternative and generalized approach to in vitro-in vivo correlation.,"Zuzana Vitková, Anton Vitko, Marián Zabka, Jozef Cizmárik","Evaluation of in vitro-in vivo correlation (IVIVC) plays important role in securing therapeutic effect if a dosage form undergoes technological modifications. Similarity (closeness) of dissolution profiles of the original and modified dosage forms has been traditionally considered to be sufficient for similar in vivo responses. This may be true if the IVIVC model (dependence between the dissolution and corresponding absorption profiles) is given by a linear straight line with the unit slope. The paper presents an alternative and generalized approach to IVIVC evaluation. Influences of pre-systemic processes (disintegration, dissolution, absorption) on the system response (concentration time profile C(t), bioavailability BD and other) are analyzed and evaluated. Both the magnitude and sign of IVIVC are then derived from the magnitudes and signs of these influences. The underlining idea is that pre-systemic processes do not correlate with the system response, (e.g., plasmatic concentration) if small modifications of the former do not induce significant changes of the later. If this is so, the therapeutic effects of the modified and original dosage forms may be considered equal or at least similar. In this way the problem of IVIVC is not only exactly mathematically founded but modifications of pre-systemic processes are directly projected to the system output-- the time profile of plasmatic concentration. Moreover, the approach is applicable to virtually any dosage form. Its feasibility was validated in vivo.",No date available,Acta poloniae pharmaceutica,No keywords,"Animals, Chemistry, Pharmaceutical, Dosage Forms, Drug Administration Routes, Drug Compounding, Humans, Models, Chemical, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Pharmacokinetics, Solubility, Technology, Pharmaceutical, Therapeutic Equivalency",No DOI available,"Comenius University, Faculty of Pharmacy, Bratislava, Slovakia."

The read-across hypothesis and environmental risk assessment of pharmaceuticals.,"Mariann Rand-Weaver, Luigi Margiotta-Casaluci, Alpa Patel, Grace H Panter, Stewart F Owen, John P Sumpter","Pharmaceuticals in the environment have received increased attention over the past decade, as they are ubiquitous in rivers and waterways. Concentrations are in sub-ng to low μg/L, well below acute toxic levels, but there are uncertainties regarding the effects of chronic exposures and there is a need to prioritise which pharmaceuticals may be of concern. The read-across hypothesis stipulates that a drug will have an effect in non-target organisms only if the molecular targets such as receptors and enzymes have been conserved, resulting in a (specific) pharmacological effect only if plasma concentrations are similar to human therapeutic concentrations. If this holds true for different classes of pharmaceuticals, it should be possible to predict the potential environmental impact from information obtained during the drug development process. This paper critically reviews the evidence for read-across, and finds that few studies include plasma concentrations and mode of action based effects. Thus, despite a large number of apparently relevant papers and a general acceptance of the hypothesis, there is an absence of documented evidence. There is a need for large-scale studies to generate robust data for testing the read-across hypothesis and developing predictive models, the only feasible approach to protecting the environment.",2013,Environmental science & technology,No keywords,"Animals, Ecological and Environmental Phenomena, Humans, Models, Theoretical, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Risk Assessment",10.1021/es402065a,"Biosciences, School of Health Sciences and Social Care, Brunel University , Uxbridge, Middlesex, UB8 3PH, United Kingdom."
Syringe drivers: incorrect selection of syringe type from the syringe menu may result in significant errors in drug delivery.,"L J Tooke, L Howell","There have been many reported adverse incidents due to syringe driver use, most of which have been attributable to human error. In this paper we present a previously unreported, but potentially widespread practice which may result in significant over or under-delivery of medication. Even with the naked eye it is evident that syringes of equal volume have different dimensions and to quantify this we sectioned a range of syringes and measured the inner and outer dimensions. Extensive menus for syringe brand and volumes are available on syringe drivers, offering users greater flexibility. However, this feature also allows users to select an incorrect syringe brand with potential consequences for drug delivery. We measured outputs under all selectable permutations, to determine the degree of fluid delivery variation and discovered inaccuracies in volumes ranging from 10% under-delivery to 24% over-delivery. There is a wide variation in syringe metrics and complex syringe menus may increase errors, resulting in significant under or over-delivery of medication. Availability of more than one brand of syringe in a clinical area increases the risk of adverse drug delivery events.

On-Site Ultrasensitive Detection Paper for Multiclass Chemical Contaminants via Universal Bridge-Antibody Labeling: Mycotoxin and Illegal Additives in Milk as an Example.,"Guanghua Li, Lin Xu, Wenqin Wu, Du Wang, Jun Jiang, Xiaomei Chen, Wen Zhang, Saranya Poapolathep, Amnart Poapolathep, Zhaowei Zhang, Qi Zhang, Peiwu Li","Multiclass chemical contamination of food has aroused ever-increasing attention due to the increasingly common findings of the co-occurrence of multiclass contamination, such as mycotoxin (aflatoxin M1, AFM1) and illegal additive (melamine, MEL). In the present study, a rapid, ultrasensitive detection paper was developed on the basis of a unique bridge-antibody label to realize on-site simultaneous detection of AFM1 and MEL in milk. This detection paper used the bridge-antibody label on fluorescent particles (i.e., the fluorescent Eu nanoparticles were first conjugated with polyclonal antibodies and then with monoclonal antibodies). Dramatically enhanced sensitivity was found, probably due to the increase in immobilization of efficient monoclonal antibodies onto microspheres. Under optimal conditions, the lower limits of detection were 0.009 and 0.024 ng/mL for AFM1 and MEL in milk, respectively, in comparison with similar works. Moreover, the cutoff values were 0.4 and 150 ng/mL for AFM1 and MEL, respectively. The recoveries ranged from 88.7% to 105.0% for AFM1 and from 84.6% to 117.7% for MEL, with relative standard deviations (RSDs) of 0.5-9.9% during the intraday and interday experiments. Comparison experiments conducted using the detection paper, HPLC, and UPLC-MS/MS found excellent agreement in the simultaneous detection of AFM1 and MEL in milk.

"Wood-Derived Materials for Green Electronics, Biological Devices, and Energy Applications.","Hongli Zhu, Wei Luo, Peter N Ciesielski, Zhiqiang Fang, J Y Zhu, Gunnar Henriksson, Michael E Himmel, Liangbing Hu","With the arising of global climate change and resource shortage, in recent years, increased attention has been paid to environmentally friendly materials. Trees are sustainable and renewable materials, which give us shelter and oxygen and remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Trees are a primary resource that human society depends upon every day, for example, homes, heating, furniture, and aircraft. Wood from trees gives us paper, cardboard, and medical supplies, thus impacting our homes, school, work, and play. All of the above-mentioned applications have been well developed over the past thousands of years. However, trees and wood have much more to offer us as advanced materials, impacting emerging high-tech fields, such as bioengineering, flexible electronics, and clean energy. Wood naturally has a hierarchical structure, composed of well-oriented microfibers and tracheids for water, ion, and oxygen transportation during metabolism. At higher magnification, the walls of fiber cells have an interesting morphology-a distinctly mesoporous structure. Moreover, the walls of fiber cells are composed of thousands of fibers (or macrofibrils) oriented in a similar angle. Nanofibrils and nanocrystals can be further liberated from macrofibrils by mechanical, chemical, and enzymatic methods. The obtained nanocellulose has unique optical, mechanical, and barrier properties and is an excellent candidate for chemical modification and reconfiguration. Wood is naturally a composite material, comprised of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Wood is sustainable, earth abundant, strong, biodegradable, biocompatible, and chemically accessible for modification; more importantly, multiscale natural fibers from wood have unique optical properties applicable to different kinds of optoelectronics and photonic devices. Today, the materials derived from wood are ready to be explored for applications in new technology areas, such as electronics, biomedical devices, and energy. The goal of this study is to review the fundamental structures and chemistries of wood and wood-derived materials, which are essential for a wide range of existing and new enabling technologies. The scope of the review covers multiscale materials and assemblies of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin as well as other biomaterials derived from wood, in regard to their major emerging applications. Structure-properties-application relationships will be investigated in detail. Understanding the fundamental properties of these structures is crucial for designing and manufacturing products for emerging applications. Today, a more holistic understanding of the interplay between the structure, chemistry, and performance of wood and wood-derived materials is advancing historical applications of these materials. This new level of understanding also enables a myriad of new and exciting applications, which motivate this review. There are excellent reviews already on the classical topic of woody materials, and some recent reviews also cover new understanding of these materials as well as potential applications.

The second part of the paper is more specific and presents the concept of molecular-property space, an all but neglected concept in SARs. Recent results from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations and Molecular Interaction Fields (MIF) computations of acetylcholine will be used to illustrate not only the well-known conformational space of this molecule, but also its property space as exemplified by its lipophilicity space. It will be seen that a molecule as small as acetylcholine is able to span a relatively broad property space.

The number of studies conducted to characterize pharmaceutical disposal practices is limited, particularly in the Middle East. Objective The aim of this cross-sectional study was to examine the behaviour of individuals with respect to the disposal of expired and unused medications. Furthermore, we aimed to identify the best methods of education regarding appropriate, safe disposal of medication. Setting The study was carried out in King Khalid University Hospital (KKUH), and King Saud University (KSU), during a 3-month period from February 2015 to April 2015. Method Twelve hundred patients were randomly selected from KKUH and KSU. Participants were invited to complete paper-based questionnaire with self enumeration. Pilot testing was conducted and involved 50 randomly selected participants. Main outcome measures The proportion of expired medications present in the home and their therapeutic groups, disposal methods of expired and unused medications, and preferred educational methods regarding safe and proper disposing of medications. Results A substantial proportion (79.15 %) of respondents disposed of unwanted medication via household waste, while a small proportion (1.70 %) returned unwanted medication to a pharmacy. Although currently practised disposal methods are undoubtedly unsuitable, 70.20 % of respondents considered finding appropriate, safe methods via which to dispose of unwanted medication their responsibility, and 78.6 % expressed an interest in receiving information concerning the correct disposal of unwanted medication. Conclusion We have demonstrated that a low percentage of respondents have ever received information regarding correct medication disposal. Moreover, the results have shown that over half of the respondents store antibiotics in their households.

In the current review paper, the work conducted on the uptake of pharmaceuticals belonging to different therapeutic groups such as antibiotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, β-blockers and antiepileptics is reviewed. Such work includes the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in plants, translocation once taken by plants, toxicity studies as well as implications and future studies. Furthermore, the advantages and drawbacks associated with the detection and uptake of these pharmaceuticals by plants are discussed. In addition, the physico-chemical properties that could influence the plant uptake of pharmaceuticals are deliberated.",2018,The Science of the total environment,"Pharmaceuticals, Plant uptake, Toxicity, Translocation","Biological Transport, Crops, Agricultural, Hydroponics, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Plant Roots, Vegetables, Water Pollutants, Chemical",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.04.297,"Department of Chemistry, Durban University of Technology, P.

Paper prototypes for the detection of stereotype violations in (medical) device operation - are they good enough?,"M Susan Hallbeck, Sonja Koneczny, Justine Smith","Controls for most technologies, including medical devices, are becoming increasingly complex, difficult to intuitively understand and don't necessarily follow population stereotypes. The resulting delays and errors are unacceptable when seconds can mean the difference between life and death. In this study participants were asked to ""control"" a system using a paper prototype (color photographs of controls) and then with a higher fidelity prototype of the same physical controls to determine performance differences among ethnicities and genders. No ethnic nor gender differences were found, and the comparison of paper versus higher fidelity prototypes also showed no significant differences. Thus, paper prototypes can be employed as an early device design usability tool to illustrate stereotype violations long before the first physical prototype. This will not only save money in the development and design processes, but also makes sure that even the most complex devices are intuitively understandable and operable for their basic functions.",No date available,Studies in health technology and informatics,No keywords,"Equipment Design, Equipment and Supplies, Ergonomics, Female, Humans, Male, Paper, Task Performance and Analysis",No DOI available,"University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Department of Industrial and Management Systems Engineering, Lincoln, NE, USA."

Pharmaceutical applications of vibrational chemical imaging and chemometrics: a review.,"C Gendrin, Y Roggo, C Collet","The emergence of chemical imaging (CI) has gifted spectroscopy an additional dimension. Chemical imaging systems complement chemical identification by acquiring spatially located spectra that enable visualization of chemical compound distributions. Such techniques are highly relevant to pharmaceutics in that the distribution of excipients and active pharmaceutical ingredient informs not only a product's behavior during manufacture but also its physical attributes (dissolution properties, stability, etc.). The rapid image acquisition made possible by the emergence of focal plane array detectors, combined with publication of the Food and Drug Administration guidelines for process analytical technology in 2001, has heightened interest in the pharmaceutical applications of CI, notably as a tool for enhancing drug quality and understanding process. Papers on the pharmaceutical applications of CI have been appearing in steadily increasing numbers since 2000. The aim of the present paper is to give an overview of infrared, near-infrared and Raman imaging in pharmaceutics.

Container-content interactions with radiopharmaceuticals: Seeing is believing.,"Typhanie Ladrière, Laura Aussage, Jonathan Vigne","This perspective article addresses the critical issue of container-content interactions in the administration of intravenous medications, with a focus on radiopharmaceuticals used in nuclear medicine. Medication administration errors pose a significant challenge to patient safety. The ""five rights"" framework-ensuring the right patient, drug, time, dose, and route-serves as a cornerstone for safe drug administration. In the context of radiopharmaceuticals, notable for their use in nuclear medicine, adherence to these principles is paramount due to their unique properties and role in diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. The article explores the impact of container materials, particularly in syringes, on radiopharmaceutical stability and administration accuracy. It delves into the complexities of sorption phenomena, highlighting studies demonstrating its occurrence and potential consequences, including variations in administered doses and compromised diagnostic or therapeutic outcomes. Noteworthy factors influencing sorption include the type of radiopharmaceutical, container composition, molecular properties, and dilution. Findings revealing residual activity in syringes and identifying specific components, such as lubricants, silicon gaskets, and plungers, contributing to adsorption are presented. Migration of metal contaminants from container to content is discussed, emphasizing the potential impact on radiochemical yield and stability. There is a need for comprehensive studies to characterize drug-container interactions and poses crucial questions about the true benefit patients derive from prescribed activities. It challenges current practices, suggesting a need for tailored activity levels, container validation protocols, and rigorous testing of hospital preparations. Ultimately, this perspective paper calls for a deeper understanding of these interactions, urging regulatory consideration and standardization to ensure optimal drug administration and patient outcomes.",2024,European journal of pharmaceutics and biopharmaceutics : official journal of Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Pharmazeutische Verfahrenstechnik e.V,"Adsorption, Container-content interactions, Hospital preparation, Nuclear medicine, Radiopharmaceuticals, Syringes","Humans, Radiopharmaceuticals, Drug Packaging, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Syringes",10.1016/j.ejpb.2024.114200,"Department of Nuclear Medicine, CHU de Caen Normandie, Normandy University, UNICAEN, 14000 Caen, France; Department of Pharmacy, CHU de Caen Normandie, Normandy University, UNICAEN, 14000 Caen, France., Department of Nuclear Medicine, CHU de Caen Normandie, Normandy University, UNICAEN, 14000 Caen, France; Department of Pharmacy, CHU de Caen Normandie, Normandy University, UNICAEN, 14000 Caen, France., Department of Nuclear Medicine, CHU de Caen Normandie, Normandy University, UNICAEN, 14000 Caen, France; Department of Pharmacy, CHU de Caen Normandie, Normandy University, UNICAEN, 14000 Caen, France; Normandie Université, UNICAEN, INSERM U1237, PhIND, Institut Blood and Brain @ Caen Normandie, Centre Cyceron, 14000 Caen, France.

"Future supply chains enabled by continuous processing--opportunities and challenges. May 20-21, 2014 Continuous Manufacturing Symposium.","Jagjit Singh Srai, Clive Badman, Markus Krumme, Mauricio Futran, Craig Johnston","This paper examines the opportunities and challenges facing the pharmaceutical industry in moving to a primarily ""continuous processing""-based supply chain. The current predominantly ""large batch"" and centralized manufacturing system designed for the ""blockbuster"" drug has driven a slow-paced, inventory heavy operating model that is increasingly regarded as inflexible and unsustainable. Indeed, new markets and the rapidly evolving technology landscape will drive more product variety, shorter product life-cycles, and smaller drug volumes, which will exacerbate an already unsustainable economic model. Future supply chains will be required to enhance affordability and availability for patients and healthcare providers alike despite the increased product complexity. In this more challenging supply scenario, we examine the potential for a more pull driven, near real-time demand-based supply chain, utilizing continuous processing where appropriate as a key element of a more ""flow-through"" operating model. In this discussion paper on future supply chain models underpinned by developments in the continuous manufacture of pharmaceuticals, we have set out; The significant opportunities to moving to a supply chain flow-through operating model, with substantial opportunities in inventory reduction, lead-time to patient, and radically different product assurance/stability regimes. Scenarios for decentralized production models producing a greater variety of products with enhanced volume flexibility. Production, supply, and value chain footprints that are radically different from today's monolithic and centralized batch manufacturing operations. Clinical trial and drug product development cost savings that support more rapid scale-up and market entry models with early involvement of SC designers within New Product Development. The major supply chain and industrial transformational challenges that need to be addressed. The paper recognizes that although current batch operational performance in pharma is far from optimal and not necessarily an appropriate end-state benchmark for batch technology, the adoption of continuous supply chain operating models underpinned by continuous production processing, as full or hybrid solutions in selected product supply chains, can support industry transformations to deliver right-first-time quality at substantially lower inventory profiles.",2015,Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,"bioavailability, biopharmaceuticals characterization, chemical stability, controlled delivery, controlled release, polymorphism, processing, tableting","Animals, Biological Availability, Cost Savings, Cost-Benefit Analysis, Delayed-Action Preparations, Drug Costs, Drug Industry, Drug Stability, Humans, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Quality Control, Solubility, Tablets, Technology, Pharmaceutical, Workflow",10.1002/jps.24343,"Department of Engineering, Institute for Manufacturing, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom."

A dataset of measured human skin permeability of hydrophilic and low hydrophobic solutes has been compiled. Generally statistically derived QSPR models under-estimate skin permeability of hydrophilic solutes. On the other hand, including additional aqueous pathway is necessary for mechanistic models to improve the prediction of skin permeability of hydrophilic solutes, especially for highly hydrophilic solutes. A consensus yet has to be reached as to how the aqueous pathway should be modeled.

Significance of mobile phase composition in enantioseparation of chiral drugs by HPLC on a cellulose-based chiral stationary phase.,Y Tang,"Eight randomly selected pharmaceuticals, which included ibuprofen, ketoprofen, albuterol, acebutolol, propafenone, betaxolol, methylphenidate, and homatropine, were directly separated on a cellulose tris(4-methylbenzoate) chiral stationary phase (CSP) without derivatization via normal phase mode HPLC. Enantioresolution was achieved by the optimization of the type and the ratio of mobile phase modifiers and additives. The modifiers included alcohols; the mobile phase additives were trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and triethylamine (TEA). It was found that methanol and ethanol were superior to isopropanol as mobile phase modifiers for enhancing chiral separation of some of the chiral drugs. The results also demonstrated that TFA has a dominant effect on chiral separations for both acidic and basic chiral drugs, although for some basic drug such as homatropine, TEA was more beneficial at improving enantioseparation. The separation of acebutolol enantiomers was achieved for the first time by adding both TFA and TEA to the mobile phase. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that the applicability of cellulose based CSPs can be expanded by controlling the mobile phase compositions through the addition of trace amounts of achiral additives and the selection of the appropriate alcoholic modifier.",No date available,Chirality,No keywords,"Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Solvents, Stereoisomerism",No DOI available,"Division of Drug Analysis, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, St. Louis, Missouri 63101, USA."

Questions related to a slide show on the usage of prescribed drugs presented at the same time in the attending room but also to general personal habits and attitudes regarding pharmacotherapy. Appreciation of the slide show was remarkable. This was substantiated by the observation that next to the physician media such as news papers, television and broadcast serve as source of information on drugs. Patient-compliance was in part related to lack of correct information. While older patients discontinued treatment because of side-effects, younger patients stopped drugs often because of improvement under therapy.

Quantification of crystalline forms in active pharmaceutical ingredient and tablets by X-ray powder diffraction.,"V Brett Cooper, Gareth E S Pearce, Catherine R Petts","A Merck development compound was known to exist in several polymorphic forms, hydrates and solvates. The polymorphic forms were characterized and the most thermodynamically stable form at room temperature was identified and taken into development. During routine stability analysis it became apparent that the crystalline form of the compound was converting from one form to another in tablets that were stored at 40 degrees C/75% relative humidity in open containers. This form conversion did not occur when the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) alone was stored under these conditions. This paper describes the development and application of an X-ray powder diffraction method for the determination of the relative content of the two crystalline forms in API and within the final formulation.

As chemical processes used to produce drug substances mature from the early phases of development through registration, a concomitant maturing of process-related impurity understanding and control is required. This paper outlines strategies available to pharmaceutical scientists to aid in that understanding. Methodology aspects for impurity investigations are discussed along with an emphasis on understanding the origin and fate of impurities to guide decisions on process controls and specifications. Orthogonal analytical approaches for impurity investigations to provide a complete understanding of a drug substance impurity profile and to aid chemical process development are described. Special considerations necessary for stereochemical impurity investigations are also discussed. Considerations for control of toxic impurities include sensitive and selective analytical methodology and determination of the process capability for removing the impurity. A case study is given where routine analytical testing for a toxic impurity was not required because a high impurity rejection efficiency of the synthetic process was demonstrated. Quality assessment of starting materials from multiple sources and the impact of starting material impurities on the impurity profile of the drug substance are discussed with illustrative examples.

Bioequivalence requirements in the European Union: critical discussion.,"Alfredo García-Arieta, John Gordon","The aim of the present paper is to summarize the revised European Union (EU) Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence and to discuss critically with respect to previous European requirements and present US Food and Drug Administration guidelines its more relevant novelties such as the following: in order to facilitate the development of generic medicinal products, the EU guideline includes the eligibility for Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS)-based biowaivers not only for BCS class I drugs but also for class III drugs with tighter requirements for dissolution and excipient composition. The permeability criterion of BCS classification has been substituted with human absorbability, as per the Biopharmaceutical Drug Disposition Classification System. The widening of the acceptance range for C (max) is possible only for highly variable reference products with an additional clinical justification. This scaled widening is carried out with a proportionality constant of 0.760 which is more conservative than the FDA approach and maintains the consumer risk at a 5% level when the intra-subject CV is close to 30%, due to the smooth transition between the scaled and the constant criteria. The guideline allows for the possibility of two-stage designs to obtain the necessary information on formulation differences and variability from interim analyses as a part of the pivotal bioequivalence study, instead of undertaking pilot studies. The guideline also specifies that the statistical analyses should be performed considering all factors as fixed, which has implications in the case of replicate designs.",2012,The AAPS journal,No keywords,"Drug Design, Drugs, Generic, European Union, Excipients, Guidelines as Topic, Humans, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Solubility, Therapeutic Equivalency, United States, United States Food and Drug Administration",10.1208/s12248-012-9382-1,"Division of Pharmacology and Clinical Evaluation, General Subdirectorate for Human Use Medicines, Spanish Agency for Medicines and Health Care Products, C/Campezo 1, Edificio 8, Planta 2 A, 28022, Madrid, Spain. agarciaa@aemps.es"

Medicinal chemistry design principles for liver targeting through OATP transporters.,"Meihua Tu, Alan M Mathiowetz, Jeffrey A Pfefferkorn, Kimberly O Cameron, Robert L Dow, John Litchfield, Li Di, Bo Feng, Spiros Liras","The tissue distribution of a drug can have significant impact on both its efficacy and safety. As a consequence, selective tissue targeting has become an attractive approach for optimizing the window between efficacy and safety for drug targets that are ubiquitously expressed and important in key physiological processes. Given the liver's key role in metabolic regulation and the fact that it is the principal tissue affected by diseases such as hepatitis B and C viruses as well as hepatocellular carcinoma, designing drugs with hepatoselective distribution profiles is an important strategy in developing safe cardiovascular, metabolic, antiviral and oncology drug candidates. In this paper, we analyze a diverse set of compounds from four different projects within Pfizer that specifically pursued liver targeting strategies. A number of key in vitro and in vivo ADME endpoints were collected including in vivo tissue exposure, oral bioavailability, clearance in preclinical species and in vitro hepatic OATP uptake, in vitro rat liver microsomal stability, permeability, solubility, logD, and others. From this analysis, we determined a set of general structure-liver-selectivity guides for designing orally bioavailable, liver-targeted candidates using liver specific OATP transporters. The guidelines have been formulated using straightforward molecular descriptors and in vitro properties that medicinal chemists routinely optimize. Our analysis emphasizes the need to focus on a chemical space with balanced lipophilicity, high aqueous solubility and low passive permeability in order to achieve the desired hepatoselectivity while maintaining fraction absorbed.",No date available,Current topics in medicinal chemistry,No keywords,"Animals, Chemistry, Pharmaceutical, Drug Design, Humans, Liver, Organic Anion Transporters, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Solubility, Tissue Distribution",No DOI available,"Worldwide Medicinal Chemistry, Pfizer Inc, 620 Memorial Drive, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA. meihua.tu@pfizer.com"

While a collection of older research in most cases dealt with the determination of drug partition coefficient between the aqueous and cell membrane compartments, the link has been overlooked in newer investigations that were mostly focused on drug formulation optimization and their association with particle biodistribution. This gap in the literature motivated us to present the current opinion paper, in which drug physicochemical properties like drug lipophilicity/hydrophilicity is considered as an important element in designing drug-carrying liposomes or micelles. How a hypothetical high throughput cell-embedded chromatographic technique might help to investigate a nanocarrier tissue distribution and to design 'multi-epitope grafted lipid-based drug carrier systems' are discussed. Whenever we would need support for our opinions, we have provided analogy from hydrophobic biomolecules like cholesterol, steroid hormones, and sex hormones and encouraged readers to consider our principle hypothesis: If these molecules could reach their targets far away from the site of production, then a large list of hydrophobic drugs could be delivered to their targets using the same principles.",2019,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,"Drug partition coefficient, Lipid-based particles, Multi-epitope drug delivery system, Protein corona, Protein-protein interaction","Animals, Drug Carriers, Drug Delivery Systems, Humans, Lipid Metabolism, Lipids, Liposomes, Nanocapsules, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Tissue Distribution",10.1016/j.jconrel.2019.07.027,"Natural Products and Medicinal Plants Research Center, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran., Nanotechnology Research Center, Bu-Ali Research Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences Mashhad, Iran., Immunogenetic and Cell Culture Department, Immunology Research Center, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran., Department of Community Medicine, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran., Molecular Medicine Research Center, Hormozgan Health Institute, Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences, Bandar Abbas, Iran.

Cells for the study of acidic dissolution in packed apatite powders as model systems for dental caries.,"H Morgan, R Wilson, J C Elliott, S E Dowker, P Anderson","A number of different designs of cells have been developed for the study of dissolution processes in packed apatite powders. Basic design requirements were that no deleterious processes, such as high temperature sintering or binding agents, were involved, and that there was maximum opportunity for experimental study. One design used alternating filter paper discs and apatite layers (typically 42 mg). At the end of an experiment, the cell could be disassembled and infrared spectra and X-ray powder diffraction patterns made of individual layers. Cells without filter paper discs were also made, but terminal sampling at well-defined depths was more difficult or impossible. The cells were constructed from poly(methylmethacrylate) so the course of dissolution could be monitored by radiography. Subsurface loss of apatite was almost always seen after from 2 weeks to 8 months exposure to buffer solutions at pH 3.0-5.5. The greatest loss of apatite was typically 0.4-2 mm below the surface, which is at a larger distance than usually seen for dental enamel. This may be attributable to the low packing density (typically 35-60 vol%) found in the present systems compared with enamel.",No date available,Caries research,No keywords,"Acids, Apatites, Buffers, Chemistry, Physical, Dental Caries, Dental Enamel, Dental Enamel Solubility, Humans, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Paper, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Powders, Radiography, Solubility, Spectrophotometry, Infrared, Time Factors, X-Ray Diffraction",No DOI available,"Department of Biophysics in Relation to Dentistry, Queen Mary and Westfield College, London, UK h.morgan@mds.qmw.ac.uk"

Formulation approaches in mitigating toxicity of orally administrated drugs.,"Irina Kadiyala, Elijah Tan","This paper provides an overview of current formulation approaches to mitigate toxicity of orally administrated drugs. The formulation approaches are characterized by their intended impact on a drug's pharmacokinetic parameters, pharmacological properties or metabolic pathways. Regulatory opportunities and constraints with focus on U.S. regulations in optimizing a drug's safety or efficacy profile are reviewed. The following formulation approaches are described: (i) pharmacokinetic-modulating and (ii) pharmacodynamic-modulating. In the pharmacokinetic-modulating approach, the pharmacokinetic profile of drug release is modified by, for example, a reduction in peak drug plasma concentration while preserving or improving AUC, thereby potentially reducing toxic effects that may be related to C(max). In the pharmacodynamic-modulating approach, the drug is co-dosed with pharmacologically active or nonpharmacologically active agent or agents intended for mitigation of the drug's toxicity. The pharmacodynamic-modulating approach requires information on the specificity of drug interactions with other compounds and also on metabolic pathways. Examples demonstrating successful formulation work in reducing drug toxicity are provided. The in-depth knowledge of the drug's PK and PD properties combined with a greater understanding of the biology of diseases are necessary for successful drug product formulation leading to optimized in vivo exposure and minimized toxicity.",No date available,Pharmaceutical development and technology,No keywords,"Administration, Oral, Chemistry, Pharmaceutical, Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions, Humans, Metabolic Networks and Pathways, Pharmaceutical Preparations",10.3109/10837450.2012.734516,"Formulation Department, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA 02139-04242, USA. irina_kadiyala@vrtx.com"

"Trade, TRIPS, and pharmaceuticals.","Richard D Smith, Carlos Correa, Cecilia Oh","The World Trade Organization's Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) set global minimum standards for the protection of intellectual property, substantially increasing and expanding intellectual-property rights, and generated clear gains for the pharmaceutical industry and the developed world. The question of whether TRIPS generates gains for developing countries, in the form of increased exports, is addressed in this paper through consideration of the importance of pharmaceuticals in health-care trade, outlining the essential requirements, implications, and issues related to TRIPS, and TRIPS-plus, in which increased restrictions are imposed as part of bilateral free-trade agreements. TRIPS has not generated substantial gains for developing countries, but has further increased pharmaceutical trade in developed countries. The unequal trade between developed and developing countries (ie, exporting and importing high-value patented drugs, respectively) raises the issue of access to medicines, which is exacerbated by TRIPS-plus provisions, although many countries have not even enacted provision for TRIPS flexibilities. Therefore this paper focuses on options that are available to the health community for negotiation to their advantage under TRIPS, and within the presence of TRIPS-plus.",2009,"Lancet (London, England)",No keywords,"Commerce, Developing Countries, Drug Industry, Humans, Intellectual Property, International Cooperation, Malaysia, Pharmaceutical Preparations, World Health Organization",10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61779-1,"Health Policy Unit, Department of Public Health and Policy, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK."

An interesting relationship between drug absorption and melting point.,"Katherine A Chu, Samuel H Yalkowsky","The ability to predict the extent of passive intestinal drug absorption is very important for efficient lead candidate selection and development. Physicochemical-based absorption predictive models previously developed use solubility, partition coefficient and pK(a) as drug input parameters for intestinal absorption. Alternatively, this study looks at the relationship between melting point and passive transport for poorly soluble drugs. It is based entirely on the expression derived from the General Solubility Equation (GSE) that relates melting point to the product of intrinsic solubility and partition coefficient. Given that the melting point of a compound is one of the first and more reliable physical properties measured, it can be advantageously used as a guide in early drug discovery and development. This paper elucidates the interesting relationship between the melting point and dose to the fraction absorbed of poorly soluble drugs, i.e., class II and IV compounds in the Biopharmaceutics Classification System. The newly defined melting point based absorption potential (MPbAP) parameter is successful at distinguishing 90% of the 91 drugs considered being well absorbed (FA>0.5) or poorly absorbed. In general, lower melting compounds are more likely to be well absorbed than higher melting compounds for any given dose. The fraction absorbed for drugs with high melting temperatures is limited by the dose to a greater degree than it is for low melting compounds.",2009,International journal of pharmaceutics,No keywords,"Algorithms, Biological Availability, Humans, Intestinal Absorption, Models, Biological, Molecular Structure, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Pharmacokinetics, Solubility, Transition Temperature",10.1016/j.ijpharm.2009.01.026,"University of Arizona, College of Pharmacy, 1703 E Mabel Street, Tucson, AZ 85721, USA. chu@pharmacy.arizona.edu"

Analysis of low active-pharmaceutical-ingredient signal drugs based on thin layer chromatography and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy.,"Xiao Li, Hui Chen, Qingxia Zhu, Yan Liu, Feng Lu","Active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) embedded in the excipients of the formula can usually be unravelled by normal Raman spectroscopy (NRS). However, more and more drugs with low API content and/or low Raman scattering coefficient were insensitive to NRS analysis, which was for the first time defined as Low API-Signal Drugs (LASIDs) in this paper. The NRS spectra of these LASIDs were similar to their dominant excipients' profiles, such as lactose, starch, microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), etc., and were classified into three types as such. 21 out of 100 kinds of drugs were screened as LASIDs and characterized further by Raman microscopic mapping. Accordingly, we proposed a tailored solution to the qualitation and quantitation problem of these LASIDs, using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopic (SERS) detection on the thin layer chromatographic (TLC) plate both in situ and after-separation. Experimental conditions and parameters including TLC support matrix, SERS substrate, detection mode, similarity threshold, internal standard, etc., were optimized. All LASIDs were satisfactorily identified and the quantitation results agreed well with those of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). For some structural analogues of LASIDs, although they presented highly similar SERS spectra and were tough to distinguish even with Raman microscopic mapping, they could be successfully discriminated from each other by coupling SERS (with portable Raman spectrometer) with TLC.

Depth profiling of inks was performed on overlapping color bands on copy paper by repeatedly scanning the line with a pulsed laser beam operated at a fixed energy. The molecules in the ink on a banknote were desorbed by irradiating the banknote surface with a laser beam operated at different energies, with results indicating that different ions were detected at different depths. The analysis of authentic $US100, $100 RMB and $1000 NTD banknotes indicated that ions detected in 'color-shifting' and 'typography' regions were significantly different. Additionally, the abundances of some ions dramatically changed with the depth of the aforementioned regions. This approach was used to distinguish authentic $1000 NTD banknotes from counterfeits.

This paper provides an overview of the state of the art of CE for such determinations. Detection limits of 0.1% impurity is widely accepted as a minimum requirement for chiral trace impurity determinations. This can be relatively easily achieved with CE. However, determination of lower concentrations requires careful optimization of the separation system. Four factors that are of particular significance for trace enantiomeric determinations: resolution, limit of detection, linear range and type of detection, are discussed. Further, the advantages and disadvantages of derivatization in this context are treated as well as the separation approach, ie., direct chiral separation or separation after the formation of diastereomers.

There is increasing demand for simple methods designed to preserve the biological activity by utilizing the natural properties of polymers. Here, the paper shows that centrifugal lithography (CL) can be used for the fabrication of such microstructures in a single centrifugation, by engineering the self-shaping properties of hyaluronic acid (HA). In this method, HA drops are self-shaped into hourglass-microstructures to produce two dissolving microneedles (DMN), which facilitate transdermal delivery via implantation on the skin. In addition, tuberculin purified protein derivatives are encapsulated into HA DMNs under refrigerated conditions (4 °C) during CL.

Some suggestions for a practical sampling schedule.,"Y L Zeng, A A Akkermans, D D Breimer","During the development of a new computer program for the Loo-Riegelman method for the estimation of the rate drug absorption, it was found that many factors can affect the accuracy of the estimated absorption rate constant (ka). In this paper a survey of the factors affecting the errors in the estimation of ka by the Loo-Riegelman method is made. By simulating data and computer techniques, the effects of factors related to each step in the calculation procedure as well as the influence of certain pharmacokinetic parameters were studied in detail. If these factors are not well controlled, the estimated error in ka will become very large, in some cases even surpassing 30%. In addition, it was derived that careful attention has to be paid to both sampling time and the number of plasma samples. A ""trial and error"" method for obtaining an optimal sampling schedule that minimizes the error of ka is presented.",No date available,Arzneimittel-Forschung,No keywords,"Intestinal Absorption, Kinetics, Models, Biological, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Software",No DOI available,

Safety assessment of drug impurities for patient safety: A comprehensive review.,Frank Liu,"Drug impurities are undesirable but unavoidable chemicals which can occur throughout the drug life cycle. The safety implications of drug impurities can be significant given that they can impact safety, quality, and efficacy of drug products and that certain drug impurities are mutagenic, carcinogenic, or teratogenic. The characteristics of drug impurities could be specific to drug modalities (e.g., small molecules vs. biologics). The commonly encountered drug impurities include elemental impurity, residual solvent, organic impurity, host cell protein and DNA, residual viral vector, extractable and leachable, and particle. They can cause various adverse effects such as immunogenicity, infection, genotoxicity, and carcinogenicity upon significant exposure. Therefore, the effective control of these drug impurities is central for patient safety. Regulations and guidelines are available for drug developers to manage them. Their qualification is obtained based on authoritative qualification thresholds or safety assessment following the classic toxicological risk assessment. The current review focuses on the safety assessment science and methodology used for diverse types of drug impurities. Due to the different nature of diverse drug impurities, their safety assessment represents a significant challenge for drug developers.",2024,Regulatory toxicology and pharmacology : RTP,"Drug product, Impurity, Patient safety, Safety assessment","Drug Contamination, Humans, Patient Safety, Risk Assessment, Animals, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions",10.1016/j.yrtph.2024.105715,"Safe Product Services LLC, Pittsfield, MA, USA.

Stimuli-responsive molecularly imprinted polymers for drug delivery: a review.,"Francesco Puoci, Francesca Iemma, Nevio Picci","Molecular imprinting is an efficient technique for introducing regions with a highly specific molecular arrangement into a polymeric matrix. The first example of a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) was reported half a century ago; however, the use of molecular imprinting has become a well established practical tool only in the last decade. Recently, MIPs are widely used, for example, in chromatographic applications or enzyme antibody mimics. MIPs have also been used in biological applications such as drug delivery systems (DDS), and they have also been successfully applied as excipients in controlled delivery systems. Their huge potential could bring about intelligent drug release; this refers to the release, in a predictable way, of therapeutic agents in response to specific environmental stimuli (the presence of another molecule, pH changes, temperature, etc.). This review is focused on particular intelligent devices of this type that exhibit selective recognition (traps for toxic molecules) and release (of drugs in order to prolong the duration of pharmacological action) in response to specific stimuli.

Removal of lipophilic extractives from paper pulp by laccase and lignin-derived phenols as natural mediators.,"Ana Gutiérrez, Jorge Rencoret, David Ibarra, Setefilla Molina, Susana Camarero, Javier Romero, José C Del Río, Angel T Martínez","In this paper, we show for the first time that lignin-derived phenols can act as laccase mediators for the removal of lipophilic compounds from paper pulp. These natural mediators represent an alternative to synthetic mediators, such as 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT), that cause some economic and environmental concerns. Unbleached kraft pulp from eucalypt wood, which contained free and conjugated sterols responsible for pitch deposition in the manufacture of totally chlorine free paper, was treated with a fungal laccase in the presence of syringaldehyde, acetosyringone, and p-coumaric acid as mediators. The composition of lipophilic extractives in the pulps after the enzymatic treatment followed by a hydrogen peroxide stage was analyzed by gas chromatography and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The enzymatic treatment using syringaldehyde as laccase mediator caused the highest removal (over 90%) of free and conjugated sitosterol, similar to that attained with HBT, followed by acetosyringone (over 60% removal), whereas p-coumaric acid was barely effective. Moreover, recalcitrant oxidized steroids surviving laccase-HBT treatment could be removed when using these natural mediators. Pulp brightness was also improved (from 57% to 66% ISO brightness) by the laccase treatment in the presence of the above phenols followed by the peroxide stage due to the simultaneous removal of lignin.",No date available,Environmental science & technology,No keywords,"Acetophenones, Benzaldehydes, Coumaric Acids, Eucalyptus, Industrial Waste, Laccase, Lignin, Paper, Phenols, Plant Extracts, Propionates, Waste Management, Wood",No DOI available,"Instituto de Recursos Naturales y Agrobiología de Sevilla, CSIC, PO Box 1052, E-41080 Seville, Spain. anagu@irnase.csic.es"

Optimizing the Electron-Withdrawing Character on Benzenesulfonyl Moiety Attached to a Glyco-Conjugate to Impart Sensitive and Selective Sensing of Cyanide in HEPES Buffer and on Cellulose Paper and Silica Gel Strips.,"Sivaiah Areti, Sateesh Bandaru, Deepthi S Yarramala, Chebrolu Pulla Rao","Dansyl-derivatized, triazole-linked, glucopyranosyl conjugates, (5F)LOH, (2F)LOH, (1F)LOH, and (0F)LOH were synthesized and characterized. While the (5F)LOH acts as a molecular probe for CN(-), (2F)LOH, (1F)LOH, and (0F)LOH acts as control molecules. The reactivity of CN(-) toward (5F)LOH has been elicited through the changes observed in NMR, ESI MS, emission, and absorption spectroscopy. The conjugate (5F)LOH releases a fluorescent product upon reaction by CN(-) in aqueous acetonitrile medium by exhibiting an ∼125-fold fluorescence enhancement even in the presence of other anions. Fluorescence switch-on behavior has been clearly demonstrated on the basis of the nucleophilic substitution reaction of CN(-) on (5F)LOH. A minimum detection limit of (2.3 ± 0.3) × 10(-7) M (6 ± 1 ppb) was shown by (5F)LOH for CN(-) in solution. All the other anions studied showed no change in the fluorescence emission. The utility of (5F)LOH has been demonstrated by showing its reactivity toward CN(-) on a thin layer of silica gel as well as on Whatman No. 1 cellulose filter paper strips. The role of glucose moiety and the penta-fluorobenzenesulfonyl reactive center present in (5F)LOH in the selectivity of CN(-) over other anions has been demonstrated by fluorescence, absorption and thermodynamics study. Similar studies carried out with the control molecules showed no selectivity for CN(-).

European Paediatric Formulation Initiative workshop report: Improving the administration of oral liquid medicines in paediatrics using dosing syringes and enteral accessories.,"Jennifer Walsh, Diana van Riet-Nales, Esmerald Hermans, Rutger de Vries, Gareth Hilton, Paul Blowers, Smita Salunke","Accurate dosing of the right medicine to the right patient is a key element of safe and efficacious pharmacotherapy, yet prone to technical challenges and human error when dosing involves the administration of small volumes of liquid medicines. For this reason, the topic has gained increased attention over the last decade from multiple stakeholder parties e.g. academia, hospital pharmacy, the medical device and pharmaceutical industry, and regulatory agencies. It is now well acknowledged that spoons and cups are not suitable for the measurement of small volumes of oral liquid medicines and that syringes are a better alternative, but syringes for parenteral use should not be used for oral dosing in order to avoid accidental parenteral delivery of oral products. However, dosing accuracy of very small volumes of liquid medicines to young children, and especially pre-term neonates, is still not sufficiently ensured. A workshop was organised in 2018 by the European Paediatric Formulation Initiative to reflect on current status and challenges (first part) and possible strategies to improve the present situation (second part).

Sequential processing strategies for fingermark visualisation on uncirculated £10 (Bank of England) polymer banknotes.,"Rory P Downham, Eleigh R Brewer, Roberto S P King, Vaughn G Sears","An investigation was undertaken to assess the relative effectiveness of five fingermark visualisation process sequences on new, uncirculated £10 polymer banknotes from the Bank of England (BoE). Each sequence was challenged with the visualisation of 64 natural fingermarks on eight banknotes, of which half were aged for 2-3days and half were aged for 12-13days (32 donors contributed in each set). The sequences investigated were; After each process was applied, fingermark development was assessed under primary viewing conditions appropriate to the technique (white light or fluorescence). All samples were also assessed under secondary viewing conditions; provided by the optical processes infrared reflection and long-wave ultraviolet reflection, and by gelatin lifting (with scanning). These additional techniques reduced the interfering effect of the complex banknote backgrounds and improved the contrast of enhanced fingermarks. Overall, with all assessment conditions considered, sequence 4 and sequence 3 visualised the most identifiable quality fingermarks (92.2% and 89.1% respectively). The most effective overall process used singularly was found to be black magnetic powder, provided that reflected infrared was used to image the results (82.8%). Further data analysis revealed that sequence 1 was the most effective sequence for fresh marks (aged 2-3days) when only primary viewing conditions within the visible part of the spectrum are considered.

Pronounced effect of lamination on plasma separation from whole blood by microfluidic paper-based analytical devices.,"Farshad Ardakani, Bahram Hemmateenejad","Many diseases are detected through blood tests. Currently, most blood tests are done on plasma instead of whole blood because of the interference of blood cells on detection results. Here, we developed a laminated microfluidic paper-based analytical device (L-μPAD) for the separation of plasma from whole blood without using plasma separation membrane (PSM). A lateral flow design consisting of a circular sampling zone and rectangular detection zone was patterned on the paper substrate using laser printing technology. The μPAD was then laminated after impregnation with KCl solution. Lamination and electrolyte addition represented synergistic effects on the separation by controlling the pore size of the paper. In addition, by preventing evaporation on one hand and squeezing paper pores on the other hand, lamination caused longer movement of the separated plasma, the longest plasma path reported so far. The separation process was monitored using colorimetric reagent bromocresol green and scanning electron microscopy. The process of separation was completed in less than 90s without significant hemolysis and the separated plasma was far from the interfering effect of red blood cells. We used the device for the determination of serum albumin.

Recent advances in lab-on-paper diagnostic devices using blood samples.,"Wen-Chin Lee, Hwee-Yeong Ng, Chih-Yao Hou, Chien-Te Lee, Lung-Ming Fu","Lab-on-paper, or microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (μPADs), use paper as a substrate material, and are patterned with a system of microchannels, reaction zones and sensing elements to perform analysis and detection. The sample transfer in such devices is performed by capillary action. As a result, external driving forces are not required, and hence the size and cost of the device are significantly reduced. Lab-on-paper devices have thus attracted significant attention for point-of-care medical diagnostic purposes in recent years, particularly in less-developed regions of the world lacking medical resources and infrastructures. This review discusses the major advances in lab-on-paper technology for blood analysis and diagnosis in the past five years. The review focuses particularly on the many clinical applications of lab-on-paper devices, including diabetes diagnosis, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) detection, kidney function diagnosis, liver function diagnosis, cholesterol and triglyceride (TG) analysis, sickle-cell disease (SCD) and phenylketonuria (PKU) analysis, virus analysis, C-reactive protein (CRP) analysis, blood ion analysis, cancer factor analysis, and drug analysis.

Unfortunately, there are still some barriers limiting the large-scale deployment of these innovative technologies in the healthcare field. Among these, the evaluation of potential thermal and non-thermal effects due to the exposure of biopharmaceutical products to electromagnetic fields is very challenging, but still slightly investigated. This paper aims to setup a controlled RF exposure environment, in order to reproduce a worst-case exposure of pharmaceutical products to the electromagnetic fields generated by the UHF RFID devices placed along the supply chain.

Streamlined approach to high-quality purification and identification of compound series using high-resolution MS and NMR.,"Anneke Mühlebach, Joachim Adam, Uwe Schön","Automated medicinal chemistry (parallel chemistry) has become an integral part of the drug-discovery process in almost every large pharmaceutical company. Parallel array synthesis of individual organic compounds has been used extensively to generate diverse structural libraries to support different phases of the drug-discovery process, such as hit-to-lead, lead finding, or lead optimization. In order to guarantee effective project support, efficiency in the production of compound libraries has been maximized. As a consequence, also throughput in chromatographic purification and analysis has been adapted. As a recent trend, more laboratories are preparing smaller, yet more focused libraries with even increasing demands towards quality, i.e. optimal purity and unambiguous confirmation of identity. This paper presents an automated approach how to combine effective purification and structural conformation of a lead optimization library created by microwave-assisted organic synthesis.

Effective exposure of chemicals in in vitro cell systems: A review of chemical distribution models.,"Susana Proença, Beate I Escher, Fabian C Fischer, Ciarán Fisher, Sébastien Grégoire, Nicky J Hewitt, Beate Nicol, Alicia Paini, Nynke I Kramer","Nominal effect concentrations from in vitro toxicity assays may lead to inaccurate estimations of in vivo toxic doses because the nominal concentration poorly reflects the concentration at the molecular target in cells in vitro, which is responsible for initiating effects and can be referred to as the biologically effective dose. Chemicals can differentially distribute between in vitro assay compartments, including serum constituents in exposure medium, microtitre plate plastic, headspace and extracellular matrices. The partitioning of test chemicals to these extracellular compartments reduces the concentration at the molecular target. Free concentrations in medium and cell-associated concentrations are considered better proxies of the biologically effective dose. This paper reviews the mechanisms by which test chemicals distribute between in vitro assay compartments, and also lists the physicochemical properties driving the extent of this distribution. The mechanisms and physicochemical properties driving the distribution of test chemical in vitro help explain the makeup of mass balance models that estimate free concentrations and cell-associated concentrations in in vitro toxicity assays.

Recent advances on aqueous solubility prediction.,"Junmei Wang, Tingjun Hou","Aqueous solubility is one of the major physiochemical properties to be optimized in drug discovery. It is related to absorption and distribution in the ADME-Tox (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity). Aqueous solubility and membrane permeability are the two key factors that affect a drug's oral bioavailability. Because of the importance of aqueous solubility, a lot of efforts have been spent on developing reliable models to predict this physiochemical property. Although some progress has been made and a lot of models have been constructed, it is concluded that accurate and reliable aqueous models targeted to predict solubility of drug-like molecules, have not emerged based on the outcome of an aqueous solubility prediction campaign sponsored by Goodman et al. In this review paper, we provide a snapshot of the latest development in the field. The challenges of developing high quality aqueous solubility models as well as the strategies of surmounting those challenges have been discussed. We conclude that the biggest challenge of modeling aqueous solubility is to collect more high quality, unskewed and drug-relevant solubility data which are sufficient diverse to cover most the chemical space of drugs. The second challenge is to develop good descriptors to account for the lattice energy of solvation. In order to develop accurate and predictable in silico solubility models, the key is to collect a sufficient number of high quality experimental data and the suspicious data must be verified. In addition, the molecular descriptors must be relevant to the energies in the solvation process (the lattice energy for crystal packing, the energy of forming cavity in solvent, and the solvation energy), and the models must be carefully cross-validated and evaluated using the external data sets.",No date available,Combinatorial chemistry & high throughput screening,No keywords,"Drug Discovery, Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions, Models, Biological, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Solubility, Water",No DOI available,"Department of Pharmacology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, 75390-9050, USA. junmwang@yahoo.com"
Novel analytical solutions for convolution in compartmental pharmacokinetic models and application to non-bioequivalent formulations.,"Mauricio A García, Pablo M González, Alexis Aceituno, Jozef Al-Gousous","Deconvolution and convolution are powerful tools that allow decomposition and reconstruction, respectively, of plasma versus time profiles from input and impulse functions. While deconvolution have commonly used compartmental approaches (e.g., Wagner-Nelson or Loo-Riegelman), convolution most typically used the convolution integral which can be solved with numerical methods. In 2005, an analytical solution for one-compartment pharmacokinetic was proposed and has been widely used ever since. However, to the best of our knowledge, analytical solutions for drugs distributed in more than one compartment have not been reported yet. In this paper, analytical solutions for compartmental convolution from both original and exact Loo-Riegelman approaches were developed and evaluated for different scenarios. While convolution from original approach was slightly more precise than that from the exact Loo-Riegelman, both methods were extremely accurate for reconstruction of plasma profiles after respective deconvolutions. Nonetheless, convolution from exact Loo-Riegelman was easier to interpret and to be manipulated mathematically. In fact, convolution solutions for three and more compartments can be easily written with this approach. Finally, our convolution analytical solution was applied to predict the failure in bioequivalence for levonorgestrel, demonstrating that equations in this paper may be useful tools for pharmaceutical scientists.",2024,European journal of pharmaceutical sciences : official journal of the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences,"Analytical solution, Bioinequivalence, Convolution, Correlation, Deconvolution, Levonorgestrel, Loo Riegelman","Therapeutic Equivalency, Models, Biological, Pharmacokinetics, Humans, Chemistry, Pharmaceutical, Pharmaceutical Preparations",10.1016/j.ejps.2024.106892,"Departamento de Farmacia, Escuela de Química y Farmacia, Facultad de Química y de Farmacia, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago, 7820436, Chile.

Portable medicine chests and supply of medicines in Serbia from the 1830s to the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century: analysis of medicines list.,"J Arsić, D Krajnović","The first portable medicine chests appeared in Serbia immediately after liberation from Ottoman rule around 1830. The network of portable medicine chests grew very quickly and became the first effective public health method of supplying medicines and medical items to people living in cities without community pharmacies and to the rural population in villages. According to their purposes, three categories of portable medicine chests could be identified: Portable medicine chests owned by physicians or veterinarians in the cities, portable medicine chests established by the Department of Workers Health Insurance, and portable medicine chests of the Health Cooperatives that operated in the villages This paper analyzes all three types of portable medicine chests. We specifically examine the regulations concerning the management of portable medicine chests, their content, and supply chains of medicines from the third decade of the 19 th century through the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. We conclude that portable medicine chests represent a specific type of pharmacy in the territory of Serbia that provided very effective medical service. The medicines in these pharmacies were handled and dispensed to patients by physicians not by pharmacists.

Scattering orthogonalization of near-infrared spectra for analysis of pharmaceutical tablets.,"Zhenqi Shi, Carl A Anderson","The paper explores scattering orthogonalization as a preprocessing technique to reduce physical interference and maintain chemical information in near-infrared (NIR) spectra of pharmaceutical tablets. Samples used in this study were tablets compressed at five compression forces; they were composed of theophylline, lactose, and microcrystalline cellulose (PH200). The NIR spectra were orthogonalized against the reduced scattering coefficients (representative of physical interference of scattering), and concentrations of all constituents were predicted. The robustness of predictions was compared to the widely employed standard normal variate (SNV) for the specificity of removing interference representative of physical parameter (such as tablet density). Group-wise cross-validation (groups were based upon similar chemical composition) and prediction demonstrated the enhanced robustness on prediction of chemical information via scattering orthogonalization in comparison to SNV. When compared to the SNV, scattering orthogonalization demonstrated an improved capacity to reduce physical interference while maintaining spectral variance attributable to chemical information.

"Microdosing, imaging biomarkers and SPECT: a multi-sided tripod to accelerate drug development.","Ernest K J Pauwels, Kim Bergstrom, Giuliano Mariani, Kalevi Kairemo","The advances of nuclear medicine imaging instrumentation and radiopharmaceutical sciences allow their involvement in the developmental processes of therapeutic drugs. New chemical entities, meant as potential drugs, need to comply with the proof-of-principle. Tomographic imaging methods as PET, SPECT and CT have been used for small animal and human studies at an early stage of drug development. Using a drug candidate in a radiolabeled form in obtaining quantitative imaging data provides opportunity for a complete morphological and functional overview of targeting properties and overall pharmacokinetics. This can be helpful in go/no-go decision making. Microdosing, using e.g.1% of the proposed dose of the radiolabeled potential drug plays an important part in this early development and notably reduces the risk of serious adverse effects in human volunteers or patients. This paper primarily focuses on the way in which microdosing and SPECT imaging may contribute to the development of drugs. Furthermore, this paper illustrates how these techniques may help to eliminate weak drug candidates at early stage, making time and funds available for potential lead compounds.

Prospectives of Solid Self-microemulsifying Systems in Novel Drug Delivery.,"Kanav Midha, Manju Nagpal, Garima Singh, Geeta Aggarwal","More than 60% of the new drug molecules are lipophilic in nature. Low aqueous solubility and thus poor bioavailability is the main issue for these drugs for successful formulations into oral dosage form. Self-microemulsifying drug delivery systems (SMEDDS) have gained much attention. These are isotropic mixtures of different components (oil, surfactant and cosurfactant) that quickly disperse in gastrointestinal fluid yielding micro/nano-emulsions. These systems contain solubilized drug that is absorbed by lymphatic pathway along with other pathways like diffusion, collisional transfer, intracellular junctions, biliary acid pathway (BA), biliary acid mixed micelles pathway (BAMM) etc. and thus hepatic first pass metabolism is reduced. Stability of conventional SEDDS is considered very high with reference to other drug delivery systems as liposome, nanoparticles, nanoemulsion and micro emulsion. In fact SEDDS does not contain water in their composition which enhances their chemical and physical stability. Very few works have studied the stability of conventional SEDDS as it was confirmed. The major drawback for conventional SEDDS could be- i) high manufacturing cost (as they have to be filled in soft gelatin capsules); ii) interaction of capsule shell components with SEDDS. Therefore, attention has been given to transform liquid into solid SMEDDS by several techniques such as spray drying, spray cooling, super critical fluid technology and using adsorption carriers. Adsorption using solid carriers (Neusilin, Fujicalin, and dextran) is the successful inexpensive technique at initial research level whereas other requires expensive instrumentation.",No date available,Current drug delivery,"Adsorption, carrier, co-surfactant, fujicalin, neusilin, self-emulsification","Biopharmaceutics, Drug Carriers, Drug Delivery Systems, Emulsions, Humans, Pharmaceutical Preparations",10.2174/1567201813666160824123504,"Chitkara College of Pharmacy, Chitkara University, Patiala, Punjab.

Systematic toxicological analysis procedures for acidic drugs and/or metabolites relevant to clinical and forensic toxicology and/or doping control.,H H Maurer,"This paper reviews systematic toxicological analysis (STA) procedures for acidic drugs and/or metabolites relevant to clinical and forensic toxicology or doping control using gas chromatography, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, liquid chromatography, thin-layer chromatography and capillary electrophoresis. Papers from 1992 to 1998 have been taken into consideration. Screening procedures in biosamples (whole blood, plasma, serum, urine, vitreous humor, brain, liver or hair) of humans or animals (horse, or rat) are included for the following drug classes: angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II (AT-II) blockers, anticoagulants of the 4-hydroxy coumarin type, barbiturates, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (calcium antagonists), diuretics, hypoglycemic sulfonylureas and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Methods for confirmation of preliminary results obtained by screening procedures using immunoassay or chromatographic techniques are also included. Furthermore, procedures for the simultaneous detection of several drug classes are reviewed. The toxicological question to be answered and the consequences for the choice of an adequate method, the sample preparation and the chromatography itself are discussed. The basic information about the biosample assayed, work-up, separation column, mobile phase or separation buffer, detection mode and validation data of each procedure is summarized in 16 tables.

The effects of temperature, sulfuric acid concentration, and mass of raw material and time on the yield of NCWs were investigated by single-factor experiments, and the preparation conditions were optimized with response surface methodology. The obtained NCWs were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and thermal gravimetry. The results showed NCWs were facilely prepared by using SUMAT. However, some harsh reaction conditions such as high temperature, strong acidity and long time treatment easily induced the reduction of the yield of NCWs.

Immobilized aptamer paper spray ionization source for ion mobility spectrometry.,"Tahereh Zargar, Taghi Khayamian, Mohammad T Jafari","A selective thin-film microextraction based on aptamer immobilized on cellulose paper was used as a paper spray ionization source for ion mobility spectrometry (PSI-IMS), for the first time. In this method, the paper is not only used as an ionization source but also it is utilized for the selective extraction of analyte, based on immobilized aptamer. This combination integrates both sample preparation and analyte ionization in a Whatman paper. To that end, an appropriate sample introduction system with a novel design was constructed for the paper spray ionization source. Using this system, a continuous solvent flow works as an elution and spray solvent simultaneously. In this method, analyte is adsorbed on a triangular paper with immobilized aptamer and then it is desorbed and ionized by elution solvent and applied high voltage on paper, respectively. The effects of different experimental parameters such as applied voltage, angle of paper tip, distance between paper tip and counter electrode, elution solvent type, and solvent flow rate were optimized. The proposed method was exhaustively validated in terms of sensitivity and reproducibility by analyzing the standard solutions of codeine and acetamiprid.

Medicating the environment: assessing risks of pharmaceuticals to wildlife and ecosystems.,"Kathryn E Arnold, A Ross Brown, Gerald T Ankley, John P Sumpter","Global pharmaceutical consumption is rising with the growing and ageing human population and more intensive food production. Recent studies have revealed pharmaceutical residues in a wide range of ecosystems and organisms. Environmental concentrations are often low, but pharmaceuticals typically are designed to have biological effects at low doses, acting on physiological systems that can be evolutionarily conserved across taxa. This Theme Issue introduces the latest research investigating the risks of environmentally relevant concentrations of pharmaceuticals to vertebrate wildlife. We take a holistic, global view of environmental exposure to pharmaceuticals encompassing terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems in high- and low-income countries. Based on both field and laboratory data, the evidence for and relevance of changes to physiology and behaviour, in addition to mortality and reproductive effects, are examined in terms of the population- and community-level consequences of pharmaceutical exposure on wildlife. Studies on uptake, trophic transfer and indirect effects of pharmaceuticals acting via food webs are presented. Given the logistical and ethical complexities of research in this area, several papers focus on techniques for prioritizing which compounds are most likely to harm wildlife and how modelling approaches can make predictions about the bioavailability, metabolism and toxicity of pharmaceuticals in non-target species.

Fibers were characterized by SEM-EDX patterns, while the phytoconstituents in ethanol extract was analyzed by HPLC. The inhibition percentage of fungal mycelial growth (IFMG) of the treated Melia azedarach wood with M. oleifera SRRP extract at the concentrations of 10,000, 20,000, and 30,000 µg/mL against the growth of Rhizoctonia solani and Fusarium culmorum was calculated and compared with fluconazole (25 µg). The produced papersheet was treated with the ethanol extract (4000, 2000, and 1000 µg/mL) and assayed for its antibacterial activity against Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Erwinia amylovora, and Pectobacterium atrosepticum by measuring the inhibition zones and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). According to chemical analysis of M. oleifera SRRP, benzene:alcohol extractives, holocellulose, lignin, and ash contents were 7.56, 64.94, 25.66 and 1.53%, respectively, while for the produced unbleached pulp, the screen pulp yield and the Kappa number were 39% and 25, respectively. The produced papersheet showed tensile index, tear index, burst index, and double fold number values of 58.8 N m/g, 3.38 mN m<sup>2</sup>/g, 3.86 kPa m<sup>2</sup>/g, and 10.66, respectively.

Marketed oral drugs will generally possess favorable physiochemical properties with respect to absorption, metabolism, distribution, and clearance. This paper describes a study in which the distributions of physiochemical properties of oral drugs in different phases of clinical development are compared to those already marketed. The aim is to identify the trends in physiochemical properties that favor a drug's successful passage through clinical development and on to the market. Two libraries were created, one of current development oral drugs and one of marketed oral drugs. Statistical analysis of the two showed that the mean molecular weight of orally administered drugs in development decreases on passing through each of the different clinical phases and gradually converges toward the mean molecular weight of marketed oral drugs.

Absorption enhancers: applications and advances.,Bruce J Aungst,"Absorption enhancers are functional excipients included in formulations to improve the absorption of a pharmacologically active drug. The term absorption enhancer usually refers to an agent whose function is to increase absorption by enhancing membrane permeation, rather than increasing solubility, so such agents are sometimes more specifically termed permeation enhancers. Absorption enhancers have been investigated for at least two decades, particularly in efforts to develop non-injection formulations for peptides, proteins, and other pharmacologically active compounds that have poor membrane permeability. While at least one product utilizing an absorption enhancer for transdermal use has reached the market, quite a few more appear to be at the threshold of becoming products, and these include oral and transmucosal applications. This paper will review some of the most advanced absorption enhancers currently in development and the formulation technologies employed that have led to their success. In addition, a more basic review of the barriers to absorption and the mechanisms by which those barriers can be surmounted is presented. Factors influencing the success of absorption-enhancing formulations are discussed. If ultimately successful, the products now in development should offer non-injection alternatives for several peptide or protein drugs currently only administered by injection. The introduction of new absorption enhancers as accepted pharmaceutical excipients, and the development of formulation technologies that afford the greatest benefit/risk ratio for their use, may create opportunities to apply these enabling technologies more broadly to existing drugs with non-optimal delivery properties.",2011,The AAPS journal,No keywords,"Animals, Excipients, Humans, Peptides, Permeability, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Proteins, Solubility, Technology, Pharmaceutical",10.1208/s12248-011-9307-4,"QPS, LLC, Newark, Delaware 19702, USA. bruce.aungst@qps.com"
Control and analysis of alkyl and benzyl halides and other related reactive organohalides as potential genotoxic impurities in active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).,"D P Elder, A M Lipczynski, A Teasdale","This paper continues the review of the relevant scientific literature associated with the control and analysis of potential genotoxic impurities (PGIs) in active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). The initial review [D.P. Elder, A. Teasdale, A.M. Lipczynski, J. Pharm. Biomed. Anal. 46 (2008) 1-8.] focused on the specific class of sulfonate esters but in this instance reference is made to the analysis of alkyl and benzyl halides and other related reactive organohalide alkylating agents. Such reactive materials are commonly employed in pharmaceutical research and development as raw materials, reagents and intermediates in the chemical synthesis of new drug substances. Consequently a great deal of attention and effort is extended by the innovative and ethical pharmaceutical industry to ensure that appropriate and practicable control strategies are established during drug development to ensure residues of such agents, as potential impurities in new drug substances, are either eliminated or minimized to such an extent so as to not present a significant safety risk to volunteers and patients in clinical trials and beyond. The reliable trace analysis of such reactive organohalides is central to such control strategies and invariably involves a state-of-the-art combination of high-resolution separation science techniques coupled to sensitive and selective modes of detection. This article reports on the most recent developments in the regulatory environment, overall strategies for the control of alkylating agents and the latest developments in analysis culminating in a literature review of analytical approaches. The literature is sub-categorized by separation technique (gas chromatography (GC), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), thin layer chromatography (TLC) and capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE)) and further tabulated by API type and impurity with brief method details and references.

Biomolecular Network Controllability With Drug Binding Information.,"Lin Wu, Lingkai Tang, Min Li, Jianxin Wang, Fang-Xiang Wu","Complex networks are ubiquitous in nature. In biological systems, biomolecules interact with each other to form so-called biomolecular networks, which determine the cellular behaviors of living organisms. Controlling the cellular behaviors by regulating certain biomolecules in the network is one of the most concerned problems in systems biology. Recently, the connections between biological networks and structural control theory have been explored, uncovering some interesting biological phenomena. Some researchers have paid attentions to the structural controllability of networks in notion of the minimum steering sets (MSSs). However, because the MSSs for complex networks are not unique and the importance of different MSSs is diverse in real applications, MSSs with certain meanings should be studied. In this paper, we investigated the MSSs of biomolecular networks by considering the drug binding information. The biomolecules in the MSSs with binding preference are enriched with known drug targets and are likely to have more chemical-binding opportunities with existing drugs compared with randomly chosen MSSs, suggesting novel applications for drug target identification and drug repositioning.",No date available,IEEE transactions on nanobioscience,No keywords,"Algorithms, Computer Simulation, Models, Biological, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Protein Binding, Proteins, Signal Transduction",10.1109/TNB.2017.2705106,

NAs bind electrostatically to Q-paper, but the quantity of NA bound depends on the paper's binding capacity. To optimize the original technology for mosquito surveillance, factors that affected NA absorbance on Q-paper were evaluated. Sixteen variations of Q-paper were prepared with modifications of the derivatizing reagents and derivatization temperature.

[Alternatives for adopting policies centered on access to medicines].,"Federico Tobar, Ignacio Drake, Evangelina Martich","Latin America is adopting regulations that bear on medicinal costs and spending. The regulations have four main goals: i) to guarantee a competitive market, ii) to ensure affordability for individual consumers (commercial channel), iii) to contain public spending on medicines (institutional channel), and iv) to guarantee efficient spending on medicines. The experience of Latin America differs from that of countries in developed regions. In the latter, the countries tend to have similar policies, both in promoting generic medicines and in price control strategies, and in optimizing and containing pharmaceutical expense. In contrast, in Latin America, certain institutional weaknesses impede the consolidation and application of an effective regulatory policy. This paper reviews the experience gained through the adoption of economic regulations aimed at reducing spending and improving access to medicines, suggests lessons learned at the international level, and offers recommendations for the countries of Latin America. Its purpose is to offer key elements to decision-makers and the authorities of the countries concerned in pursuing economic regulation of medicines.",No date available,Revista panamericana de salud publica = Pan American journal of public health,No keywords,"Guidelines as Topic, Health Policy, Humans, Latin America, Legislation, Drug, Pharmaceutical Preparations",S1020-49892012001400010,"Universidad de Buenos Aires (UBA), Buenos Aires, Argentina."

Electrostatics of Pharmaceutical Aerosols for Pulmonary Delivery.,Philip Chi Lip Kwok,"This paper provides a review on key research findings in the rapidly developing area of pharmaceutical aerosol electrostatics. Solids and liquids can become charged without electric fields, the former by contact or friction and the latter by flowing or spraying. Therefore, charged particles and droplets carrying net charges are produced from pharmaceutical inhalers (e.g. dry powder inhalers, metered dose inhalers, and nebulisers) due to the mechanical processes involved in aerosolisation. The charging depends on many physicochemical factors, such as formulation composition, solid state properties, inhaler material and design, and relative humidity. In silico, in vitro, and limited in vivo studies have shown that electrostatic charges may potentially influence particle deposition in the airways. However, the evidence is not yet conclusive. Furthermore, there are currently no regulatory requirements on the characterisation and control of the electrostatic properties of inhaled formulations. Besides the need for further investigations on the relationship between physicochemical factors and charging characteristics of the aerosols, controlled and detailed in vivo studies are also required to confirm whether charges can affect particle deposition in the airways. Since pharmaceutical aerosol electrostatics is a relatively new research area, much remains to be explored. Thus there is certainly potential for development.

Essential drugs for ration kits in developing countries.,"H Haak, H V Hogerzeil","Since the early 1980s drug ration kits have been used to improve the supply of essential drugs to rural health facilities in developing countries. This paper evaluates some of the experiences with kit systems in Angola, Bhutan, Democratic Yemen, Guinea-Conakry, Kenya, Mozambique, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia in relation to the selection of drugs for the kits and their quantities and cost. Data were collected through a review of published papers, annual reports and programme evaluations, by questionnaires among field staff and interviews with key experts. In comparing the 10 programmes, 21 drugs can be identified that are used in at least two-thirds of all kits. This list may be useful for evaluation and planning purposes. Six drugs (ORS, chloroquine and 4 antibiotics) usually account for over 60% of the cost of the kit. Careful monitoring of the price and quantities of these 6 drugs can therefore be very cost-effective. In the absence of reliable data on morbidity and drug needs in the initial phases of a kit system, the median drug quantities in kits from these 10 countries may serve as a starting point. Accumulating surpluses are sometimes perceived as a serious disadvantage of kit systems, ORS, benzylbenzoate solution and iron tablets are the three drugs that have most frequently accumulated. These drugs are relatively cheap and usually have a long shelf-life; in most programmes they have been successfully redistributed to other health facilities while the kit content was being adapted. The overall financial loss due to accumulation of surpluses is therefore limited. Most programmes have reached a stable kit content within two years.",No date available,Health policy and planning,No keywords,"Ambulatory Care Facilities, Data Collection, Developing Countries, Drug Costs, Formularies as Topic, Health Services Research, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Rural Health",No DOI available,"WHO Action Programme on Essential Drugs, Geneva, Switzerland."

It was shown that the high sample loadings seen with flash LC could also be achieved using flash SFC. The dry load injection technique greatly increases the amount of sample that can be applied to a flash SFC column while still achieving separation. Flash SFC has much lower solvent usage and higher purification productivities relative to flash LC.

Identifiable pharmacokinetic models: the role of extra inputs and measurements.,"K R Godfrey, R P Jones, R F Brown","Single input, single output experiments can result in nonunique solutions for the rate constants to a linear compartmental model used to describe the pharmacokinetics. Where a finite number of solutions exists, a priori knowledge has to be used to distinguish between the solutions. Where there is a infinite number of solutions, assumptions have to be made about the values of some rate constants in order to obtained a unique solution for the other. This paper considers such experiments and determines whether either the addition of an extra input (simultaneously with the first input) or the taking of an extra measurement would result in a unique solution. It is found that perturbing a second input can be useful, but only if the perturbation is of different shape from the first input. Measurements of drug in urine and metabolite in plasma are generally not helpful in resolving identifiability of the drug dynamic model. If a radioactive tracer is used, through, the second measurement (for example, by externally scanning the radioactivity of the liver) can prove useful, but only if the gain of the measuring device is known.",No date available,Journal of pharmacokinetics and biopharmaceutics,No keywords,"Administration, Oral, Animals, Biotransformation, Injections, Intravenous, Kinetics, Models, Biological, Pharmaceutical Preparations",No DOI available,
Evaluation of a polysaccharide-based chiral reversed-phase liquid chromatography screen strategy in pharmaceutical analysis.,"Ziqing Lin, Hua-Chia Tai, Guanghui Zhu, Abigail Fabiano, Amaris Borges-Muñoz, Yun K Ye, Brian Lingfeng He","Chirality control plays a critical role in developing stereoisomeric drugs. Due to the complexity and lack of predictability in chiral separations, column screening remains the gold standard to initiate chiral method development for active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and synthetic intermediates. Chiral reversed-phase (RP) liquid chromatography (LC) has gained favor over other modes due to its versatility and compatibility in analyzing a wide range of chiral compounds in various matrices. Herein, we established a tier-based chiral RPLC screen strategy by constructing and analyzing a database of 101 chiral screens with a total of 3,401 entries (unique LC runs) for proprietary APIs or intermediates at Bristol Myers Squibb. Up to 17 polysaccharide-based chiral stationary phases (CSPs) and four mobile phases (MPs) have been screened with gradient elution. A selection of ten CSPs with two MPs was found sufficient to achieve successful separation for 82% of the total screens. Two RPLC screen tiers (Tier 1: AZ, OD, ID, and IG) and (Tier 2: AY, OJ, OZ, IA, IC, and IH) were proposed along with two MPs (acidic and neutral) to target ~70% hit rate for Tier 1, and ~80% for the combined set.

A novel robust hydrogel-assisted paper-based sensor based on fluorescence UiO-66-NH<sub>2</sub>@ZIF-8 for the dual-channel detection of captopril.,"Nan Wang, Zhengxuan Li, Yihan Zhao, Xushuo Wu, Chenyu Zhou, Xingguang Su","Captopril (CP) is commonly used as an active enzyme inhibitor for the treatment of coronary heart disease, hypertension and angina pectoris. The development of sensitive and efficient method for CP analysis is of great importance in biomedical research. Herein, we fabricated a sensitive and robust hydrogel-assisted paper-based sensor based on fluorescence UiO-66-NH<sub>2</sub>@ZIF-8 and Co, N-doped carbon nanozymes with oxidase-mimicking activity for accurate monitoring of captopril. The hydrogel-assisted paper-based sensor appeared a visible pink signal due to the catalytic oxidation of colorless N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine (DPD) to oxDPD by Co, N-doped carbon-based nanozymes, and resulted in the fluorescence quenching of UiO-66-NH<sub>2</sub>@ZIF-8. In the presence of captopril, the oxidation of chromogenic substrate DPD by Co, N-doped nanozymes in the hydrogel-assisted paper-based sensor was hindered and accompanied by a change in the visible color, leading to recovery of the fluorescence of UiO-66-NH<sub>2</sub>@ZIF-8, and the change in the fluorescence color could also be observed. Therefore, the quantitative detection of captopril is achieved by taking a smartphone photograph and converting the image parameters into data information using ImageJ software. The portable hydrogel-assisted paper sensor provided sensitive detection of captopril in two modes based on visible color change as well as fluorescence color change with limits of detection of 0.45 μM and 0.47 μM, respectively.

What Can Electrochemical Methods Offer in Determining DNA-Drug Interactions?,"Sandra Ramotowska, Aleksandra Ciesielska, Mariusz Makowski","The interactions of compounds with DNA have been studied since the recognition of the role of nucleic acid in organisms. The design of molecules which specifically interact with DNA sequences allows for the control of the gene expression. Determining the type and strength of such interaction is an indispensable element of pharmaceutical studies. Cognition of the therapeutic action mechanisms is particularly important for designing new drugs. Owing to their sensitivity, simplicity, and low costs, electrochemical methods are increasingly used for this type of research. Compared to other techniques, they require a small number of samples and are characterized by a high reliability. These methods can provide information about the type of interaction and the binding strength, as well as the damage caused by biologically active molecules targeting the cellular DNA.

Methodology to estimate the break force of pharmaceutical tablets with curved faces under diametrical compression.,"M Al-Sabbagh, P Polak, R J Roberts, G K Reynolds, I C Sinka","This paper develops a methodology to estimate the break force of curved faced tablets under diametrical compression. Common excipients used in pharmaceutical tablet formulations, including microcrystalline cellulose, calcium phosphate and mannitol as well as their mixtures were characterised. Compacts of different densities were manufactured and their compressive and tensile strength was measured. The break force of curved face tablets having a comprehensive range of face curvatures and thickness was measured using the diametrical compression method (""hardness"" test). Equation σ<sub>d</sub>=FπD<sup>2</sup>atD+bWD<sup>-1</sup> introduced by Shang et al.

Prediction of passive blood-brain partitioning: straightforward and effective classification models based on in silico derived physicochemical descriptors.,"Santiago Vilar, Mayukh Chakrabarti, Stefano Costanzi","The distribution of compounds between blood and brain is a very important consideration for new candidate drug molecules. In this paper, we describe the derivation of two linear discriminant analysis (LDA) models for the prediction of passive blood-brain partitioning, expressed in terms of logBB values. The models are based on computationally derived physicochemical descriptors, namely the octanol/water partition coefficient (logP), the topological polar surface area (TPSA) and the total number of acidic and basic atoms, and were obtained using a homogeneous training set of 307 compounds, for all of which the published experimental logBB data had been determined in vivo. In particular, since molecules with logBB>0.3 cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) readily while molecules with logBB<-1 are poorly distributed to the brain, on the basis of these thresholds we derived two distinct models, both of which show a percentage of good classification of about 80%. Notably, the predictive power of our models was confirmed by the analysis of a large external dataset of compounds with reported activity on the central nervous system (CNS) or lack thereof. The calculation of straightforward physicochemical descriptors is the only requirement for the prediction of the logBB of novel compounds through our models, which can be conveniently applied in conjunction with drug design and virtual screenings.",2010,Journal of molecular graphics & modelling,No keywords,"Blood-Brain Barrier, Drug Design, Humans, Models, Molecular, Pharmaceutical Preparations, ROC Curve, Reproducibility of Results, Structure-Activity Relationship",10.1016/j.jmgm.2010.03.010,"Laboratory of Biological Modeling, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, DHHS, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."

Kinetics of finite dose absorption through skin 2: volatile compounds.,"Gerald B Kasting, Matthew A Miller","A diffusion model to account for the disposition of an arbitrary dose of a (potentially) volatile compound applied to skin from a volatile vehicle is presented. In its most general form, the model allows for variable diffusivity of the permeant in the stratum corneum (SC) and must be solved numerically. However, for permeants having a constant diffusivity, absorption, and evaporation is characterized in terms of four dimensionless parameters-a reduced time tau, a fractional deposition depth in the SC f, a ratio of membrane capacity for the permeant to the applied dose beta, and a ratio of evaporative mass transfer coefficient to diffusive permeability chi. An important combination of these parameters arises as the reduced dose M(r) = (fbeta)(-1). Two cases are distinguished. In Case 1, corresponding to M(r) < or = 1, the dose is less than that required to saturate the upper layers of the SC, and the shape of the absorption and evaporation profiles is independent of the dose. Analytical solutions to Case 1 may be derived for arbitrary initial distributions of the permeant; the solution for a square wave is presented. In Case 2, corresponding to M(r) > 1, absorption and evaporation approach steady-state values as the dose is increased. Numerical evaluations of this behavior are shown. Limiting behavior for the case of a highly volatile solvent applied to skin is discussed.

"Nail disorders in older people, and aspects of their pharmaceutical treatment.",Sudaxshina Murdan,"The aim of this paper was to explore how aging influences the nail unit, its disorders and its response to treatment, and to identify some of the age-related gaps in the ungual drug delivery literature. Aging causes obvious changes to the nail, some of which are inherently due to old age, while others are due to diseases/conditions which become more prevalent as we age. Alterations in the nail plate's colour, contour, thickness, fragility, surface features, cell size, chemical composition and growth rate are some of the changes, with toenails and fingernails showing different effects. With respect to disease, the incidence of onychomycosis - the most common nail disorder - is considerably higher in older people. Similarly, brittle nails become more common as we age. In contrast, the literature about aging and the incidence of nail psoriasis is inconclusive, although, it is clear that as one gets older, the negative impact of nail psoriasis on one's quality of life decreases. Pharmaceutical treatment of the diseases comprises local and systemic therapies, sometimes in combination. Systemic therapies have the inherent disadvantages of adverse systemic effects, drug interactions and the need for monitoring, disadvantages which are especially problematic for older people who are more likely to suffer from co-morbidities and be on other medications. Topical therapy avoids such disadvantages. However, the success rates of commercially available preparations are low, and older people may need help with their application.

In literature the breakage of granules is mostly determined after single impact at an ideally formed granule or of single particles. In this paper the breakage behavior of agglomerates after milling with multiple impacts has been studied. It investigates the effects of the formulation and the influences of the mill settings. With respect to the formulation it has been found that both the size of the particles before granulation and the amount of binder used determine the breakage behavior. Both parameters have an influence on the strength of the granule to be milled, where initial particle size has the largest effect. A relation has been found between the strength of granules and the degree of size reduction. Regarding the mill settings, there are no mill parameters which influence the formation of fines independently. Formation of fines is always the result of the total degree of size reduction. It is not possible to achieve a large degree of size reduction without intensive fines formation. The results indicate that it is possible to achieve every desired average particle size.

They are used as the reaction media in the preparation of DDSs and as vehicles for delivery of problematic drugs. The number of pharmaceutically acceptable solvents is limited and developing new green ones is of a great of interest. A deep eutectic solvent (DES) is a room temperature liquid composed of a mixture of hydrogen bond acceptor and hydrogen bond donor. DESs exhibit interesting physical and chemical characteristics such as low vapor pressure, non-inflammability, chemically tailorable, solvency power for a wide range of solutes, and water non-reactivity. Furthermore, they can be easily prepared from low toxicity, readily available, and inexpensive constituents. Due to these properties, DESs have attracted growing attention as green solvents in different areas of science from chemistry to material engineering and biology. In this review, after a brief introduction about DESs, we provide an overview about current advances made over the last decade in utilizing of DESs for solubilization of water insoluble drugs, transdermal drug delivery, inorganic nanoparticle synthesis, and designing polymeric and self-assembled drug carriers.

Mesoporous systems for poorly soluble drugs - recent trends.,"Joakim Riikonen, Wujun Xu, Vesa-Pekka Lehto","When poor aqueous solubility of active pharmaceutical ingredients is encountered during a drug formulation process, the toolbox typically utilized contains pharmaceutical salts, co-crystals, solid dispersions, cyclodextrins, lipids, liposomes and nanocrystals etc. Especially in the pharmaceutical industry, the option which confers the greatest benefit with the lowest risk is usually chosen. Several factors affect the final decision, but new technologies should also be considered especially if they can address several issues at the same time. Mesoporous inorganic systems are emerging technologies which can be utilized for improving the dissolution of poorly soluble drugs. The number of the scientific papers in this field is steadily increasing and the focus of the studies is moving away from in vitro to in vivo experiments with the first human trial already completed. Meanwhile, several start-up companies focusing on mesoporous carriers have been established.

Combining surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and paper spray mass spectrometry (PS-MS) for illicit drug detection.,"Sevde Dogruer Erkok, Roxanne Gallois, Leon Leegwater, Pascal Camoiras Gonzalez, Arian van Asten, Bruce McCord","There is an ongoing effort in the US illicit drug market to make new psychoactive compounds more potent and addictive. Due to continuous chemical modifications, many fentanyl analogs are developed and mixed with more traditional illicit drugs, such as cocaine and heroin. Detecting fentanyl and fentanyl analogs in these illicit drug mixtures has become more crucial because of the increased potency and associated health risks. Most confirmatory procedures require time-consuming and expensive, highly sophisticated laboratory equipment and experimental procedures, which can delay critical information that might save a victim or find a suspect. In this study, we propose miniaturizing and accelerating this process by combining surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) analysis and paper spray mass spectrometry (PS-MS). For this aim, dual-purposed paper substrates were developed through soaking in Au/Ag nanostars suspensions. These novel, in-house prepared paper SERS substrates showed stability for up to four weeks with and without the presence of drug compounds. Fentanyl analogs with similar SERS spectra were differentiated by coupling with PS-MS. The limit of detection (LOD) for fentanyl on the paper substrates is 34 μg/mL and 0.32 μg/mL for SERS and PS-MS, respectively. Fentanyl and fentanyl analogs show selective SERS enhancement that helped to detect trace amounts of these opioids in heroin and cocaine street samples. In short, we propose the combination of SERS/PS-MS by using modified paper substrates to develop cost-effective, sensitive, rapid, portable, reliable, and reproducible methods to detect illicit drugs, especially trace amounts of fentanyl and fentanyl analogs in illicit drug mixtures. The combination of these two category A techniques allows for the identification of illicit drugs according to the SWGDRUG guidelines.",2024,Talanta,"Fentanyl, Fentanyl analogs, Forensic science, Illicit drug analysis, PS-MS, SERS","Spectrum Analysis, Raman, Paper, Illicit Drugs, Fentanyl, Mass Spectrometry, Gold, Silver, Substance Abuse Detection, Limit of Detection, Metal Nanoparticles, Humans, Surface Properties",10.1016/j.talanta.2024.126414,"Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA., Department of Chemistry, L'Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon and Claude Bernard University, Lyon, France., Van 't Hoff Institute for Molecular Sciences, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands., Van 't Hoff Institute for Molecular Sciences, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands., Van 't Hoff Institute for Molecular Sciences, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands; CLHC, Amsterdam Center for Forensic Science and Medicine, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands., Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA.

Greedy and Linear Ensembles of Machine Learning Methods Outperform Single Approaches for QSPR Regression Problems.,"William Kew, John B O Mitchell","The application of Machine Learning to cheminformatics is a large and active field of research, but there exist few papers which discuss whether ensembles of different Machine Learning methods can improve upon the performance of their component methodologies. Here we investigated a variety of methods, including kernel-based, tree, linear, neural networks, and both greedy and linear ensemble methods. These were all tested against a standardised methodology for regression with data relevant to the pharmaceutical development process. This investigation focused on QSPR problems within drug-like chemical space. We aimed to investigate which methods perform best, and how the 'wisdom of crowds' principle can be applied to ensemble predictors. It was found that no single method performs best for all problems, but that a dynamic, well-structured ensemble predictor would perform very well across the board, usually providing an improvement in performance over the best single method. Its use of weighting factors allows the greedy ensemble to acquire a bigger contribution from the better performing models, and this helps the greedy ensemble generally to outperform the simpler linear ensemble.

The concept is built on the solubility-permeability interplay and the rate of supersaturation as the driving force of absorption. This paper presents the first case study using the ADDF concept where not only dissolution and solubility but also permeation of the drug is considered in every step of the formulation development. For that reason, parallel artificial membrane permeability assay (PAMPA) was used for excipient selection, small volume dissolution-permeation apparatus was used for testing amorphous solid dispersions (ASDs), and large volume dissolution-permeation tests were carried out to characterize the final dosage forms. The API-excipient interaction studies on PAMPA indicated differences when different fillers or surfactants were studied. These differences were then confirmed with small volume dissolution-permeation assays where the addition of Tween 80 to the ASDs decreased the flux dramatically. Also, the early indication of sorbitol's advantage over mannitol by PAMPA has been confirmed in the investigation of the final dosage forms by large-scale dissolution-permeation tests. This difference between the fillers was observed in vivo as well.

Dual-acting of Hybrid Compounds - A New Dawn in the Discovery of Multi-target Drugs: Lead Generation Approaches.,"Azizeh Abdolmaleki, Jahan B Ghasemi","Finding high quality beginning compounds is a critical job at the start of the lead generation stage for multi-target drug discovery (MTDD). Designing hybrid compounds as selective multitarget chemical entity is a challenge, opportunity, and new idea to better act against specific multiple targets. One hybrid molecule is formed by two (or more) pharmacophore group's participation. So, these new compounds often exhibit two or more activities going about as multi-target drugs (mtdrugs) and may have superior safety or efficacy. Application of integrating a range of information and sophisticated new in silico, bioinformatics, structural biology, pharmacogenomics methods may be useful to discover/design, and synthesis of the new hybrid molecules. In this regard, many rational and screening approaches have followed by medicinal chemists for the lead generation in MTDD. Here, we review some popular lead generation approaches that have been used for designing multiple ligands (DMLs). This paper focuses on dual- acting chemical entities that incorporate a part of two drugs or bioactive compounds to compose hybrid molecules. Also, it presents some of key concepts and limitations/strengths of lead generation methods by comparing combination framework method with screening approaches.

Interactions between active pharmaceutical ingredients and excipients affecting bioavailability: impact on bioequivalence.,Alfredo García-Arieta,"The aim of the present paper is to illustrate the impact that excipients may have on the bioavailability of drugs and to review existing US-FDA, WHO and EMA regulatory guidelines on this topic. The first examples illustrate that small amounts of sorbitol (7, 50 or 60mg) affect the bioavailability of risperidone, a class I drug, oral solution, in contrast to what is stated in the US-FDA guidance. Another example suggests, in contrast to what is stated in the US-FDA BCS biowaivers guideline, that a small amount of sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) (3.64mg) affects the bioavailability of risperidone tablets, although the reference product also includes SLS in an amount within the normal range for that type of dosage form. These factors are considered sufficient to ensure that excipients do not affect bioavailability according to the WHO guideline. The alternative criterion, defined in the WHO guideline and used in the FIP BCS biowaivers monographs, that asserts that excipients present in generic products of the ICH countries do not affect bioavailability if used in normal amounts, is shown to be incorrect with an example of alendronate (a class III drug) tablets, where 4mg of SLS increases bioavailability more than 5-fold, although a generic product in the USA contains SLS. Finally, another example illustrates that a 2mg difference in SLS may affect bioavailability of a generic product of a class II drug, even if SLS is contained in the comparator product, and in all cases its amount was within the normal range. Therefore, waivers of in vivo bioequivalence studies (e.g., BCS biowaivers, waivers of certain dosage forms in solution at the time of administration and variations in the excipient composition) should be assessed more cautiously.",2014,European journal of pharmaceutical sciences : official journal of the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences,"Bioavailability, Biowaivers, Drug–excipient interaction, Excipient, Regulatory requirements","Administration, Oral, Biological Availability, Biopharmaceutics, Excipients, Humans, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Tablets, Therapeutic Equivalency",10.1016/j.ejps.2014.09.004,"Head of Service on Pharmacokinetics and Generics, Division of Pharmacology and Clinical Evaluation, Department of Human Use Medicines, Spanish Agency for Medicines and Health Care Products, Madrid, Spain.

As observed, improved separation of tested drug enantiomers was obtained with the presence of chiral ILs compared to the conventional β-cyclodextrin derivatives separation system. Parameters such as type and proportion of organic modifier, type and concentration of chiral ILs, concentration of chiral selector, buffer pH and applied voltage were systematically investigated with Me-β-CD/chiral ILs as model system to optimize the novel synergistic system, and the best results were obtained when 15 mM chiral ILs were introduced into the 30 mM sodium citrate/citric acid (20% organic modifier included) buffer solution containing 20 mM Me-β-CD at pH 5.0 with a 20 kV applied voltage for naproxen, pranoprofen and warfarin.",2013,Journal of chromatography.

Enantiomers separation by capillary electrochromatography using polysaccharide-based stationary phases.,"Giovanni D' Orazio, María Asensio-Ramos, Chiara Fanali","The separation of chiral compounds is an interesting and important topic of research because these compounds are involved in some biological processes, fundamentally in human health. Among the various application fields where enantiomers are remarkable, drug analysis has to be considered. Most of the drugs contain enantiomers and very often one of the two isomers could be pharmacologically more active or even dangerous. Therefore, the separation of these compounds is very important. Among the different analytical techniques usually employed, capillary electrochromatography has demonstrated great capability in enantiomers resolution. The great potential of this electromigration technique stands mainly in its high efficiency due to the use of an electrosmotic flow (flat flow profile) and on the high selectivity because of the use of a stationary phase. Chiral separation can be obtained utilizing several chiral stationary phases including a polysaccharide derivative.

There is, however, a distinct lack of evidence-based guidance for healthcare providers on how to choose an appropriate inhaler. This review aims to summarise recent updates on topics related to inhaler choice, and to offer practical considerations for healthcare providers regarding currently marketed devices. The importance of choosing the right inhaler for the right patient is discussed, and the relative merits of dry powder inhalers, pressurised metered dose inhalers, breath-actuated pressurised metered dose inhalers, spacers and soft mist inhalers are considered. Compiling the latest studies in the devices therapy area, this review focuses on the most common types of handling errors, as well as the comparative rates of incorrect inhalation technique between devices.

In this study, Schirmer paper was used for noninvasive microsampling of human tears, and then paper spray mass spectrometry (PSMS) was performed for direct analysis of human tears. Schirmer PSMS was successfully used for rapid diagnosis of dry-eye syndrome by detecting the volume and metabolites of human tears. Drugs of abuse, therapeutic drugs, and pharmacodynamics in human tears were also investigated by Schirmer PSMS. Furthermore, specific markers of environmental exposures in the air to human eyes, including volatile organic compounds, aerosol, and smoke, were unambiguously sampled and detected in human tears using Schirmer PSMS. Excellent analytical performances were achieved, including single-use, low-sample consumption (1.0 μL), rapid analysis (the whole analytical procedure completed within 3 min), high sensitivity (absolute limit of detection less than or equal to 0.5 pg, signal-to-noise ratio greater than or equal to 3), good reproducibility (relative standard deviation less than 10%, <i>n</i> = 3), and accurate quantitation (average deviation less than 3%, <i>n</i> = 3).

The use of differential scanning calorimetry for the purity verification of pharmaceutical reference standards.,"S Mathkar, S Kumar, A Bystol, K Olawoore, D Min, R Markovich, A Rustum","Reference standards are routinely used in pharmaceutical industry to determine strength, content, and the quality of drug products, active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), preservatives, antioxidants and excipients. Traditionally, chromatographic techniques such as High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and Gas Chromatography (GC) in conjunction with other analytical techniques have been used to determine the purity and strength of a specific lot of a compound for the purpose of qualifying the lot to use as a reference standard. The assigned purity of the reference standard for a wide variety of compounds can be verified using an absolute method such as Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). In this paper, purity of 16 reference standards was determined by DSC and the results were then compared to the purity values that were obtained using HPLC and other analytical techniques. The results indicate that the purity obtained from DSC analysis is comparable to the chromatographic purity for organic compounds that are at least 98% pure. Use of DSC for purity determination is not appropriate if a compound lacks sharp melting point, decomposes in the defined temperature range or exhibits other thermal event(s) which interfere with the melting point of the compound. The use of DSC as an alternative and or complementary method to verify the purity of a compound as part of the pharmaceutical reference standard certification process is discussed.",2008,Journal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis,No keywords,"Calorimetry, Differential Scanning, Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid, Indicators and Reagents, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Reference Standards, Thermogravimetry",10.1016/j.jpba.2008.12.030,"Global Quality Services-Analytical Sciences, Schering-Plough Corporation, 1011 Morris Avenue, Union, NJ 07083, USA."
Quantitation of parent drug and its unstable metabolites by in situ coulometric oxidation and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.,"Wei Tong, Swapan K Chowdhury, Ai-Duen Su, Kevin B Alton","Recent FDA and ICH guidances on safety testing of drug metabolites have challenged the way we traditionally think about quantitative bioanalytical methods. Such assays, in general, require a reference standard for each analyte to construct calibration curves and prepare quality control samples. However, early in the drug development process, metabolite standards may not be readily available, and if they are inherently unstable, they are difficult to synthesize or purify. In this paper, we describe a novel in-line method for producing and then quantifying a very unstable metabolite which is based upon the in situ postcolumn coulometric oxidation of the parent drug. Lacking any metabolite standards, the feasibility of simultaneously quantifying a development drug (compound A) and its unstable hydroxylated metabolites (metabolite B) was investigated. Reference standards for these ostensibly major human metabolites could not be reliably obtained due to rapid degradation upon purification and/or subsequent storage. Following high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation, parent drug and its [(13)C(3)-(15)N] isotopically labeled internal standard were quantitatively converted to equal amounts of a diastereomeric pair of hydroxylated metabolites using a postcolumn coulometric electrochemical cell before reaching the mass spectrometer. The concentration of the injected parent (which is equal to the total concentration of the in-line generated metabolites since the conversion to metabolite is quantitative) and the tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) signals of the electrochemically generated metabolites were used to construct a calibration curve for quantifying both the parent drug and its hydroxylated metabolites. Plasma extracts from humans dosed with compound A contained chromatographically distinct liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) signals (m/z 538) for in vivo formed hydroxylated metabolites and the electrochemically oxidized parent drug which had been converted in-line into its chemically identical twin. Both peaks in this study sample could be quantified using a single calibration curve obtained under the same coulometric conditions using known amounts of the parent drug. Although no attempt was made to fully validate a bioanalytical method, the practicality of this in situ quantification approach was further confirmed by the preliminary bioanalytical analysis of a selection of plasma samples collected following oral administration (50 mg) of compound A in a clinical study.",2010,Analytical chemistry,No keywords,"Carbon Isotopes, Chromatography, Liquid, Humans, Hydroxylation, Nitrogen Isotopes, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Tandem Mass Spectrometry",10.1021/ac102538s,"Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics, Merck Research Laboratories, 2015 Galloping Hill Road, Kenilworth, New Jersey 07033, United States. wei.tong@merck.com"
Age and sex differences in pharmaceutical contamination in a keystone scavenger.,"Guillermo Blanco, Martina Carrete, Isabel Navas, Antonio J García-Fernández","Pharmaceutical contaminants have a recognized negative impact on wildlife health. However, there are still many knowledge gaps on the factors influencing exposure and metabolic processing of compound mixtures as a function of season and individual characteristics such as age and sex. We evaluated age and sex differences in a set of seventeen compounds, including eleven antibiotics, five NSAIDs and caffeine, evaluated by HPLC-MS-TOF analysis in griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus) from central Spain. Pharmaceutical cocktails (up to 10 compounds simultaneously) were found in all individuals. Lincomycin was detected in all individuals, and fluoroquinolones were found at high frequencies, while NSAIDs were at low frequencies and concentrations, including flumixin meglumine, which can be lethal to vultures. A higher total number of compounds and sum of concentrations, as well as prevalence and concentration of several of the pharmaceuticals tested was found in females than in males for both nestlings and adults. This is the first study to present evidence of sex differences in the pharmacokinetics of dietary drug contaminants in a vulture species. Chronic exposure to ""medications"" in entire populations can potentially have sub-lethal health effects that affect fitness differently according to age and sex, with demographic implications for population viability.

In this paper, we evaluate and compare various methods for measuring identity, purity, and quantity (yield) of combinatorial libraries. Determination of quantitative purity reveals the true library quality and often indicates potential quality problems before full-scale library production. The relative purity can be determined for every member in a large library in a high-throughput mode, but must be cautiously interpreted. In particular, many impurities are not observable by relative purity measurements using detectors such as UV(214), UV(254), and evaporative light-scattering detection. These ""invisible"" impurities may constitute a significant portion of the sample weight. We found that TFA, plastic extracts, inorganic compounds, and resin washout are among these impurities.

Robust identification of significant interactions between toxicogenomic biomarkers and their regulatory chemical compounds using logistic moving range chart.,"Mohammad Nazmol Hasan, Anjuman Ara Begum, Moizur Rahman, Md Nurul Haque Mollah","Identification of significant interactions between genes and chemical compounds/drugs is an important issue in toxicogenomic studies as well as in drug discovery and development. There are some online and offline computational tools for toxicogenomic data analysis to identify the biomarker genes and their regulatory chemical compounds/drugs. However, none of the researchers has considered yet the identification of significant interactions between genes and compounds. Therefore, in this paper, we have discussed two approaches namely moving range chart (MRC) and logistic moving range chart (LMRC) for the identification of significant up-regulatory (UpR) and down-regulatory (DnR) gene-compound interactions as well as toxicogenomic biomarkers and their regulatory chemical compounds/drugs. We have investigated the performance of both MRC and LMRC approaches using simulated datasets. Simulation results show that both approaches perform almost equally in absence of outliers. However, in presence of outliers, the LMRC shows much better performance than the MRC.

On the positive side, transdermal drug delivery systems present advantages including non-invasiveness, prolonged therapeutic effect, reduced side effects, improved bioavailability, better patient compliance and easy termination of drug therapy. The greatest hindrance in the percutaneous delivery is the obstruction property of the stratum corneum, the outermost layer of the skin, in addition to usual problems such as skin binding, skin metabolism, cutaneous toxicity and prolonged lag times.",No date available,Expert opinion on therapeutic patents,No keywords,"Administration, Cutaneous, Animals, Chemistry, Pharmaceutical, Drug Delivery Systems, Excipients, Humans, Patents as Topic, Permeability, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Skin, Skin Absorption",10.1517/13543770902989983,"Faculty of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmaceutics, Hamdard University, New Delhi, India."
Analysis of basic compounds by supercritical fluid chromatography: attempts to improve peak shape and maintain mass spectrometry compatibility.,"Alexandre Grand-Guillaume Perrenoud, Julien Boccard, Jean-Luc Veuthey, Davy Guillarme","While neutral and acidic compounds are well separated by supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC), basic analytes are more challenging to separate and often problems occur with their peak shapes. Two different methods were explored in the present paper to reduce these problems and maintain compatibility with mass spectrometry (MS). Five different, commercially available 2-ethylpyridine (2-EP) stationary phases were tested without a mobile phase additive using 92 pharmaceutical compounds with basic properties. The kinetic performances of the 5 columns were nearly identical, but the peak shapes of the basic drugs were strongly affected by the stationary phase. The PrincetonSFC 2-EP and Zymor Pegasus 2-EP phases clearly outperformed the other stationary phases, with 77% and 69% of the compounds having Gaussian peaks (and asymmetries between 0.8 and 1.4), respectively. Comparatively, the Waters Viridis Silica 2-EP, Waters Viridis BEH 2-EP and ES industries GreenSep 2-EP phases provided only 52%, 44% and 22% of the compounds with Gaussian peaks, respectively. These differences were attributed to the significant dissimilarities in their silica matrix properties. An alternative strategy was also performed with a hybrid silica stationary phase, Viridis BEH, using 20mM ammonium hydroxide in the mobile phase, which was a mixture of CO(2) and MeOH. With these conditions, 81% of the peaks observed for the basic analytes were Gaussian; however, this value dropped to 17% and 10% in the absence of additive and in the presence of 20mM formic acid, respectively. Finally, the use of a hybrid bare silica stationary phase in the presence of 20mM ammonium hydroxide is quite an interesting solution as this system is compatible with both ultra high performance SFC (UHPSFC) columns packed with sub-2 μm particles and with MS detection. The overall applicability of this system was demonstrated with various mixtures of basic drugs.",2012,Journal of chromatography.

Automatic flow delay through passive wax valves for paper-based analytical devices.,"Haixu Meng, Chang Chen, Yonggang Zhu, Zhengtu Li, Feng Ye, Joshua W K Ho, Huaying Chen","Microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (μPADs) have been widely explored for point-of-care testing due to their simplicity, low cost, and portability. μPADs with multiple-step reactions usually require precise flow control, especially flow-delay. This paper reports the numerical, mathematical, and experimental studies of flow delay through wax valves surrounded by PDMS walls on paper microfluidics. The predried surfactant in the sample zone diffuses into the liquid sample which can therefore flow through the wax valves. The delay time is automatically regulated by the diffusion of the surfactant after sample loading. The numerical study suggested that both the elevated contact angle and the reduced porosity and pore size in the wax printed region could effectively prevent water but allow liquids with lower contact angles (<i>e.g.</i>, surfactant solutions) to flow through. The PDMS walls fabricated using a low-cost liquid dispenser effectively prevented the leakage of surfactant solutions. By controlling the quantity, diffusion distance, and type of the surfactant predried on the chip, the system successfully achieved a delay time ranging from 1.6 to 20 minutes. A mathematical model involving the above parameters was developed based on Fick's second law to predict the delay time. Finally, the flow-delay systems were applied in sequential mixing and distance-based detection of either glucose or alcohol. Linear ranges of 1-100 mg dL<sup>-1</sup> and 1-40 mg dL<sup>-1</sup> were achieved for glucose and alcohol, respectively. The lower limit detection (LOD) of glucose and alcohol was 1 mg dL<sup>-1</sup>. The LOD of glucose was only 1/11 of that detected using μPADs without flow control, indicating the advantage of controlling fluid flow. The systematic findings in this study provide critical guidelines for the development and applications of wax valves in automatic flow delay for point-of-care testing.",2021,Lab on a chip,No keywords,"Glucose, Lab-On-A-Chip Devices, Microfluidic Analytical Techniques, Microfluidics, Paper, Point-of-Care Testing",10.1039/d1lc00638j,"School of Mechanical Engineering and Automation, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518055, China. chenhuaying@hit.edu.cn., School of Mechanical Engineering and Automation, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518055, China. chenhuaying@hit.edu.cn., School of Mechanical Engineering and Automation, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518055, China. chenhuaying@hit.edu.cn., State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, National Clinical Centre of Respiratory Disease, The First Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510120, China., State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, National Clinical Centre of Respiratory Disease, The First Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510120, China., School of Biomedical Sciences, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China., School of Mechanical Engineering and Automation, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518055, China. chenhuaying@hit.edu.cn."
Modeling Physico-Chemical ADMET Endpoints with Multitask Graph Convolutional Networks.,"Floriane Montanari, Lara Kuhnke, Antonius Ter Laak, Djork-Arné Clevert","Simple physico-chemical properties, like logD, solubility, or melting point, can reveal a great deal about how a compound under development might later behave. These data are typically measured for most compounds in drug discovery projects in a medium throughput fashion. Collecting and assembling all the Bayer in-house data related to these properties allowed us to apply powerful machine learning techniques to predict the outcome of those assays for new compounds. In this paper, we report our finding that, especially for predicting physicochemical ADMET endpoints, a multitask graph convolutional approach appears a highly competitive choice. For seven endpoints of interest, we compared the performance of that approach to fully connected neural networks and different single task models. The new model shows increased predictive performance compared to previous modeling methods and will allow early prioritization of compounds even before they are synthesized.

Improvement of microemulsion electrokinetic chromatography for measuring octanol-water partition coefficients.,"Zhining Xia, Xuemei Jiang, Xiaojing Mu, Hua Chen","Microemulsion electrokinetic chromatography (MEEKC) has been used to indirectly measure octanol-water partition coefficients (log P(ow)) of compounds. In order to obtain an accurate log P(ow) value, the electrophoretic mobilities of the microemulsion phase (mu(me)) and the analyte (mu(eff)) in MEEKC must be accurately required. However, in conventional MEEKC, the shortage of obtaining mu(me) with a tracing method was discovered, and the influences of concentration, injection volume of analyte, and high electric field on measuring mu(eff) were also found. In this paper, a novel method called improved MEEKC (I-MEEKC) was developed to avoid the problems mentioned above. In I-MEEKC, a nonlinearity fitting program was used to obtain mu(me) to avoid the error from tracing mu(me); the extrapolating method was used to eliminate the effects of concentrations and injection volumes of analytes on mu(eff) measurement, and an enough stable microemulsion was selected to eliminate the effect of high electric field on mu(eff )measurement. Then the novel method was applied to estimate log P(ow) of uncharged compounds and charged pharmaceuticals compared to the conventional MEEKC. The log P(ow) of all analytes obtained by I-MEEKC agreed with those obtained by classical shake flask or literature values, the errors between them were within 0.1 logarithm units, better than the ones by conventional MEEKC.",No date available,Electrophoresis,No keywords,"Chromatography, Micellar Electrokinetic Capillary, Emulsions, Octanols, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Water",10.1002/elps.200700104,"Department of Pharmaceutics, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing, P.

An integrated lateral flow assay for effective DNA amplification and detection at the point of care.,"Jane Ru Choi, Jie Hu, Yan Gong, Shangsheng Feng, Wan Abu Bakar Wan Abas, Belinda Pingguan-Murphy, Feng Xu","Lateral flow assays (LFAs) have been extensively explored in nucleic acid testing (NAT) for medical diagnostics, food safety analysis and environmental monitoring. However, the amount of target nucleic acid in a raw sample is usually too low to be directly detected by LFAs, necessitating the process of amplification. Even though cost-effective paper-based amplification techniques have been introduced, they have always been separately performed from LFAs, hence increasing the risk of reagent loss and cross-contaminations. To date, integrating paper-based nucleic acid amplification into colorimetric LFA in a simple, portable and cost-effective manner has not been introduced. Herein, we developed an integrated LFA with the aid of a specially designed handheld battery-powered system for effective amplification and detection of targets in resource-poor settings. Interestingly, using the integrated paper-based loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP)-LFA, we successfully performed highly sensitive and specific target detection, achieving a detection limit of as low as 3 × 10(3) copies of target DNA, which is comparable to the conventional tube-based LAMP-LFA in an unintegrated format.

Interest of achiral-achiral tandem columns for impurity profiling of synthetic drugs with supercritical fluid chromatography.,"Caroline West, Elise Lemasson, Sophie Bertin, Philippe Hennig, Eric Lesellier","To achieve the most complete impurity profiling of synthetic drugs with a single chromatographic technique, high resolution is required, which may be gained with a combination of high efficiency and versatile selectivity, allowing to separate most similar analytes. Compared to a single-column chromatographic method, coupling complementary stationary phases promises both an increase in efficiency and an increase in selectivity possibilities. With supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC), the use of long columns is facilitated by the low viscosity of the mobile phase. In this paper, we investigate the interest of coupling two achiral stationary phases (Acquity UPC<sup>2</sup> HSS C18 SB and Nucleoshell HILIC) that were previously observed to have excellent complementarity in SFC to carry out impurity profiling on 25 individual drug substances containing varied numbers and amounts of impurities. The single-column gradient methods are compared to tandem-column gradient methods with the two possible ordering of columns (C18 phase in first or second position) based on selectivity, peak capacity, sensitivity, UV-estimated purity of the active pharmaceutical ingredient and number of impurities detected with UV-estimated concentration >0.04%. It appears that it could be more beneficial to have two columns coupled in a single analysis than two consecutive methods with the single columns. The overall analysis time are nearly the same, but with more informative chromatograms in about 35% cases.",2017,Journal of chromatography.

Identification and characterization of reactive metabolites in natural products-driven drug discovery.,"Nicholas M Njuguna, Collen Masimirembwa, Kelly Chibale","Toxicity of natural products arising from their metabolic biotransformation into reactive chemical intermediates is an important reason for high attrition rates in early drug discovery efforts. Screening promising natural products for their likelihood to form such metabolites is therefore an important step in identifying potential liabilities in the drug development process. However, such screening is complicated by the need to have test methods that are sensitive, reliable, accurate, efficient, and cost-effective enough to allow for routine identification and characterization of the reactive metabolites. These metabolites are typically formed in minute quantities, usually through minor metabolic pathways, and, due to their highly reactive and therefore transient chemical nature, pose considerable analytical challenges in attempts to determine their properties. Understanding the formation of reactive metabolites may be used as the basis for synthetic chemical modification of parent natural products aimed at bypassing such harmful bioactivation. This paper highlights the general principles and protocols commonly used to predict and study the formation of reactive metabolites in vitro and how the data obtained from such studies can be used in the development of safer drugs from natural products.",2012,Journal of natural products,No keywords,"Biological Products, Biotransformation, Drug Discovery, Humans, Molecular Structure, Pharmaceutical Preparations",10.1021/np200786j,"Department of Chemistry and Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, University of Cape Town, Rondebosch, 7701, South Africa."

Regional intestinal drug permeation: biopharmaceutics and drug development.,Hans Lennernäs,"Over the last 25 years, profound changes have been seen in both the development and regulation of pharmaceutical dosage forms, due primarily to the extensive use of the biopharmaceutical classification system (BCS) in both academia and industry. The BCS and the FDA scale-up and post-approval change guidelines were both developed during the 1990s and both are currently widely used to claim biowaivers. The development of the BCS and its wide acceptance were important steps in pharmaceutical science that contributed to the more rational development of oral dosage forms. The effective permeation (Peff) of drugs through the intestine often depends on the combined outcomes of passive diffusion and multiple parallel transport processes. Site-specific jejunal Peff cannot reflect the permeability of the whole intestinal tract, since this varies along the length of the intestine, but is a useful approximation of the fraction of the oral dose that is absorbed. It appears that drugs with a jejunal Peff>1.5×10(-4)cm/s will be completely absorbed no matter which transport mechanisms are utilized. In this paper, historical clinical data originating from earlier open, single-pass perfusion studies have been used to calculate the Peff of different substances from sites in the jejunum and ileum. More exploratory in vivo studies are required in order to obtain reliable data on regional intestinal drug absorption. The development of experimental and theoretical methods of assessing drug absorption from both small intestine and various sites in the colon is encouraged. Some of the existing human in vivo data are discussed in relation to commonly used cell culture models. It is crucial to accurately determine the input parameters, such as the regional intestinal Peff, as these will form the basis for the expected increase in modeling and simulation of all the processes involved in GI drug absorption, thus facilitating successful pharmaceutical development in the future. It is suggested that it would be feasible to use open, single-pass perfusion studies for the in vivo estimation of regional intestinal Peff, but that care should be taken in the study design to optimize the absorption conditions.",2013,European journal of pharmaceutical sciences : official journal of the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences,"Biopharmaceutical classification system, Biopharmaceutics, Dissolution, Drug absorption, IVIVC, PBPK","Administration, Oral, Biological Availability, Biopharmaceutics, Dosage Forms, Drug Discovery, Humans, Intestinal Absorption, Intestinal Mucosa, Models, Biological, Permeability, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Pharmacokinetics, Solubility",10.1016/j.ejps.2013.08.025,"Department of Pharmaceutics, Uppsala University, Sweden.

The Application of Modern Powder Characterisation Methods in Product and Process Development of Solid Dosage Forms.,"Tim Freeman, Katrina Brockbank, Brian Armstrong","The pharmaceutical industry still produces the vast majority of their products, from powdered ingredients, in the form of solid doses. Despite their ubiquity, powders are difficult materials to characterise and understand, as evidenced by the frequent problems encountered during manufacture. The reason for this is their complex rheological behaviour coupled with numerous environmental variations, such as humidity. Equally, the range of processes used to manipulate powders subject them to extremes of stress from high compaction loads seen in compactors to the dispersed state seen in fluidised bed dryers. Thus, it is evident that ensuring that the powders characteristics are compatible with the way they are to be processed is a clear prerequisite for today's Quality by Design driven manufacturing. Modern, computer controlled instrumental techniques, including the dynamic, bulk and shear property measurements have enabled direct measurements of a powders response to aeration, consolidation and flow rate - all at low stresses - as well as quantifying shear and bulk properties (such as density, compressibility and permeability).

Biomarkers are not only utilized for internal decision-making by sponsors; they are increasingly utilized to make critical decisions for drug safety and efficacy. As the regulatory agencies are routinely making decisions based on biomarker data, there has been significant scrutiny on the validation of biomarker methods. Contract research organizations regularly use commercially available immunoassay kits to validate biomarker methods. However, adaptation of such kits in a regulated environment presents significant challenges and was one of the key topics discussed during the 12th Global Contract Research Organization Council for Bioanalysis (GCC) meeting.

Exploring Tunable Hyperparameters for Deep Neural Networks with Industrial ADME Data Sets.,"Yadi Zhou, Suntara Cahya, Steven A Combs, Christos A Nicolaou, Jibo Wang, Prashant V Desai, Jie Shen","Deep learning has drawn significant attention in different areas including drug discovery. It has been proposed that it could outperform other machine learning algorithms, especially with big data sets. In the field of pharmaceutical industry, machine learning models are built to understand quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) and predict molecular activities, including absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties, using only molecular structures. Previous reports have demonstrated the advantages of using deep neural networks (DNNs) for QSAR modeling. One of the challenges while building DNN models is identifying the hyperparameters that lead to better generalization of the models. In this study, we investigated several tunable hyperparameters of deep neural network models on 24 industrial ADME data sets. We analyzed the sensitivity and influence of five different hyperparameters including the learning rate, weight decay for L2 regularization, dropout rate, activation function, and the use of batch normalization. This paper focuses on strategies and practices for DNN model building. Further, the optimized model for each data set was built and compared with the benchmark models used in production.

Extensive experiments with sets of active molecules from the MDL Drug Data Report and the World of Molecular Bioactivity databases, using fingerprints encoding Tripos holograms, Pipeline Pilot ECFC_4 circular substructures and Sunset Molecular keys, demonstrate clearly that frequency-based screening is generally more effective than conventional, unweighted screening. The results suggest that standardising the raw occurrence frequencies by taking the square root of the frequencies will maximise the effectiveness of virtual screening.

This paper presents a fluorescence imaging technique to visualise and characterise the emission of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) fines in model formulations containing coarse lactose carrier and 1.5-2 μm diameter fluorescent microspheres (model API fines). A two-camera arrangement was used to acquire simultaneous images of spatial and temporal distribution of model API fines and fluidised powder formulation near the mouthpiece exit of a DPI. Digital image analysis showed that the model API fines were released along with the bulk of the powder dose. More rapidly accelerating airflows were found to cause earlier release of API fines. The fluorescence imaging technique analyses a substantial fraction of the aerosol plume and was found to provide effective time-resolved characterisation of the de-aggregation and release of API fines with consistent results across a wide range of model API concentrations.

A semantic and syntactic text simplification tool for health content.,"Sasikiran Kandula, Dorothy Curtis, Qing Zeng-Treitler","Text simplification is a challenging NLP task and it is particularly important in the health domain as most health information requires higher reading skills than an average consumer has. This low readability of health content is largely due to the presence of unfamiliar medical terms/concepts and certain syntactic characteristics, such as excessively complex sentences. In this paper, we discuss a simplification tool that was developed to simplify health information. The tool addresses semantic difficulty by substituting difficult terms with easier synonyms or through the use of hierarchically and/or semantically related terms. The tool also simplifies long sentences by splitting them into shorter grammatical sentences. We used the tool to simplify electronic medical records and journal articles and results show that the tool simplifies both document types though by different degrees.

The most commonly identified factors were (1) API particle size: small particle sizes are known to increase risk of processing issues; (2) Drug loading in the formulation: high drug loadings allow less opportunity to mitigate poor API properties through the use of excipients. The next step was to establish linkages with process decisions by identifying publicly-available proxies for these important parameters: dose (in place of drug loading) and BCS class (in place of particle size). Poorly-soluble API were seen as more likely to have controlled (smaller) particle size than more highly soluble API. Analysis of 435 regulatory filings revealed that higher doses and more poorly-soluble API was associated with more complex processing routes. Replacing the proxy factors with the original parameters should give the opportunity to demonstrate stronger trends. This assumption was tested by accessing a dataset relating to commercial tablet products.

End-to-End Representation Learning for Chemical-Chemical Interaction Prediction.,"Sunyoung Kwon, Sungroh Yoon","Chemical-chemical interaction (CCI) plays a major role in predicting candidate drugs, toxicities, therapeutic effects, and biological functions. CCI is typically inferred from a variety of information; however, CCI has yet not been predicted using a learning-based approach. In other drug analyses, deep learning has been actively used in recent years. However, in most cases, deep learning has been used only for classification even though it has feature extraction capabilities. Thus, in this paper, we propose an end-to-end representation learning method for CCI, named DeepCCI, which includes feature extraction and a learning-based approach. Our proposed architecture is based on the Siamese network. Hidden representations are extracted from a simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES), which is a string notation representing the chemical structure using weight-shared convolutional neural networks. Subsequently, L1 element-wise distances between the two extracted hidden representations are measured. The performance of DeepCCI is compared with those of 12 fingerprint-method combinations. The proposed DeepCCI shows the best performance in most of the evaluation metrics used. In addition, DeepCCI was experimentally validated to guarantee the commutative property.

"Silver nanoparticles: Synthesis, medical applications and biosafety.","Li Xu, Yi-Yi Wang, Jie Huang, Chun-Yuan Chen, Zhen-Xing Wang, Hui Xie","Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have been one of the most attractive nanomaterials in biomedicine due to their unique physicochemical properties. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art advances of AgNPs in the synthesis methods, medical applications and biosafety of AgNPs. The synthesis methods of AgNPs include physical, chemical and biological routes. AgNPs are mainly used for antimicrobial and anticancer therapy, and also applied in the promotion of wound repair and bone healing, or as the vaccine adjuvant, anti-diabetic agent and biosensors. This review also summarizes the biological action mechanisms of AgNPs, which mainly involve the release of silver ions (Ag<sup>+</sup>), generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), destruction of membrane structure. Despite these therapeutic benefits, their biological safety problems such as potential toxicity on cells, tissue, and organs should be paid enough attention. Besides, we briefly introduce a new type of Ag particles smaller than AgNPs, silver Ångstrom (Å, 1 Å = 0.1 nm) particles (AgÅPs), which exhibit better biological activity and lower toxicity compared with AgNPs.

Variation transmission model for setting acceptance criteria in a multi-staged pharmaceutical manufacturing process.,Richard O Montes,"Pharmaceutical manufacturing processes consist of a series of stages (e.g., reaction, workup, isolation) to generate the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). Outputs at intermediate stages (in-process control) and API need to be controlled within acceptance criteria to assure final drug product quality. In this paper, two methods based on tolerance interval to derive such acceptance criteria will be evaluated. The first method is serial worst case (SWC), an industry risk minimization strategy, wherein input materials and process parameters of a stage are fixed at their worst-case settings to calculate the maximum level expected from the stage. This maximum output then becomes input to the next stage wherein process parameters are again fixed at worst-case setting. The procedure is serially repeated throughout the process until the final stage. The calculated limits using SWC can be artificially high and may not reflect the actual process performance. The second method is the variation transmission (VT) using autoregressive model, wherein variation transmitted up to a stage is estimated by accounting for the recursive structure of the errors at each stage. Computer simulations at varying extent of variation transmission and process stage variability are performed. For the scenarios tested, VT method is demonstrated to better maintain the simulated confidence level and more precisely estimate the true proportion parameter than SWC. Real data examples are also presented that corroborate the findings from the simulation. Overall, VT is recommended for setting acceptance criteria in a multi-staged pharmaceutical manufacturing process.",2011,AAPS PharmSciTech,No keywords,"Chemistry, Pharmaceutical, Computer Simulation, Models, Theoretical, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Quality Control",10.1208/s12249-011-9734-7,"Nonclinical Statistics, Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., Kenilworth, New Jersey 07033, USA. richard.montes@merck.com"
Designs of clinical swallowability assessments of solid oral dosage forms in regulatory submissions.,"Meredith R McGuire, Agm Mostofa, Jihong Shon, Mitchell Frost, Myong-Jin Kim, Karen Li","The swallowability of solid oral dosage forms (SODFs) is crucial for medication safety and adherence. Both regulatory agencies and sponsors are concerned with bringing swallowable SODFs to patients. However, no best practices are available for assessing swallowability. Therefore, we conducted a comparative analysis of clinical swallowability assessments (CSAs) for SODFs in regulatory submissions to identify current study design practices. CSAs were identified from a ""swallowability"" keyword search of a Food and Drug Administration database. Notable design trends among the 17 CSAs were not assessing swallowability as a primary endpoint (76 %); enrolling pediatric patients (76 %); administering assessments post-screening (76 %); and utilizing questionnaires (100 %). A design trend with near equal frequency (∼50 %) was single- or multiple-doses of product administration. Study subjects were the primary questionnaire respondents (82 %), usually using a Likert scale (92 %, 12/13). CSAs generally dichotomized the responses for analysis (65 %) without pre-specified threshold values (59 %). Overall, while study designs exhibited trends, methodology variations may impact swallowability measurements affecting the interpretation of results.

Development of a predictive algorithm for the efficacy of half-life extension strategies.,Patrick M Glassman,"A challenge in development of peptide and protein therapeutics is rapid elimination from the body, necessitating frequent dosing that may lead to toxicities and/or poor patient compliance. To solve this issue, there has been great investment into half-life extension of rapidly eliminated drugs using approaches such as albumin binding, fusion to albumin or Fc, or conjugation to polyethylene glycol. Despite clinical successes of half-life extension products, no clear relationship has been drawn between properties of drugs and the pharmacokinetic parameters of their half-life extended analogues. In this study, non-compartmentally derived pharmacokinetic parameters (half-life, clearance, volume of distribution) were collected for 186 half-life extended drugs and their unmodified parent molecules. Statistical testing and regression analysis was performed to evaluate relationships between pharmacokinetic parameters and a matrix of variables. Multivariate linear regression models were developed for each of the three pharmacokinetic parameters and model predictions were in good agreement with observed data with r<sup>2</sup> values for each parameter being: half-life: 0.879, clearance: 0.820, volume of distribution: 0.937.

Detection and Quantitation of Trace Fentanyl in Heroin by Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy.,"Abed Haddad, Mircea A Comanescu, Omar Green, Thomas A Kubic, John R Lombardi","The identification of fentanyl, a main culprit in opioid overdose deaths, has become critical. Whereas Raman spectroscopy is an effective tool for detecting illicit drugs, the weak intensity of Raman scattering can make it difficult to distinguish trace materials. This shortcoming is addressed by surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), which produces strong signal enhancements when target compounds are near metal nanoparticles. This work examines the use of a paper-based substrate impregnated with silver nanoparticles for the detection of trace quantities of fentanyl alone and as an adulterant in heroin. In addition, intensity ratios of diagnostic peaks associated with each substance were fitted to a Langmuir isotherm calibration model and used for the quantitative analysis of fentanyl in heroin mixtures. Linearity was observed at <6% fentanyl, a significant finding that is consistent with concentrations found in drugs seized during law enforcement efforts. In addition, swabbing with these paper-based SERS substrates facilitated the recovery of fentanyl from surfaces, showing this to be applicable for crime scene investigations. However, assessment using the calibration model proved difficult for swabbed samples.

Opening doors with ultrasound and microbubbles: Beating biological barriers to promote drug delivery.,"J Deprez, G Lajoinie, Y Engelen, S C De Smedt, I Lentacker","Apart from its clinical use in imaging, ultrasound has been thoroughly investigated as a tool to enhance drug delivery in a wide variety of applications. Therapeutic ultrasound, as such or combined with cavitating nuclei or microbubbles, has been explored to cross or permeabilize different biological barriers. This ability to access otherwise impermeable tissues in the body makes the combination of ultrasound and therapeutics very appealing to enhance drug delivery in situ. This review gives an overview of the most important biological barriers that can be tackled using ultrasound and aims to provide insight on how ultrasound has shown to improve accessibility as well as the biggest hurdles. In addition, we discuss the clinical applicability of therapeutic ultrasound with respect to the main challenges that must be addressed to enable the further progression of therapeutic ultrasound towards an effective, safe and easy-to-use treatment tailored for drug delivery in patients.",2021,Advanced drug delivery reviews,"Blood-brain barrier, Cavitation nuclei, Cellular bioeffects, Immunotherapy, Sonoporation, Tight junctions, Tumor therapy","Animals, Drug Delivery Systems, Humans, Microbubbles, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Tissue Distribution, Ultrasonography",10.1016/j.addr.2021.02.015,"Ghent Research Group on Nanomedicines, Department of Pharmaceutics, Ghent University, Ottergemsesteenweg 460, 9000 Ghent, Belgium; Cancer Research Institute Ghent (CRIG), Ghent, Belgium., Physics of Fluids Group, MESA+ Institute for Nanotechnology and Technical Medical (TechMed) Center, University of Twente, P.O.
