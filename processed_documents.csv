0,Aging as disease.,"In this paper, I will argue that ageing can be construed as disease. First, the concept of disease is discussed, where the distinction is made between two lines of thought, an objectivist and a subjectivist one. After determining the disease conception to be used throughout the argument, it is proposed that senescence could be seen as disease. Three common counterarguments are discussed, none of which appears strong enough to effectively counter the advocated view. In the third section, two potential implications of the view advocated here will be briefly touched upon. These are the quest for a cure or treatment for ageing and the general attitude towards the elderly. It is concluded that, utilizing an objective disease concept, ageing could be seen as a disease. None of the considered counterarguments packs enough of a punch to discard this. The implications are complex and intertwined, but need not be negative.",no keywords,"Medicine, Health Care, And Philosophy",paper argu age constru diseas first concept diseas discus distinct made two line thought objectivist subjectivist one determin diseas concept use throughout argument propos senesc could seen diseas three common counterargu discus none appear strong enough effect counter advoc view third section two potenti implic view advoc briefli touch upon quest cure treatment age gener attitud toward elderli conclud util object diseas concept age could seen diseas none consid counterargu pack enough punch discard implic complex intertwin need neg age diseas

2,Scientific Papers and Patents on Substances with Unproven Effects.,"It is evident from reviewing scientific literature that the quality of argumentation in some areas of medical research has deteriorated during the last decades. Publication of a series of questionable reliability has continued without making references to the published criticism; examples are discussed in this review. Another tendency is that drugs without proven efficiency are advertised, corresponding products patented and marketed as evidence-based medications. Professional publications are required to register drugs and dietary supplements to obtain permissions for the practical use; and such papers appeared, sometimes being of questionable reliability. Several examples are discussed in this review when substances without proven effects were patented and introduced into practice being supported by publications of questionable reliability. Some of the topics are not entirely clear; and the arguments provided here can induce a constructive discussion.","placebo, antioxidants, atherosclerosis, cardiovascular, dietary supplements, hormesis.",Recent Patents On Drug Delivery & Formulation,evid review scientif literatur qualiti argument area medic research deterior last decad public seri question reliabl continu without make refer publish critic exampl discus review anoth tendenc drug without proven effici advertis correspond product patent market medic profession public requir regist drug dietari supplement obtain permiss practic use paper appear sometim question reliabl sever exampl discus review substanc without proven effect patent introduc practic support public question reliabl topic entir clear argument provid induc construct discus scientif paper patent substanc unproven effect
3,Advances in Paper-Based Analytical Devices.,"Microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (μPADs) are the newest generation of lab-on-a-chip devices and have made significant strides in both our understanding of fundamental behavior and performance characteristics and expansion of their applications. μPADs have become useful analytical techniques for environmental analysis in addition to their more common application as medical point-of-care devices. Although the most common method for device fabrication is wax printing, numerous other techniques exist and have helped address factors ranging from solvent compatibility to improved device function. This review highlights recent reports of fabrication and design, modes of detection, and broad applications of μPADs. Such advances have enabled μPADs to be used in field and laboratory studies to address critical needs in fast, cheaper measurement technologies.","biomedical diagnostics, biosensors, environmental, microfluidics, paper-based","Annual Review Of Analytical Chemistry (Palo Alto, Calif.)",microfluid analyt devic μpad newest gener devic made signific stride understand fundament behavior perform characterist expans applic μpad becom use analyt techniqu environment analysi addit common applic medic devic although common method devic fabric wax print numer techniqu exist help address factor rang solvent compat improv devic function review highlight recent report fabric design mode detect broad applic μpad advanc enabl μpad use field laboratori studi address critic need fast cheaper measur technolog advanc analyt devic
4,"Is non-medical use normal? Normalisation, medicalisation and pharmaceutical consumption.","The theory of the normalisation of youth drug use in advanced capitalist societies has had an enduring legacy in contemporary drug scholarship. While the literature on the normalisation of 'illicit' drugs is well developed, less has been written about application of the theory to emerging discourse of pharmaceutical 'abuse', and how this might necessitate different thinking around what can be considered normal consumption. Pharmaceuticals are not directly associated with criminality, and their use does not traditionally attract stigma. In fact, social science scholarship has illustrated how many substances deemed illicit are normalised in the context of an ever-growing set of medical treatments. This paper explores the assumptions about legality, sociality and pleasure which sit behind the drug normalisation thesis, by reflecting on the relevance of drug normalisation in relation to pharmaceuticals, as well as examining scholarship on the medicalisation of society and qualitative research on non-medical use to illustrate the parallel processes of normalisation that apply to pharmaceuticals. The paper argues that questions of normalisation in relation to pharmaceutical use require a deeper engagement with the normative expectations we attach to pleasure, consumption and medicine, and the way this is structured by proximity to medical authority, whiteness and middle-classness.","medicalisation, middle-class, non-medical use, normalisation, pharmaceuticalisation, pharmaceuticals, white, youth",The International Journal On Drug Policy,theori normalis youth drug use advanc capitalist societi endur legaci contemporari drug scholarship literatur normalis drug well develop less written applic theori emerg discours pharmaceut might necessit differ think around consid normal consumpt pharmaceut directli associ crimin use tradit attract stigma fact social scienc scholarship illustr mani substanc deem illicit normalis context set medic treatment paper explor assumpt legal social pleasur sit behind drug normalis thesi reflect relev drug normalis relat pharmaceut well examin scholarship medicalis societi qualit research use illustr parallel process normalis appli pharmaceut paper argu question normalis relat pharmaceut use requir deeper engag norm expect attach pleasur consumpt medicin way structur proxim medic author white use normal normalis medicalis pharmaceut consumpt
5,Drug interactions of cola-containing drinks.,"Cola-containing drinks (CCDs) are among the most common drinks in the world. There are some reports on interactions between CCDs and some drugs. However, there is no review on reported and possible interactions of CCDs. Thus, this paper attempted to provide a comprehensive review on this subject. It is well-accepted that CCDs are acidic and contain caffeine. It has been suggested that these two properties potentiate interactions of CCDs with different drugs in the context of both pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic, which includes drug absorption, metabolism, and renal excretion of drugs. It has been shown that serum concentrations of MTX, clozapine, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and ibuprofen increased following CCD consumption; these interactions can be toxic. Additionally, it has been reported that serum levels of lithium and warfarin were decreased and their efficacy reduced when simultaneously administered with CCDs. Serum concentrations of erlotinib and different azoles, including itraconazol, posaconazole, and ketoconazole, have been shown to increase when these drugs were co-administered with a CCD. As proposed and discussed here, CCDs have the potential for interactions with numerous other drugs and thus clinicians should be aware of reported and potential interactions of CCDs with various medications in order to avoid adverse reactions and achieve expected clinical response.","cola-containing drinks, drug interactions, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics","Clinical Nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)",drink ccd among common drink world report interact ccd drug howev review report possibl interact ccd thu paper attempt provid comprehens review subject ccd acid contain caffein suggest two properti potenti interact ccd differ drug context pharmacodynam pharmacokinet includ drug absorpt metabol renal excret drug shown serum concentr mtx clozapin carbamazepin phenytoin ibuprofen increas follow ccd consumpt interact toxic addit report serum level lithium warfarin decreas efficaci reduc simultan administ ccd serum concentr erlotinib differ azol includ itraconazol posaconazol ketoconazol shown increas drug ccd propos discus ccd potenti interact numer drug thu clinician awar report potenti interact ccd variou medic order avoid advers reaction achiev expect clinic respons drug interact drink
6,Paper spray-MS for bioanalysis.,"This Review provides a general understanding of paper spray-MS, including the methodology and theory associated with a number of different related applications. This method has become a direct sampling/ionization method for mass spectrometric analysis at ambient conditions and, as a result, it has greatly simplified and increased the speed of mass-spectrum analysis. It has now become an increasingly popular and important method for MS. The first part of this review discusses the fundamentals of paper spray. Some modifications are also reviewed, including nib-assisted paper spray, droplet monitoring, high-throughput paper spray, leaf spray, tissue spray and wooden tip spray. The second part focuses on recent applications, including the analysis of DBS, foodstuffs, drugs and oil. These studies show that paper spray-MS has great potential for use as a fast sampling ionization method, and for the direct analysis of biological and chemical samples at ambient conditions.",no keywords,Bioanalysis,review provid gener understand paper includ methodolog theori associ number differ relat applic method becom direct method mass spectrometr analysi ambient condit result greatli simplifi increas speed analysi becom increasingli popular import method first part review discus fundament paper spray modif also review includ paper spray droplet monitor paper spray leaf spray tissu spray wooden tip spray second part focus recent applic includ analysi db foodstuff drug oil studi show paper great potenti use fast sampl ioniz method direct analysi biolog chemic sampl ambient condit paper bioanalysi
7,Stratified medicalization of schooling difficulties.,"Medicalization is a central topic of concern in the sociology of disability and of health and illness. In this paper, I examine how medicalization is inequitably applied and circulates in the context of schools, specifically in serving students with educational disabilities. My aim is to advance understandings of medicalization through this case. Using a mixed-methods design, I first show, descriptively, how race and gender intersectionally predict educational disability status in a dataset of all Wisconsin public school students. Next, I examine how racial and gender disparities in disability status are produced at the micro level, using interviews with 27 Wisconsin teachers, including in-depth discussions of 73 individual students that were struggling academically or behaviorally. My quantitative findings show variation by race, gender, and disability category: White children have higher probability of special education receipt than comparable children of color for academic difficulties, but lower probability for behavioral difficulties, and girls have lower probability than comparable boys overall. My interview data suggest that these disparate outcomes reflect stratified medicalization processes, in which institutional constraints, status beliefs, and cultural discourses of race and gender shape both stratified noticing of schooling difficulties and stratified interpretation of those difficulties as medicalized conditions.","disability, education, gender, medicalization, mixed-methods, race",Social Science & Medicine (1982),medic central topic concern sociolog disabl health ill paper examin medic inequit appli circul context school specif serv student educ disabl aim advanc understand medic case use design first show descript race gender intersect predict educ disabl statu dataset wisconsin public school student next examin racial gender dispar disabl statu produc micro level use interview wisconsin teacher includ discus individu student struggl academ behavior quantit find show variat race gender disabl categori white child higher probabl special educ receipt compar child color academ difficulti lower probabl behavior difficulti girl lower probabl compar boy overal interview data suggest dispar outcom reflect stratifi medic process institut constraint statu belief cultur discours race gender shape stratifi notic school difficulti stratifi interpret difficulti medic condit stratifi medic school difficulti

11,Tablets made from paper.,"The possibility to compress ordinary paper into tablets was systematically investigated in this study. Results proved that tablets can be made from paper, independent of the type of paper used. The tablets appear shiny and with a smooth surface. The pharmaceutical quality was acceptable, i.e. all tablets fulfilled the requirements for tablets according to the European Pharmacopeia. Drug-loaded tablets were produced by compression of drug-loaded paper. Drug loading did not alter the pharmaceutical quality. However, the uncoated tablets possessed an extremely fast disintegration, i.e. intense swelling upon contact with water, which might hamper the swallowing after oral administration. To avoid swelling tablets were successfully coated with a polymer film, leading to a prevention of swelling but immediate disintegration in simulated gastric fluid. In fact, tablets made from paper are a novel and promising strategy for improved oral drug delivery. They can be easily produced without any further excipients and possess pharmaceutical quality according to the European Pharmacopeia.","drug release, individualized therapy, oral drug delivery, paper, poorly soluble apis, tablets, tissue",International Journal Of Pharmaceutics,possibl compress ordinari paper tablet systemat investig studi result prove tablet made paper independ type paper use tablet appear shini smooth surfac pharmaceut qualiti accept tablet fulfil requir tablet accord european pharmacopeia tablet produc compress paper drug load alter pharmaceut qualiti howev uncoat tablet possess extrem fast disintegr intens swell upon contact water might hamper swallow oral administr avoid swell tablet success coat polym film lead prevent swell immedi disintegr simul gastric fluid fact tablet made paper novel promis strategi improv oral drug deliveri easili produc without excipi possess pharmaceut qualiti accord european pharmacopeia tablet made paper

13,Additive Manufacturing Technologies for Drug Delivery Applications.,"Patient to patient variability is one of the issues when administering medications to individuals with different health conditions, pharmacokinetic, age, fitness, gender, and race. This requires introducing smart and personalised drug delivery systems with controlled release profile manufactured using novel approaches. Additive manufacturing (AM) provides opportunities such as full customisation, design freedom, and on-site manufacturing, and materials recycling. As a result, the academic and industrial demand for additive manufacturing for drug delivery has been continuously increasing and showing impressive results for a wide range of products. This paper provides an extensive overview of AM technologies and their applications for drug delivery. The review discusses AM technologies including their working principles, processed materials, as well as current progress in drug delivery to produce personalized dosages for every patient with controlled release profile. AM potentials, industrial scale, and challenges are investigated with regards to practice and industrial applications. The paper covers novel possibilities of AM technologies and their pharmaceuticals applications, which indicate a promising healthcare future.","additive manufacturing, drug delivery, personalised mediations, polypill",International Journal Of Pharmaceutics,patient patient variabl one issu administ medic individu differ health condit pharmacokinet age fit gender race requir introduc smart personalis drug deliveri system control releas profil manufactur use novel approach addit manufactur provid opportun full customis design freedom manufactur materi recycl result academ industri demand addit manufactur drug deliveri continu increas show impress result wide rang product paper provid extens overview technolog applic drug deliveri review discus technolog includ work principl process materi well current progress drug deliveri produc person dosag everi patient control releas profil potenti industri scale challeng investig regard practic industri applic paper cover novel possibl technolog pharmaceut applic indic promis healthcar futur addit manufactur technolog drug deliveri applic

Portable and potentially portable methods are presented and critically discussed about (bio)chemical trace analysis and studies performed outside the controlled laboratory environment to rapidly help in crime scene inquiries or forensic intelligence purposes. A wide range of approaches including electrochemical sensors, microchip electrophoresis, ambient ionization on portable mass spectrometers, handheld Raman and NIR instruments as well as and point-of-need devices, like paper-based platforms, for in-field analysis of latent evidences, controlled substances, drug screening, hazards, and others to assist in law enforcements and solving crime more efficiently are highlighted. The covered examples have successfully demonstrated the huge potential of portable devices for on-site applications.

16,[Concepts. Minimally disruptive medicine].,"This paper presents some concepts about overdiagnosis and its consequences: overtreatment and the medicalization of the society. It recalls the origin of the term, that comes from the screening and diagnosis of cancer, and it reviews the strategies to overdiagnose. Furthermore, it analyses the conversion of illnesses diagnostic thresholds as well as the transformation of normal and vital processes and risk factors in illnesses. It shows some strategies to confront overdiagnosis at the time of medical consultation, including the management of uncertainty and the shared decision making through the right interpretation of the diagnosis results and treatment estimators. Finally, it shows the minimally disruptive medicine as the best strategy to face the disease burden induced by the overtreatment in patients suffering from multimorbidity.","atención centrada en el paciente, evidence based medicine, medical overuse, medicina basada en la evidencia, multimorbidity, multimorbilidad, patient centered care, sobrediagnóstico",Atencion Primaria,paper present concept overdiagnosi consequ overtreat medic societi recal origin term come screen diagnosi cancer review strategi overdiagnos furthermor analys convers ill diagnost threshold well transform normal vital process risk factor ill show strategi confront overdiagnosi time medic consult includ manag uncertainti share decis make right interpret diagnosi result treatment estim final show minim disrupt medicin best strategi face diseas burden induc overtreat patient suffer multimorbid concept minim disrupt medicin
17,"Pharmaceutical cocrystals, salts and polymorphs: Advanced characterization techniques.","The main goal of a novel drug development is to obtain it with optimal physiochemical, pharmaceutical and biological properties. Pharmaceutical companies and scientists modify active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), which often are cocrystals, salts or carefully selected polymorphs, to improve the properties of a parent drug. To find the best form of a drug, various advanced characterization methods should be used. In this review, we have described such analytical methods, dedicated to solid drug forms. Thus, diffraction, spectroscopic, thermal and also pharmaceutical characterization methods are discussed. They all are necessary to study a solid API in its intrinsic complexity from bulk down to the molecular level, gain information on its structure, properties, purity and possible transformations, and make the characterization efficient, comprehensive and complete. Furthermore, these methods can be used to monitor and investigate physical processes, involved in the drug development, in situ and in real time. The main aim of this paper is to gather information on the current advancements in the analytical methods and highlight their pharmaceutical relevance.","active pharmaceutical ingredient, crystallographic studies, drug, nmr crystallography, solubility, spectroscopic characterization, stability, thermal analysis",Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews,main goal novel drug develop obtain optim physiochem pharmaceut biolog properti pharmaceut compani scientist modifi activ pharmaceut ingredi api often cocryst salt care select polymorph improv properti parent drug find best form drug variou advanc character method use review describ analyt method dedic solid drug form thu diffract spectroscop thermal also pharmaceut character method discus necessari studi solid api intrins complex bulk molecular level gain inform structur properti puriti possibl transform make character effici comprehens complet furthermor method use monitor investig physic process involv drug develop situ real time main aim paper gather inform current advanc analyt method highlight pharmaceut relev pharmaceut cocryst salt polymorph advanc character techniqu
18,The concept of medicalisation reassessed.,"Medicalisation has been an important concept in sociological discussions of medicine since its adoption by medical sociologists in the early 1970s. Yet it has been criticised by some sociologists, in part because it seems too negative about medicine, and modified or replaced by others with concepts deemed more relevant like biomedicalisation and pharmaceuticalisation. My aim in this paper is to reassess the concept and consider whether it still has value in exploring significant aspects of the role of medicine in present-day society. I start with an archaeology of the concept's development and the different ways it has been used. This covers some familiar ground but is essential to the main task: examining criticisms of the concept and assessing its value. I conclude that the concept continues to have a crucial and productive place in sociological analyses of medicine and that the process of medicalisation is still a key feature of late-modern social life and culture.","medical practice/medical work, medicalisation, pharmaceuticals/pharmaceutical companies, power, professions/professionalisation",Sociology Of Health & Illness,medicalis import concept sociolog discus medicin sinc adopt medic sociologist earli yet criticis sociologist part seem neg medicin modifi replac other concept deem relev like biomedicalis pharmaceuticalis aim paper reassess concept consid whether still valu explor signific aspect role medicin societi start archaeolog concept develop differ way use cover familiar ground essenti main task examin critic concept assess valu conclud concept continu crucial product place sociolog analys medicin process medicalis still key featur social life cultur concept medicalis reassess
19,In vivo deposition of poorly soluble drugs.,"Administered drug molecules, whether dissolved or solubilized, have the potential to precipitate and accumulate as solid forms in tissues and cells within the body. This phase transition can significantly impact the pharmacokinetics of treatment. It is thus crucial to gain an understanding of how drug solubility/permeability, drug formulations and routes of administration affect in vivo behaviors of drug deposition. This review examines literature reports on the drug deposition in tissues and cells of poorly water-soluble drugs, as well as underlying physical mechanisms that lead to precipitation. Our work particularly highlights drug deposition in macrophages and the subcellular fate of precipitated drugs. We also propose a tissue permeability-based classification framework to evaluate precipitation potentials of poorly soluble drugs in major organs and tissues. The impact on pharmacokinetics is further discussed and needs to be considered in developing drug delivery systems. Finally, bioimaging techniques that are used to examine aggregated states and the intracellular trafficking of absorbed drugs are summarized.","bioimaging, drug precipitation, lipophilic drug, lysosomal-trapping, macrophage sequestration, tissue permeability",Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews,administ drug molecul whether dissolv solubil potenti precipit accumul solid form tissu cell within bodi phase transit significantli impact pharmacokinet treatment thu crucial gain understand drug drug formul rout administr affect vivo behavior drug deposit review examin literatur report drug deposit tissu cell poorli drug well underli physic mechan lead precipit work particularli highlight drug deposit macrophag subcellular fate precipit drug also propos tissu classif framework evalu precipit potenti poorli solubl drug major organ tissu impact pharmacokinet discus need consid develop drug deliveri system final bioimag techniqu use examin aggreg state intracellular traffick absorb drug summar vivo deposit poorli solubl drug
20,Modular design principle based on compartmental drug delivery systems.,"The current manufacturing solutions for oral solid dosage forms are fundamentally based on technologies from the 19th century. This approach is well suited for mass production of one-size-fits-all products; however, it does not allow for a straight-forward personalization and mass customization of the pharmaceutical end-product. In order to provide better therapies to the patients, a need for innovative manufacturing concepts and product design principles has been rising. Additive manufacturing opens up a possibility for compartmentalization of drug products, including design of spatially separated multidrug and functional excipient compartments. This compartmentalized solution can be further expanded to modular design thinking. Modular design is referring to combination of building blocks containing a given amount of drug compound(s) and related functional excipients into a larger final product. Implementation of modular design principles is paving the way for implementing the emerging personalization potential within health sciences by designing compartmental and reactive product structures that can be manufactured based on the individual needs of each patient. This review will introduce the existing compartmentalized product design principles and discuss the integration of these into edible electronics allowing for innovative control of drug release.","3d printing, additive manufacturing, compartmental systems, digital reconstruction, drug delivery, ingestible electronics, intellectual property, modular systems, smart medications",Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews,current manufactur solut oral solid dosag form fundament base technolog centuri approach well suit mass product product howev allow person mass custom pharmaceut order provid better therapi patient need innov manufactur concept product design principl rise addit manufactur open possibl compartment drug product includ design spatial separ multidrug function excipi compart compartment solut expand modular design think modular design refer combin build block contain given amount drug compound relat function excipi larger final product implement modular design principl pave way implement emerg person potenti within health scienc design compartment reactiv product structur manufactur base individu need patient review introduc exist compartment product design principl discus integr edibl electron allow innov control drug releas modular design principl base compartment drug deliveri system

22,Therapeutic management in the low-wage workplace.,"Medicalization represents an increasingly significant form of social control. Emergent evidence suggests that workplace managers take up medicalized practices and discourses to produce a compliant labor force, but this phenomenon has received limited sociological attention. This paper extends prior theories of medicalization to investigate therapeutic management in the low-wage workplace. I draw upon eight months of ethnographic fieldwork in Disability Works, a nonprofit job training program for people with mental illnesses, and interviews with other providers and advocates within this field. Disability Works harnesses therapy, psychiatry, and ""softer"" therapeutic practices such as mindfulness meditation, sleep hygiene, and positive affirmations to produce its workforce. This paper identifies two dimensions of therapeutic management: (1) it aims to inculcate work norms at the level of client-workers' embodied dispositions, and (2) it aims to transform structural problems into individual ones.

The paper substrate, from cellulose to glass fiber, is an inexpensive substrate that can be readily modified to suit a variety of applications. Milli- to micro-scale patterns can be designed to create a fast, cost-effective device that uses small amounts of reagents and samples. Finally, well-established chemical and biological methods can be adapted to paper to yield a portable device that can be used in resource-limited areas (e.g., field work). Altogether, the paper devices have grown into reliable analytical devices for screening low quality pharmaceuticals.

26,Should UK based Physiotherapists Choose Wisely?,"In 2012 the Choose Wisely campaign was launched in the United States in order to address concerns regarding medicalisation, over diagnosis and medical consumerism. The campaign has now spread internationally and includes a number of countries including Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Germany. The primary aim of the campaign is to facilitate healthcare professionals and patients to question the overall utility of medical interventions. Professionals through their professional organisations identify at least five commonly used interventions or tests, within their areas of speciality, which they feel provided no or little benefit to patients. This paper provides the background to the Choose Wisely campaign. The paper reviews the concepts of medicalisation, over diagnosis and medical consumerism, before considering the utility of the campaign in the UK alongside other forms of governance such as NICE. The paper goes on to consider distributive justice as the principal ethical issue related to the campaign. The paper concludes by asking if UK based Physiotherapists should Choose Wisely.","choose wisely, evidence-based practice, low value care, physiotherapy",Physiotherapy,choos wise campaign launch unit state order address concern regard medicalis diagnosi medic consumer campaign spread intern includ number countri includ canada australia new zealand germani primari aim campaign facilit healthcar profession patient question overal util medic intervent profession profession organis identifi least five commonli use intervent test within area special feel provid littl benefit patient paper provid background choos wise campaign paper review concept medicalis diagnosi medic consumer consid util campaign uk alongsid form govern nice paper goe consid distribut justic princip ethic issu relat campaign paper conclud ask uk base physiotherapist choos wise uk base physiotherapist choos wise
27,Optimization of the development of latent fingermarks on thermal papers.,"Thermal papers, commonly used for printed receipts or lottery tickets, are omnipresent in our everyday life. They are regarded as semi-porous substrates, and yet can be critical to analyze when looking for latent fingermarks due to their thermosensibility. The aim of this study was to investigate a development sequence that would better combine the adequate detection techniques in order to maximize the chances to develop latent fingermarks left on these substrates. Different methods of development have been compared on test substrates: black magnetic powder, Lumicyano™, thermal development, ninhydrin and 1,2-indanedione/ZnCl<sub>2</sub>.

28,Electromembrane extraction for pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis - Quo vadis.,"Electromembrane extraction (EME) was presented as a new microextraction concept in 2006, and since the introduction, substantial research has been conducted to develop this concept in different areas of analytical chemistry. To date, more than 100 research papers have been published on EME. The present paper discusses recent development of EME. The paper focuses on the principles of EME, and discusses how to optimize operational parameters. In addition, pharmaceutical and biomedical applications of EME are reviewed, with emphasis on basic drugs, acidic drugs, amino acids, and peptides. Finally, pros and cons of EME are discussed and future directions for EME are identified. Compared with other reviews focused on EME, the authors have especially highlighted their personal views about the most promising directions for the future, and identified the areas where more fundamental work is required.","amino acids, drug substances, electromembrane extraction (eme), peptides, sample preparation",Journal Of Pharmaceutical And Biomedical Analysis,electromembran extract eme present new microextract concept sinc introduct substanti research conduct develop concept differ area analyt chemistri date research paper publish eme present paper discus recent develop eme paper focus principl eme discus optim oper paramet addit pharmaceut biomed applic eme review emphasi basic drug acid drug amino acid peptid final pro con eme discus futur direct eme identifi compar review focus eme author especi highlight person view promis direct futur identifi area fundament work requir electromembran extract pharmaceut biomed analysi quo vadi
29,Paper-Based Fluidic Sensing Platforms for β-Adrenergic Agonist Residue Point-of-Care Testing.,"The illegal use of β-adrenergic agonists during livestock growth poses a threat to public health; the long-term intake of this medication can cause serious physiological side effects and even death. Therefore, rapid detection methods for β-adrenergic agonist residues on-site are required. Traditional detection methods such as liquid chromatography have limitations in terms of expensive instruments and complex operations. In contrast, paper methods are low cost, ubiquitous, and portable, which has led to them becoming the preferred detection method in recent years. Various paper-based fluidic devices have been developed to detect β-adrenergic agonist residues, including lateral flow immunoassays (LFAs) and microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (μPADs). In this review, the application of LFAs for the detection of β-agonists is summarized comprehensively, focusing on the latest advances in novel labeling and detection strategies. The use of μPADs as an analytical platform has attracted interest over the past decade due to their unique advantages and application for detecting β-adrenergic agonists, which are introduced here. Vertical flow immunoassays are also discussed for their shorter assay time and stronger multiplexing capabilities compared with LFAs. Furthermore, the development direction and prospects for the commercialization of paper-based devices are considered, shedding light on the development of point-of-care testing devices for β-adrenergic agonist residue detection.","biosensors, lateral flow immunoassay, microfluidics, paper-based device, point-of-care testing, β-adrenergic agonists",Biosensors,illeg use agonist livestock growth pose threat public health intak medic caus seriou physiolog side effect even death therefor rapid detect method agonist residu requir tradit detect method liquid chromatographi limit term expens instrument complex oper contrast paper method low cost ubiquit portabl led becom prefer detect method recent year variou fluidic devic develop detect agonist residu includ later flow immunoassay lfa microfluid analyt devic μpad review applic lfa detect summar comprehens focus latest advanc novel label detect strategi use μpad analyt platform attract interest past decad due uniqu advantag applic detect agonist introduc vertic flow immunoassay also discus shorter assay time stronger multiplex capabl compar lfa furthermor develop direct prospect commerci devic consid shed light develop test devic agonist residu detect fluidic sen platform agonist residu test
30,Controlling Fluorescent Readout in Paper-based Analytical Devices.,"Paper is an ideal candidate for the development of new disposable diagnostic devices because it is a low-cost material, allows transport of the liquid on the device by capillary action, and is environmentally friendly. Today, colorimetric analysis is most often used as a detection method for rapid tests (test strips or lateral flow devices) but usually gives only qualitative results and is limited by a relatively high detection threshold. Here, we describe studies using fluorescence as a readout tool for paper-based diagnostics. We study how the optical readout is affected by light transmission, scattering, and fluorescence as a function of paper characteristics such as thickness (grammage), water content, autofluorescence, and paper type/composition. We show that paper-based fluorescence analysis allows better optical readout compared to that of nitrocellulose, which is currently the material of choice in colorimetric assays. To reduce the loss of analyte molecules (e.g., proteins) due to adsorption to the paper surface, we coat the paper fibers with a protein-repellent hydrogel. For this purpose, we use hydrophilic copolymers consisting of <i>N</i>,<i>N</i>-dimethyl acrylamide and a benzophenone-based cross-linker, which are photochemically transformed into a fiber-attached polymer hydrogel on the paper fiber surfaces in situ. We show that the combination of fluorescence detection and the use of a protein-repellent coating enables sensitive paper-based analysis. Finally, the success of the strategy is demonstrated by using a simple LFD application as an example.","poc, fluorescence, paper based diagnostics, scattering, surface modification, μpad",Acs Biomaterials Science & Engineering,paper ideal candid develop new dispos diagnost devic materi allow transport liquid devic capillari action environment friendli today colorimetr analysi often use detect method rapid test test strip later flow devic usual give qualit result limit rel high detect threshold describ studi use fluoresc readout tool diagnost studi optic readout affect light transmiss scatter fluoresc function paper characterist thick grammag water content autofluoresc paper show fluoresc analysi allow better optic readout compar nitrocellulos current materi choic colorimetr assay reduc loss analyt molecul protein due adsorpt paper surfac coat paper fiber hydrogel purpos use hydrophil copolym consist n n acrylamid photochem transform polym hydrogel paper fiber surfac situ show combin fluoresc detect use coat enabl sensit analysi final success strategi demonstr use simpl lfd applic exampl control fluoresc readout analyt devic

The first example concerns the direct marketing of pharmaceutical products to consumers in the US, the second the use of psychology in semi-post-Cold War Korea, and the third the persisting authority of psychology in the treatment of the developmentally delayed. While these instances are not innately connected, looking at these as part of the process by which the authoritative knowledge is established will help us understand, albeit partially, the mechanism by which mental illness penetrates our lives as truth, and how this regime of truth is supported by the authority of psychology, psychiatry and psychoanalysis, what Foucault calls the 'psy-function,' reinforcing the medicalisation of our lives.","foucault, psy-function, mental illness, truth",Anthropology & Medicine,briefli explor three differ exampl exist mental ill development delay presum paper shed light way foucault call emerg regim truth someth exist made exist construct system truth around first exampl concern direct market pharmaceut product consum u second use psycholog war korea third persist author psycholog treatment development delay instanc innat connect look part process authorit knowledg establish help u understand albeit partial mechan mental ill penetr live truth regim truth support author psycholog psychiatri psychoanalysi foucault call reinforc medicalis live critiqu medicalis three instanc

35,Mesoporous Drug Delivery System: From Physical Properties of Drug in Solid State to Controlled Release.,"Mesoporous materials, which exhibit great potential in the control of polymorphs and delivery of poorly water-soluble drugs, have obtained considerable attention in the field of pharmaceutical science. The physical properties and release behaviors of amorphous or crystalline drugs may be affected by formulating them into mesoporous drug delivery systems. In the past few decades, an increasing amount of papers have been written about mesoporous drug delivery systems, which play a crucial role in improving the properties of drugs. Herein, mesoporous drug delivery systems are comprehensively reviewed in terms of their physicochemical characteristics, control of polymorphic forms, physical stability, in vitro performance, and in vivo performance. Moreover, the challenges and strategies of developing robust mesoporous drug delivery systems are also discussed.","confined crystallization, controlled release, in vitro and in vivo performance, mesoporous drug delivery system, polymorph control","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",mesopor materi exhibit great potenti control polymorph deliveri poorli drug obtain consider attent field pharmaceut scienc physic properti releas behavior amorph crystallin drug may affect formul mesopor drug deliveri system past decad increas amount paper written mesopor drug deliveri system play crucial role improv properti drug herein mesopor drug deliveri system comprehens review term physicochem characterist control polymorph form physic stabil vitro perform vivo perform moreov challeng strategi develop robust mesopor drug deliveri system also discus mesopor drug deliveri system physic properti drug solid state control releas

37,"Expired Medication: Societal, Regulatory and Ethical Aspects of a Wasted Opportunity.","A massive volume of expired medications amasses annually around the world because of pharmaceutical overprescription, combined with overproduction. The accumulation of pharmaceutical waste imposes ecological, economic and social/ethical burdens. Managing this presumed ""waste"" has developed into a global challenge due to the absence of specific regulations, unreasonable behavior of the patients, and an improper understanding of the concept of ""expired medications"" in general. This paper summaries, first, the recent literature reporting practices related to the disposal of unused medications. In this context, 48 papers from 34 countries with a total of 33,832 participants point towards a significant lack of public awareness regarding the appropriate disposal of such biologically potent chemicals. These findings are corroborated by a local survey on the disposal practices of unused medicines among pharmacy students at Saarland University. The regulatory aspects surrounding this topic, often based on the official guidelines for the disposal of expired medications and local waste management strategies, are then discussed in light of these findings. Finally, a closer inspection of the epistemic values of expired medications and different strategies for managing expired medications have been reviewed.","expiration date, expired medications, pharmaceutical waste, waste management",International Journal Of Environmental Research And Public Health,massiv volum expir medic amass annual around world pharmaceut overprescript combin overproduct accumul pharmaceut wast impos ecolog econom burden manag presum wast develop global challeng due absenc specif regul unreason behavior patient improp understand concept expir medic gener paper summari first recent literatur report practic relat dispos unus medic context paper countri total particip point toward signific lack public awar regard appropri dispos biolog potent chemic find corrobor local survey dispos practic unus medicin among pharmaci student saarland univers regulatori aspect surround topic often base offici guidelin dispos expir medic local wast manag strategi discus light find final closer inspect epistem valu expir medic differ strategi manag expir medic review expir medic societ regulatori ethic aspect wast opportun
38,Safe use of medication in patients with cirrhosis: pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic considerations.,"<b>Introduction</b>: The global burden of cirrhosis is rising, and clinicians increasingly face the challenge of safely prescribing medicines for complications of hepatic disease and comorbidities. Prescribing in patients with cirrhosis is complicated by alterations that can occur in the pharmacology of medicines.<b>Areas covered</b>: This paper provides an overview of current knowledge on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of medicines in patients with cirrhosis. We describe the pathophysiological changes that occur and their consequences on pharmacokinetic parameters. We explain that the influence of cirrhosis on the pharmacokinetics depends on several drug and patient characteristics. Patients with cirrhosis also have an increased susceptibility to some toxicological effects of medicines, such as renal impairment and hematological toxicity, which we describe in detail. In addition, we discuss approaches to apply this knowledge in practice and improve safe medication use in patients with cirrhosis.<b>Expert opinion</b>: Tailored pharmacotherapy is needed to ensure safe and appropriate use of medicines in patients with cirrhosis. Clinicians are supported by freely available recommendations on safe drug use in cirrhosis published on a website. In addition, a regular evaluation of medication use in patients with cirrhosis could resolve and prevent medication-related problems.","cirrhosis, hepatic impairment, hepatology, medication safety, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology",Expert Opinion On Drug Metabolism & Toxicology,b introduct global burden cirrhosi rise clinician increasingli face challeng safe prescrib medicin complic hepat diseas comorbid prescrib patient cirrhosi complic alter occur pharmacolog b area cover paper provid overview current knowledg pharmacokinet pharmacodynam medicin patient cirrhosi describ pathophysiolog chang occur consequ pharmacokinet paramet explain influenc cirrhosi pharmacokinet depend sever drug patient characterist patient cirrhosi also increas suscept toxicolog effect medicin renal impair hematolog toxic describ detail addit discus approach appli knowledg practic improv safe medic use patient b expert opinion tailor pharmacotherapi need ensur safe appropri use medicin patient cirrhosi clinician support freeli avail recommend safe drug use cirrhosi publish websit addit regular evalu medic use patient cirrhosi could resolv prevent problem safe use medic patient cirrhosi pharmacokinet pharmacodynam consider
39,Stability and compatibility of parenteral nutrition solutions; a review of influencing factors.,"Both stability and compatibility of parenteral nutrition solutions (PNS) with drug products are major concerns for clinicians and clinical pharmacists, especially when concurrent administration of PNS with intravenous medications (IVM) is unavoidable. Since the same physicochemical principles apply to both adult's and paediatrics' PNS, concerns about stability and compatibility may still apply to both. However, these concerns are relatively more common in paediatrics and neonatal clinical settings, where limited vascular access can be problematic and the coadministration of PNS and drugs is more common. In neonatal and paediatric populations, there have been few experimental studies and comprehensive evaluations looking at medication compatibility with frequently used PNS. This work is part of a larger research project concerned for compatibility of PNS with commonly used intravenous medication in paediatric and neonates. This paper captures and reviews published data on factors influencing stability and compatibility of parenteral nutrition solutions. This information will help clinicians and clinical pharmacists to understand the principals of the stability and compatibility of PNS, furthermore, it will inform better design of future compatibility studies, as it highlights the complexity of PNS and the multiple factors influencing the stability of PNS, and hence its compatibility with IVM. When preparing, prescribing, and administering the PNS, especially when co-administration with IVM is unavoidable, it is important to take into account the physicochemical properties of the PNS components and IVM as well as administration conditions and environmental factors. These factors should also be considered in the design of the compatibility studies of the PNS with the IVM.","amino acids, compatibility, glucose, intravenous medication, lipid, parenteral nutrition solutions, stability",European Journal Of Pharmaceutics And Biopharmaceutics : Official Journal Of Arbeitsgemeinschaft Fur Pharmazeutische Verfahrenstechnik E.V,stabil compat parenter nutrit solut pn drug product major concern clinician clinic pharmacist especi concurr administr pn intraven medic ivm unavoid sinc physicochem principl appli adult paediatr pn concern stabil compat may still appli howev concern rel common paediatr neonat clinic set limit vascular access problemat coadministr pn drug common neonat paediatr popul experiment studi comprehens evalu look medic compat frequent use pn work part larger research project concern compat pn commonli use intraven medic paediatr neonat paper captur review publish data factor influenc stabil compat parenter nutrit solut inform help clinician clinic pharmacist understand princip stabil compat pn furthermor inform better design futur compat studi highlight complex pn multipl factor influenc stabil pn henc compat ivm prepar prescrib administ pn especi ivm unavoid import take account physicochem properti pn compon ivm well administr condit environment factor factor also consid design compat studi pn ivm stabil compat parenter nutrit solut review influenc factor
40,Reducing Unspecific Protein Adsorption in Microfluidic Papers Using Fiber-Attached Polymer Hydrogels.,"Microfluidic paper combines pump-free water transport at low cost with a high degree of sustainability, as well as good availability of the paper-forming cellulosic material, thus making it an attractive candidate for point-of-care (POC) analytics and diagnostics. Although a number of interesting demonstrators for such paper devices have been reported to date, a number of challenges still exist, which limit a successful transfer into marketable applications. A strong limitation in this respect is the (unspecific) adsorption of protein analytes to the paper fibers during the lateral flow assay. This interaction may significantly reduce the amount of analyte that reaches the detection zone of the microfluidic paper-based analytical device (µPAD), thereby reducing its overall sensitivity. Here, we introduce a novel approach on reducing the nonspecific adsorption of proteins to lab-made paper sheets for the use in µPADs. To this, cotton linter fibers in lab-formed additive-free paper sheets are modified with a surrounding thin hydrogel layer generated from photo-crosslinked, benzophenone functionalized copolymers based on poly-(oligo-ethylene glycol methacrylate) (POEGMA) and poly-dimethyl acrylamide (PDMAA). This, as we show in tests similar to lateral flow assays, significantly reduces unspecific binding of model proteins. Furthermore, by evaporating the transport fluid during the microfluidic run at the end of the paper strip through local heating, model proteins can almost quantitatively be accumulated in that zone. The possibility of complete, almost quantitative protein transport in a µPAD opens up new opportunities to significantly improve the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of paper-based lateral flow assays.","poc, cellulose, entropic shielding, microfluidics, protein binding, surface functionalization, µpad","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",microfluid paper combin water transport low cost high degre sustain well good avail cellulos materi thu make attract candid poc analyt diagnost although number interest demonstr paper devic report date number challeng still exist limit success transfer market applic strong limit respect unspecif adsorpt protein analyt paper fiber later flow assay interact may significantli reduc amount analyt reach detect zone microfluid analyt devic µpad therebi reduc overal sensit introduc novel approach reduc nonspecif adsorpt protein paper sheet use µpad cotton linter fiber paper sheet modifi surround thin hydrogel layer gener benzophenon function copolym base glycol methacryl poegma acrylamid pdmaa show test similar later flow assay significantli reduc unspecif bind model protein furthermor evapor transport fluid microfluid run end paper strip local heat model protein almost quantit accumul zone possibl complet almost quantit protein transport µpad open new opportun significantli improv ratio later flow assay reduc unspecif protein adsorpt microfluid paper use polym hydrogel
41,"Medicalisation, pharmaceuticalisation, or both? Exploring the medical management of sleeplessness as insomnia.","In this paper we examine the medical management of sleeplessness as 'insomnia', through the eyes of general practitioners (GPs) and sleep experts in Britain. Three key themes were evident in the data. These related to (i) institutional issues around advocacy and training in sleep medicine (ii) conceptual issues in the diagnosis of insomnia (iii) and how these played out in terms of treatment issues. As a result, the bulk of medical management occurred at the primary rather than secondary care level. These issues are then reflected on in terms of the light they shed on relations between the medicalisation and the pharmaceuticalisation of sleeplessness as insomnia. Sleeplessness, we suggest, is only partially and problematically medicalised as insomnia to date at the conceptual, institutional and interactional levels owing to the foregoing factors. Much of this moreover, on closer inspection, is arguably better captured through recourse to pharmaceuticalisation, including countervailing moves and downward regulatory pressures which suggest a possible degree of depharmaceuticalisation in future, at least as far prescription hypnotics are concerned. Pharmaceuticalisation therefore, we conclude, has distinct analytical value in directing our attention, in this particular case, to important dynamics occurring within if not beyond the medicalisation of sleeplessness as insomnia.","drugs/medication, interviewing (qualitative), medical knowledge, medicalisation, primary care, sleep",Sociology Of Health & Illness,paper examin medic manag sleepless eye gener practition gp sleep expert britain three key theme evid data relat institut issu around advocaci train sleep medicin ii conceptu issu diagnosi insomnia iii play term treatment issu result bulk medic manag occur primari rather secondari care level issu reflect term light shed relat medicalis pharmaceuticalis sleepless insomnia sleepless suggest partial problemat medicalis insomnia date conceptu institut interact level owe forego factor much moreov closer inspect arguabl better captur recours pharmaceuticalis includ countervail move downward regulatori pressur suggest possibl degre depharmaceuticalis futur least far prescript hypnot concern pharmaceuticalis therefor conclud distinct analyt valu direct attent particular case import dynam occur within beyond medicalis sleepless insomnia medicalis pharmaceuticalis explor medic manag sleepless insomnia

The study suggests how students that do not score top can be labeled dyslexic and the social and moral consequences of that. I introduce the concept of ""consecrating medicalization"" in order to discriminate between the effects of medical diagnosis of members of different social classes. In this way, this paper contributes to further examining some key problems in medical sociology and the sociology of elites, by offering a framework of synthesis and integration.","consecration, dyslexia, elites, medicalization",The British Journal Of Sociology,base qualit data school sweden primari elit commun djursholm propos medic diagnosi student dyslex contribut consecr offer short cut success perform time reproduc differ social class studi suggest student score top label dyslex social moral consequ introduc concept consecr medic order discrimin effect medic diagnosi member differ social class way paper contribut examin key problem medic sociolog sociolog elit offer framework synthesi integr medic diagnosi dyslexia swedish elit school case consecr medic

However, the chiral resolution of such types of racemate is a challenging task for scientists. The evolution of efficient chiral selectors is a hope for the future. Some papers have described such types of chiral resolution. The different techniques used for the purpose are HPLC, micellar electrokinetic chromatography, supercritical fluid chromatography, capillary electrochromatography and capillary electrophoresis. Owing to these facts, it was necessary to review the enantiomeric resolution of racemic drugs having more than one chiral center. The present article describes the chiral resolution of labetalol, formoterol, nadolol, indenolol, nebivolol and diltiazem using above cited techniques. In addition, attempts have been made to discuss the chiral recognition mechanism and future perspectives.","chiral recognition mechanism, chiral resolution, chiral selectors, future perspectives, multiple chiral center racemates",Biomedical Chromatography : Bmc,drug one chiral center high medicin valu howev chiral resolut type racem challeng task scientist evolut effici chiral selector hope futur paper describ type chiral resolut differ techniqu use purpos hplc micellar electrokinet chromatographi supercrit fluid chromatographi capillari electrochromatographi capillari electrophoresi owe fact necessari review enantiomer resolut racem drug one chiral center present articl describ chiral resolut labetalol formoterol nadolol indenolol nebivolol diltiazem use cite techniqu addit attempt made discus chiral recognit mechan futur perspect drug multipl chiral center chromatographi capillari electrophoresi
44,Emerging 3D printing technologies for drug delivery devices: Current status and future perspective.,"The 'one-size-fits-all' approach followed by conventional drug delivery platforms often restricts its application in pharmaceutical industry, due to the incapability of adapting to individual pharmacokinetic traits. Driven by the development of additive manufacturing (AM) technology, three-dimensional (3D) printed drug delivery medical devices have gained increasing popularity, which offers key advantages over traditional drug delivery systems. The major benefits include the ability to fabricate 3D structures with customizable design and intricate architecture, and most importantly, ease of personalized medication. Furthermore, the emergence of multi-material printing and four-dimensional (4D) printing integrates the benefits of multiple functional materials, and thus provide widespread opportunities for the advancement of personalized drug delivery devices. Despite the remarkable progress made by AM techniques, concerns related to regulatory issues, scalability and cost-effectiveness remain major hurdles. Herein, we provide an overview on the latest accomplishments in 3D printed drug delivery devices as well as major challenges and future perspectives for AM enabled dosage forms and drug delivery systems.","3d printing, 4d printing, additive manufacturing, drug delivery devices, multi-material 3d printing",Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews,approach follow convent drug deliveri platform often restrict applic pharmaceut industri due incap adapt individu pharmacokinet trait driven develop addit manufactur technolog print drug deliveri medic devic gain increas popular offer key advantag tradit drug deliveri system major benefit includ abil fabric structur customiz design intric architectur importantli ea person medic furthermor emerg print print integr benefit multipl function materi thu provid widespread opportun advanc person drug deliveri devic despit remark progress made techniqu concern relat regulatori issu scalabl remain major hurdl herein provid overview latest accomplish print drug deliveri devic well major challeng futur perspect enabl dosag form drug deliveri system emerg print technolog drug deliveri devic current statu futur perspect

Drivers exceeding the prescribed limit face severe penalties, which they are often anxious to avoid, either by acquittal or by putting forward 'special reasons' why they should not be disqualified from driving. One frequently explored defence is that the accused was taking prescribed medication. Defence solicitors often ask the question whether the prescribed medication could have caused significantly altered blood ethanol concentrations. This paper reviews the impact of various medications and how they can influence the blood ethanol concentration. Although many drugs can interact with ethanol at a pharmacodynamic level, causing increased impairment, relatively few drugs interact with ethanol pharmacokinetically leading to significantly altered blood ethanol concentrations.",no keywords,"Medicine, Science, And The Law",uk maxim permit ethanol concentr drive mg ml blood μg ml breath mg ml urin driver exceed prescrib limit face sever penalti often anxiou avoid either acquitt put forward reason disqualifi drive one frequent explor defenc accus take prescrib medic defenc solicitor often ask question whether prescrib medic could caus significantli alter blood ethanol concentr paper review impact variou medic influenc blood ethanol concentr although mani drug interact ethanol pharmacodynam level caus increas impair rel drug interact ethanol pharmacokinet lead significantli alter blood ethanol concentr signific pharmacokinet interact ethanol

Deficiencies were identified in medication management in operating theatres (OT) at a large tertiary hospital. A perioperative pharmacist was employed for a 6-month pilot period, with permanent funding dependent on demonstration of agreed economic benefits. A multidisciplinary committee set goals, drove strategic initiatives and was accountable for delivery of outcomes. Pharmaceutical expenditure was analysed and high expenditure items targeted. Cost savings and staff satisfaction were measured at 6 months. Savings of A$63884 were achieved during the pilot period, resulting from optimised pharmaceutical unit pricing, OT medication stock on hand (imprest) review and redesigned medication management strategies. Improvements in medication management included better access to medications in the OT, rationalising available products to minimise wastage and implementation of guidelines and protocols for high-cost and high-risk medications. At 6 months, 97% of theatre staff supported continuation of the role; the project was extended with demonstrated cost savings of A$157265 at 12 months.

Although the authors very clearly pointed out the limitations and underlying assumptions for their delineations, these are too often overlooked and the classic paper's message is misinterpreted by broadening to cases that were not intended. Some members of the scientific community concluded from the paper that protein binding is not important. This was clearly not intended by the authors, as they finished their paper with a paragraph entitled: ""When is protein binding important?"" Misinterpretation of the underlying assumptions in the classic work can result in major pitfalls in drug development. Therefore, we revisit the topic of protein binding with the intention of clarifying when clinically relevant changes should be considered during drug development.","drug interaction, in vitro models, in vitro/in vivo correlations (ivivc), microdialysis, pharmacokinetics, protein binding",Journal Of Pharmaceutical Sciences,present paper ode classic citat benet hoener clin pharm ther classic paper huge impact drug develop way issu protein bind perceiv interpret although author clearli point limit underli assumpt delin often overlook classic paper messag misinterpret broaden case intend member scientif commun conclud paper protein bind import clearli intend author finish paper paragraph entitl protein bind import misinterpret underli assumpt classic work result major pitfal drug develop therefor revisit topic protein bind intent clarifi clinic relev chang consid drug develop protein bind import
51,Debating medicalization of Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C): learning from (policy) experiences across countries.,"Although Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C) is internationally considered a harmful practice, it is increasingly being medicalized allegedly to reduce its negative health effects, and is thus suggested as a harm reduction strategy in response to these perceived health risks. In many countries where FGM/C is traditionally practiced, the prevalence rates of medicalization are increasing, and in countries of migration, such as the United Kingdom, the United States of America or Sweden, court cases or the repeated issuing of statements in favor of presumed minimal forms of FGM/C to replace more invasive forms, has raised the debate between the medical harm reduction arguments and the human rights approach.","harm reduction, human rights, medical ethics, medicalized fgm/c",Reproductive Health,although femal genit intern consid harm practic increasingli medic allegedli reduc neg health effect thu suggest harm reduct strategi respons perceiv health risk mani countri tradit practic preval rate medic increas countri migrat unit kingdom unit state america sweden court case repeat issu statement favor presum minim form replac invas form rais debat medic harm reduct argument human right approach debat medic femal genit learn polici experi across countri
52,Bioinspired multistructured paper microfluidics for POCT.,"The rapid development of and the large market for medical diagnostics necessitate point-of-care testing (POCT) with superior sensitivity, miniaturization, multiple functionalities and high integration. Thus, flexible substrates with complex structures that provide multiple functions are in demand. Herein, we present multistructured pseudo-papers (MSPs) as a platform for building flexible microfluidics. Flexible and freestanding MSPs are generated by the self-assembly of colloidal silica crystals or core-shell copolymer elastic colloidal crystals on microcavity PDMS molds to form photonic crystals (PCs). Nitrocellulose (NC) multistructured pseudo-papers (NC MSPs) were obtained by etching SiO<sub>2</sub> PCs after NC precursor infiltration, while elastic copolymer (EC) multistructured pseudo-papers (EC MSPs) were directly peeled off the mold; both types of freestanding MSPs have ordered micropillars and nanocrystal structures and presented unique properties such as pumpless liquid transport and fluorescence and chemiluminescence (CL) enhancement. MSPs with designed patterns were fabricated by patterned PDMS molds, and complicated microfluidic chips were used to generate MSPs by utilizing these patterns as liquid channels. The MSPs were used for fabricating microfluidic sensors for human cardiac marker and cancer marker sensing; the features of these bioinspired MSPs indicate their potential for sensitive sensing, which will enable them to find broader applications in many fields.",no keywords,Lab On A Chip,rapid develop larg market medic diagnost necessit test poct superior sensit miniatur multipl function high integr thu flexibl substrat complex structur provid multipl function demand herein present multistructur msp platform build flexibl microfluid flexibl freestand msp gener colloid silica crystal copolym elast colloid crystal microcav pdm mold form photon crystal pc nitrocellulos nc multistructur nc msp obtain etch sio sub pc nc precursor infiltr elast copolym ec multistructur ec msp directli peel mold type freestand msp order micropillar nanocryst structur present uniqu properti pumpless liquid transport fluoresc chemiluminesc cl enhanc msp design pattern fabric pattern pdm mold complic microfluid chip use gener msp util pattern liquid channel msp use fabric microfluid sensor human cardiac marker cancer marker sen featur bioinspir msp indic potenti sensit sen enabl find broader applic mani field bioinspir multistructur paper microfluid poct

56,Caring on the margins of the healthcare system.,"This paper addresses the working practices of a mobile mental health outreach team in a large French city, one that 'targets' homeless people with severe psychiatric disorders who are considered 'hard to reach' by the public health authorities and medical services. Analysis of the team's work--where acts of curing and caring are closely tied--reveals the importance of moving beyond a polarized vision of cure and care. The paper departs from much of the literature on the medicalization of social problems by arguing that medicalization is not only a means of social control, but has ethical value as well. In examining the practices of frontline health workers, it aims to show that integrating the methods and theoretical approaches of social work in medical practice is necessary to address the specific problems of homeless people, to enable health professionals to pursue medical cures, and to challenge the shortcomings of public policy.","france, medicalization, mentally ill homeless, street work",Anthropology & Medicine,paper address work practic mobil mental health outreach team larg french citi one homeless peopl sever psychiatr disord consid reach public health author medic servic analysi team work act cure care close tie reveal import move beyond polar vision cure care paper depart much literatur medic social problem argu medic mean social control ethic valu well examin practic frontlin health worker aim show integr method theoret approach social work medic practic necessari address specif problem homeless peopl enabl health profession pursu medic cure challeng shortcom public polici care margin healthcar system
57,Comprehensive Review on Drug-target Interaction Prediction - Latest Developments and Overview.,"Drug-target interactions (DTIs) are an important part of the drug development process. When the drug (a chemical molecule) binds to a target (proteins or nucleic acids), it modulates the biological behavior/function of the target, returning it to its normal state. Predicting DTIs plays a vital role in the drug discovery (DD) process as it has the potential to enhance efficiency and reduce costs. However, DTI prediction poses significant challenges and expenses due to the time-consuming and costly nature of experimental assays. As a result, researchers have increased their efforts to identify the association between medications and targets in the hopes of speeding up drug development and shortening the time to market. This paper provides a detailed discussion of the initial stage in drug discovery, namely drug-target interactions. It focuses on exploring the application of machine learning methods within this step. Additionally, we aim to conduct a comprehensive review of relevant papers and databases utilized in this field. Drug target interaction prediction covers a wide range of applications: drug discovery, prediction of adverse effects and drug repositioning. The prediction of drugtarget interactions can be categorized into three main computational methods: docking simulation approaches, ligand-based methods, and machine-learning techniques.","machine learning, chemoinformatics, drug discovery, drug-target interactions, medications., prediction computational models",Current Drug Discovery Technologies,interact dti import part drug develop process drug chemic molecul bind target protein nucleic acid modul biolog target return normal state predict dti play vital role drug discoveri dd process potenti enhanc effici reduc cost howev dti predict pose signific challeng expens due costli natur experiment assay result research increas effort identifi associ medic target hope speed drug develop shorten time market paper provid detail discus initi stage drug discoveri name interact focus explor applic machin learn method within step addit aim conduct comprehens review relev paper databas util field drug target interact predict cover wide rang applic drug discoveri predict advers effect drug reposit predict drugtarget interact categor three main comput method dock simul approach method techniqu comprehens review interact predict latest develop overview
58,Achievements in robotic automation of solvent extraction and related approaches for bioanalysis of pharmaceuticals.,"Currently, the growing demand on quick, easy and ecological sample pretreatment methods is unquestionable. Such challenge involves also approaches focusing on the analysis of pharmaceuticals and other endogenous compounds in biological matrices, termed as Bioanalysis. Solvent extraction such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), derived liquid phase microextraction (LPME) and related approaches such as solid liquid extraction (SLE), proved to be applicable in bioanalysis, as numerous papers have been published in this field. However, their manual performances may suffer from a long-term and laborious preparation, due to the inherent complexity of the biological samples. A high sample-throughput (enabling measurement of tens or hundreds of samples on a daily basis) can be achieved when automation of sample pretreatment is performed, resulting in decreased imprecision and low waste production of hazardous solvents and risky biological materials. Here, robotic systems have a key role, especially when multiple processing (e.g., 96-well plate format) and coupling to modern analytical instrumentation (e.g. LC-MS) are combined. A thorough overview on the up-to-date automations of LLE, LPME, SLE and solid LLE via robotics, is therefore presented. Pharmaceuticals and related compounds determined in classical liquid biological samples (i.e. plasma/serum, whole blood, urine, saliva etc.) and modern dried matrix spots (DMS) were considered as analytes of interest. The methodologies were critically compared to manual setups and among themselves.","automation, bioanalysis, dried matrix spots, liquid phase microextraction, liquid-liquid extraction, robotics, solid-liquid extraction","Journal Of Chromatography.

59,Disease-mongering through clinical trials.,"Our goal in this paper is to articulate a precise concept of at least a certain kind of disease-mongering, showing how pharmaceutical marketing can commercially exploit certain diseases when their best definition is given through the success of a treatment in a clinical trial. We distinguish two types of disease-mongering according to the way they exploit the definition of the trial population for marketing purposes. We argue that behind these two forms of disease-mongering there are two well-known problems in the statistical methodology of clinical trials (the reference class problem and the distinction between statistical and clinical significance). Overcoming them is far from simple.","clinical trials, disease-mongering, reference class problem, statins, statistical significance, valium",Studies In History And Philosophy Of Biological And Biomedical Sciences,goal paper articul precis concept least certain kind show pharmaceut market commerci exploit certain diseas best definit given success treatment clinic trial distinguish two type accord way exploit definit trial popul market purpos argu behind two form two problem statist methodolog clinic trial refer class problem distinct statist clinic signific overcom far simpl clinic trial

Diagnosis is a critical first step in effectively managing their spread. Paper-based microfluidic diagnostics first emerged in 2007 as a low-cost alternative to conventional laboratory testing, with the goal of improving accessibility to medical diagnostics in developing countries. In this review, we examine the advances in paper-based microfluidic diagnostics for medical diagnosis in the context of global health from 2007 to 2016. The theory of fluid transport in paper is first presented. The next section examines the strategies that have been employed to control fluid and analyte transport in paper-based assays. Tasks such as mixing, timing, and sequential fluid delivery have been achieved in paper and have enabled analytical capabilities comparable to those of conventional laboratory methods. The following section examines paper-based sample processing and analysis. The most impactful advancement here has been the translation of nucleic acid analysis to a paper-based format. Smartphone-based analysis is another exciting development with potential for wide dissemination. The last core section of the review highlights emerging health applications, such as male fertility testing and wearable diagnostics.

61,The potential of three-dimensional printing for pediatric oral solid dosage forms.,"Pediatric patients often require individualized dosing of medicine due to their unique pharmacokinetic and developmental characteristics. Current methods for tailoring the dose of pediatric medications, such as tablet splitting or compounding liquid formulations, have limitations in terms of dosing accuracy and palatability. This paper explores the potential of 3D printing as a solution to address the challenges and provide tailored doses of medication for each pediatric patient. The technological overview of 3D printing is discussed, highlighting various 3D printing technologies and their suitability for pharmaceutical applications. Several individualization options with the potential to improve adherence are discussed, such as individualized dosage, custom release kinetics, tablet shape, and palatability. To integrate the preparation of 3D printed medication at the point of care, a decentralized manufacturing model is proposed. In this setup, pharmaceutical companies would routinely provide materials and instructions for 3D printing, while specialized compounding centers or hospital pharmacies perform the printing of medication. In addition, clinical opportunities of 3D printing for dose-finding trials are emphasized. On the other hand, current challenges in adequate dosing, regulatory compliance, adherence to quality standards, and maintenance of intellectual property need to be addressed for 3D printing to close the gap in personalized oral medication.","3d printing, additive manufacturing, compounded medicine, decentralized manufacturing, pediatric medication, personalized dosage forms","Acta Pharmaceutica (Zagreb, Croatia)",pediatr patient often requir individu dose medicin due uniqu pharmacokinet development characterist current method tailor dose pediatr medic tablet split compound liquid formul limit term dose accuraci palat paper explor potenti print solut address challeng provid tailor dose medic pediatr patient technolog overview print discus highlight variou print technolog suitabl pharmaceut applic sever individu option potenti improv adher discus individu dosag custom releas kinet tablet shape palat integr prepar print medic point care decentr manufactur model propos setup pharmaceut compani would routin provid materi instruct print special compound center hospit pharmaci perform print medic addit clinic opportun print trial emphas hand current challeng adequ dose regulatori complianc adher qualiti standard mainten intellectu properti need address print close gap person oral medic potenti print pediatr oral solid dosag form

63,Drug Contamination of U.S. Paper Currency and Forensic Relevance of Canine Alert to Paper Currency: A Critical Review of the Scientific Literature.,"Several studies have reported on wide-spread contamination of U.S. paper currency with cocaine and to a lesser extent other illicit drugs. Canines are trained and employed to search for and alert to drugs. Canine alert to currency has been used as evidence that currency has been directly involved in illicit drug trafficking to justify currency seizure and forfeiture. This assertion, particularly when the only evidence is based upon canine alert, has been challenged in the courts considering that most currency in circulation is contaminated with cocaine. Comprehensive review of the scientific literature establishes that (i) 67-100% of circulated U.S. currency is contaminated with cocaine ranging from a few nanograms to over one milligram/bill (ii) various biological and environmental parameters impact canine alert to drugs. It is concluded that canine alert to U.S. currency is not sufficiently reliable to determine that currency was directly used in an illicit drug transaction.","canine alert, cocaine, critical review, currency contamination, forensic relevance, forensic science",Journal Of Forensic Sciences,sever studi report contamin paper currenc cocain lesser extent illicit drug canin train employ search alert drug canin alert currenc use evid currenc directli involv illicit drug traffick justifi currenc seizur forfeitur assert particularli evid base upon canin alert challeng court consid currenc circul contamin cocain comprehens review scientif literatur establish circul currenc contamin cocain rang nanogram one ii variou biolog environment paramet impact canin alert drug conclud canin alert currenc suffici reliabl determin currenc directli use illicit drug transact drug contamin paper currenc forens relev canin alert paper currenc critic review scientif literatur
64,Enantiomeric resolution of multiple chiral centres racemates by capillary electrophoresis.,"Enantiomeric resolution of multichiral centre racemates is an important area as some multichiral centre racemates are of great medicinal importance. However, enantioseparation of such types of racemates is a challenging task. Amongst many analytical techniques, capillary electrophoresis is a powerful technique and may be used to resolve such racemates. Only few papers are available describing enantiomeric resolution of such racemates. Therefore, efforts have been made to describe the enantiomeric resolution of multichiral centre racemates by capillary electrophoresis. This article discusses the importance of multichiral racemates, the need for capillary electrophoresis in enantiomeric resolution and chiral resolution of multichiral centre racemates using various chiral selectors. Further, attempts have been made to discuss the future challenges and prospects of enantiomeric resolution of multichiral racemates. The various chiral selectors used for the purpose are chiral crown ether, cyclodextrins, polysaccharides, macrocyclic glycopeptide antibiotics and ligand exchange.","capillary electrophoresis, chiral selectors, enantiomeric resolution, future challenges and prospectives, multiple chiral centre racemates",Biomedical Chromatography : Bmc,enantiomer resolut multichir centr racem import area multichir centr racem great medicin import howev enantiosepar type racem challeng task amongst mani analyt techniqu capillari electrophoresi power techniqu may use resolv racem paper avail describ enantiomer resolut racem therefor effort made describ enantiomer resolut multichir centr racem capillari electrophoresi articl discus import multichir racem need capillari electrophoresi enantiomer resolut chiral resolut multichir centr racem use variou chiral selector attempt made discus futur challeng prospect enantiomer resolut multichir racem variou chiral selector use purpos chiral crown ether cyclodextrin polysaccharid macrocycl glycopeptid antibiot ligand exchang enantiomer resolut multipl chiral centr racem capillari electrophoresi
65,Love and romantic relationship in the domain of medicine.,"In this paper, I explore the nature of medical interventions like neuromodulation on the complex human experience of love. Love is built upon two fundamental natures, viz: the biological and the psychosocial. As a result of this distinction, scientists, and bioethicists have been exploring the possible ways this complex human experience can be biologically tampered with to produce some supposed higher-order ends like well-being and human flourishing. At the forefront in this quest are Earp, Sandberg and Savulescu whose research works over ten years has focused on the good that could stem from the medicalization of love. I acknowledge the various criticisms that have been made against this stance. However, most of these criticisms have been directed towards the mere side effects and sociocultural disservices that could result from the process of using drugs to influence human romantic relationships and in the end, critiques endorse the medicalization of love on the basis that its benefits outweigh the disadvantages. Consequently, I advance two strands of arguments against ""medically-assisted love,"" the ontological and the socio-ethical arguments. The former presupposes that beyond the possible side effects of medicalizing love there is something inherently mistaken about this effort and there is something intrinsically different about love that distinguishes it from its medically-engineered alternative. In the latter argument, I claim that drug interventions in romantic love contravene the very nature of medicine. Overall, I believe that critiques were still able to endorse medicalizing love despite their objections because they were only looking at one direction, the physical/cultural complications.","biology, love, medical interventions, medicine, ontology","Medicine, Health Care, And Philosophy",paper explor natur medic intervent like neuromodul complex human experi love love built upon two fundament natur viz biolog psychosoci result distinct scientist bioethicist explor possibl way complex human experi biolog tamper produc suppos end like human flourish forefront quest earp sandberg savulescu whose research work ten year focus good could stem medic love acknowledg variou critic made stanc howev critic direct toward mere side effect sociocultur disservic could result process use drug influenc human romant relationship end critiqu endors medic love basi benefit outweigh disadvantag consequ advanc two strand argument love ontolog argument former presuppos beyond possibl side effect medic love someth inher mistaken effort someth intrins differ love distinguish altern latter argument claim drug intervent romant love contraven natur medicin overal believ critiqu still abl endors medic love despit object look one direct complic love romant relationship domain medicin
66,Pharmaceutical approaches for enhancing solubility and oral bioavailability of poorly soluble drugs.,"High solubility in water and physiological fluids is an indispensable requirement for the pharmacological efficacy of an active pharmaceutical ingredient. Indeed, it is well established that pharmaceutical substances exhibiting limited solubility in water are inclined towards diminished and inconsistent absorption following oral administration, consequently resulting in variability in therapeutic outcomes. The current advancements in combinatorial chemistry and pharmaceutical design have facilitated the creation of drug candidates characterized by increased lipophilicity, elevated molecular size, and reduced aqueous solubility. Undoubtedly, the issue of poorly water-soluble medications has been progressively escalating over recent years. Indeed, 40% of the top 200 oral medications marketed in the United States, 33% of drugs listed in the US pharmacopoeia, 75% of compounds under development and 90% of new chemical entities are insufficiently water-soluble compounds. In order to address this obstacle, formulation scientists employ a variety of approaches, encompassing both physical and chemical methods such as prodrug synthesis, salt formation, solid dispersions formation, hydrotropic substances utilization, solubilizing agents incorporation, cosolvent addition, polymorphism exploration, cocrystal creation, cyclodextrins complexation, lipid formulations, particle size reduction and nanoformulation techniques. Despite the utilization of these diverse approaches, the primary reason for the failure in new drug development persists as the poor aqueous solubility of pharmaceutical compounds. This paper, therefore, delves into the foundational principles that underpin the implementation of various formulation strategies, along with a discussion on the respective advantages and drawbacks associated with each approach. Additionally, a discourse is provided regarding methodological frameworks for making informed decisions on selecting an appropriate formulation strategy to effectively tackle the key challenges posed during the development of a poorly water-soluble drug candidate.","bioavailability, dissolution rate, formulation, solubility",European Journal Of Pharmaceutics And Biopharmaceutics : Official Journal Of Arbeitsgemeinschaft Fur Pharmazeutische Verfahrenstechnik E.V,high solubl water physiolog fluid indispens requir pharmacolog efficaci activ pharmaceut ingredi inde well establish pharmaceut substanc exhibit limit solubl water inclin toward diminish inconsist absorpt follow oral administr consequ result variabl therapeut outcom current advanc combinatori chemistri pharmaceut design facilit creation drug candid character increas lipophil elev molecular size reduc aqueou solubl undoubtedli issu poorli medic progress escal recent year inde top oral medic market unit state drug list u pharmacopoeia compound develop new chemic entiti insuffici compound order address obstacl formul scientist employ varieti approach encompass physic chemic method prodrug synthesi salt format solid dispers format hydrotrop substanc util solubil agent incorpor cosolv addit polymorph explor cocryst creation cyclodextrin complex lipid formul particl size reduct nanoformul techniqu despit util diver approach primari reason failur new drug develop persist poor aqueou solubl pharmaceut compound paper therefor delv foundat principl underpin implement variou formul strategi along discus respect advantag drawback associ approach addit discours provid regard methodolog framework make inform decis select appropri formul strategi effect tackl key challeng pose develop poorli drug candid pharmaceut approach enhanc solubl oral bioavail poorli solubl drug

Therefore, in the sanitary papers, creation of a suitable antibacterial property is necessary. In this way, the plant extracts were prepared using solid-liquid extraction method from the Rosmarinus officinalis, Olea europaea, Mentha spicata and Punica granatum. Relatively, the total phenol and flavonoid contents were determined according to colorimetric method. Their antioxidant activity was evaluated using DPPH method. The extracts were sprayed on the surface of the handsheets, and then their antibacterial activity was investigated. The results showed that extracts from the P. granatum has the highest phenol (5.82%) and antioxidant activity (71.13%), while the extract from the R. officinalis had the highest flavonoid (4.23%) and antibacterial activity (90.43%). Hence, it can be concluded that these two extracts could be the suitable combinations to create desirable antibacterial properties in the manufacture of papers with sanitary purposes.","antibacterial paper, antioxidant activity, physical and mechanical properties, plant extracts, total phenol and flavonoid contents",Natural Product Research,paper porou structur suitabl medium growth bacteria therefor sanitari paper creation suitabl antibacteri properti necessari way plant extract prepar use extract method rosmarinu officinali olea europaea mentha spicata punica granatum rel total phenol flavonoid content determin accord colorimetr method antioxid activ evalu use dpph method extract spray surfac handsheet antibacteri activ investig result show extract granatum highest phenol antioxid activ extract officinali highest flavonoid antibacteri activ henc conclud two extract could suitabl combin creat desir antibacteri properti manufactur paper sanitari purpos evalu compound manufactur antibacteri paper
68,Embracing and rejecting the medicalization of autism in Italy.,"Medicalization is increasingly recognized as a bidirectional process, with patients and their families as agents. The paper considers the specific case of the medicalization of autism in Italy, from the point of view of parents of autistic people with different levels of support needs. Through reporting and comparing results of two independently conducted qualitative studies, this paper aims to analyze how parents embrace and resist the medicalization of autism in their everyday lives and in healthcare contexts. Both studies involved participant-observation with services that targeted autistic people and interviews with parents, professionals, and autistic people. Results show that parents of autistic people both embrace and resist medicalization. While parents (sometimes ambivalently) accept the responsibilization inherent in their engagement with interventions (a sort of ""therapeutization"" of life) and reject lay expertise by deferring to experts' knowledge, they also resist the application of medical labels, language and practices in various ways in their everyday lives. Both embracing and resisting medicalization can be useful for achieving overarching social goals of being a good parent, helping their children, and pursuing respect and social harmony. Medicalization derives not only from the cultural dominance of medical discourses, which seems to incorporate resistance to medicalization stances, but also from the absence of continuity and coordination of services, particularly in the Italian context of public (but increasingly privatizing) health and welfare services.","autism, biological citizenship, medicalization, parents, somatic expertise",Social Science & Medicine (1982),medic increasingli recogn bidirect process patient famili agent paper consid specif case medic autism itali point view parent autist peopl differ level support need report compar result two independ conduct qualit studi paper aim analyz parent embrac resist medic autism everyday live healthcar context studi involv servic target autist peopl interview parent profession autist peopl result show parent autist peopl embrac resist medic parent sometim ambival accept responsibil inher engag intervent sort therapeut life reject lay expertis defer expert knowledg also resist applic medic label languag practic variou way everyday live embrac resist medic use achiev overarch social goal good parent help child pursu respect social harmoni medic deriv cultur domin medic discours seem incorpor resist medic stanc also absenc continu coordin servic particularli italian context public increasingli privat health welfar servic embrac reject medic autism itali
69,Packaging analysis of counterfeit medicines.,"The authentication of the packaging represents an important step in the investigation of suspected counterfeits of pharmaceutical products. The visual comparison with a retained sample is the first step to detect a counterfeited packaging. Due to the improvement of technologies like printing, the emergence of counterfeits with a better appearance can be observed. Moreover counterfeits are nowadays often a combination of fake and genuine parts that have been manipulated. Authenticating each part of the product is important in the frame of the investigation to understand how the counterfeiters proceed, and which prevention measures should be taken. Lab instruments like spectrometers can help confirm counterfeits of packaging for packaging components on which visually, no difference with a reference would be observed. In this study several analytical tools were evaluated to help support the authentication of the primary and secondary packaging of one medicinal product as an example using seven reference materials and five counterfeits. In some cases, visual examination of the packaging already enabled to detect counterfeits of the studied features. Also the boxes, leaflets and vials have been analysed with Infrared (IR) spectroscopy, Raman microspectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and microcomputed tomography (microCT). According to the obtained results, IR and XRF could support the visual examination of the different packaging components. Despite the small amount of counterfeits, relevant links could also be detected between the studied cases based on the packaging characteristics.","counterfeits, ir spectroscopy, packaging, raman microspectroscopy, sem, xrf spectroscopy",Forensic Science International,authent packag repres import step investig suspect counterfeit pharmaceut product visual comparison retain sampl first step detect counterfeit packag due improv technolog like print emerg counterfeit better appear observ moreov counterfeit nowaday often combin fake genuin part manipul authent part product import frame investig understand counterfeit proceed prevent measur taken lab instrument like spectromet help confirm counterfeit packag packag compon visual differ refer would observ studi sever analyt tool evalu help support authent primari secondari packag one medicin product exampl use seven refer materi five counterfeit case visual examin packag alreadi enabl detect counterfeit studi featur also box leaflet vial analys infrar ir spectroscopi raman microspectroscopi fluoresc xrf spectroscopi scan electron microscopi sem microcomput tomographi microct accord obtain result ir xrf could support visual examin differ packag compon despit small amount counterfeit relev link could also detect studi case base packag characterist packag analysi counterfeit medicin

71,Microfluidic paper-based analytical devices for potential use in quantitative and direct detection of disease biomarkers in clinical analysis.,"Clinicians, working in the health-care diagnostic systems of developing countries, currently face the challenges of rising costs, increased number of patient visits, and limited resources. A significant trend is using low-cost substrates to develop microfluidic devices for diagnostic purposes. Various fabrication techniques, materials, and detection methods have been explored to develop these devices. Microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (μPADs) have gained attention for sensing multiplex analytes, confirming diagnostic test results, rapid sample analysis, and reducing the volume of samples and analytical reagents. μPADs, which can provide accurate and reliable direct measurement without sample pretreatment, can reduce patient medical burden and yield rapid test results, aiding physicians in choosing appropriate treatment. The objectives of this review are to provide an overview of the strategies used for developing paper-based sensors with enhanced analytical performances and to discuss the current challenges, limitations, advantages, disadvantages, and future prospects of paper-based microfluidic platforms in clinical diagnostics. μPADs, with validated and justified analytical performances, can potentially improve the quality of life by providing inexpensive, rapid, portable, biodegradable, and reliable diagnostics.","biomedical applications, biosensors, clinical diagnostics, fabrication techniques, microfluidic paper-based analytical device, multiplex analysis","Journal Of Chromatography.

73,"The risk of corruption in public pharmaceutical procurement: how anti-corruption, transparency and accountability measures may reduce this risk.","<b>Background</b>: The goal of the public procurement of pharmaceuticals is to purchase sufficient quantities of high-quality pharmaceuticals at cost-effective prices for a given population. This goal can be undercut if corruption infiltrates the procurement process. Good procurement practices can help mitigate the risks of corruption and support equitable access to affordable and high-quality medicines.<b>Objectives</b>: This paper aims to 1) examine manifestations of corruption in the pharmaceutical procurement process and key factors behind them, and 2) identify how to design and implement effective anti-corruption, transparency and accountability mechanisms within this process.<b>Methods</b>: This paper was informed by a narrative literature review from 1996 to the present. The search focused on publications that addressed the issue of pharmaceutical procurement and governance and corruption issues. Our search included peer-reviewed literature, books, grey literature such as working papers, reports published by international organizations and donor agencies, and some media articles. Some documents used in this paper were already known to the authors.<b>Results</b>: Procurement is highly vulnerable to corruption particularly in the health sector. What is more, corruption in the procurement process does not appear to be limited to any one level of government or type of health system. The better integration of accountability, transparency and anti-corruption mechanisms in the procurement process is needed to reduce the risk of corruption.<b>Conclusions</b>: Lessons learned suggest that anti-corruption, transparency and accountability mechanisms in the pharmaceutical procurement process, such as open contracting and integrity pacts are helpful towards reducing the risk of corruption.","anti-corruption, transparency and accountability, procurement practices, accountability, e-procurement, good governance, health, open contracting, transparency",Global Health Action,b background goal public procur pharmaceut purchas suffici quantiti pharmaceut price given popul goal undercut corrupt infiltr procur process good procur practic help mitig risk corrupt support equit access afford b object paper aim examin manifest corrupt pharmaceut procur process key factor behind identifi design implement effect transpar account mechan within b method paper inform narr literatur review present search focus public address issu pharmaceut procur govern corrupt issu search includ literatur book grey literatur work paper report publish intern organ donor agenc medium articl document use paper alreadi known b result procur highli vulner corrupt particularli health sector corrupt procur process appear limit one level govern type health system better integr account transpar mechan procur process need reduc risk b conclus lesson learn suggest transpar account mechan pharmaceut procur process open contract integr pact help toward reduc risk corrupt risk corrupt public pharmaceut procur transpar account measur may reduc risk
74,Self-assembled all-polysaccharide hydrogel film for versatile paper-based food packaging.,"Paper-based packaging generally has poor performances in the gas/oil barriers. This work reports a paper-based packaging material prepared via the modification of conventional papers with TEMPO-oxidized cellulose nanofibers (TOCN)/cationic guar gum (CGG) hydrogel film. Specifically, the hydrogel film modification was realized through a layer-by-layer deposition on paper. The hydrogel film modification significantly improved the mechanical and barrier properties of the paper. Specifically, the 4-layer hydrogel film modified paper showed a tensile strength of 34.03 MPa and a burst strength of 510 kPa, respectively. In contrast, the unmodified paper exhibited a tensile strength of 26.78 MPa and a bursting strength of 388 kPa. The packaging performance of this TOCN/CGG hydrogel film modified paper was demonstrated via the fresh mooncake packaging test. Such hydrogel film not only provided the oil resistance, but also maintained the mooncake's freshness. This material can serve as a green and sustainable food packaging.","film, food packaging, guar gum, nanocellulose, paper",Carbohydrate Polymers,packag gener poor perform barrier work report packag materi prepar via modif convent paper cellulos nanofib tocn guar gum cgg hydrogel film specif hydrogel film modif realiz deposit paper hydrogel film modif significantli improv mechan barrier properti paper specif hydrogel film modifi paper show tensil strength mpa burst strength kpa respect contrast unmodifi paper exhibit tensil strength mpa burst strength kpa packag perform hydrogel film modifi paper demonstr via fresh mooncak packag test hydrogel film provid oil resist also maintain mooncak fresh materi serv green sustain food packag hydrogel film versatil food packag
75,Family Caregiving and the Intergenerational Transmission of Poverty.,"The United States relies on uncompensated family caregivers to provide most of the long-term care required by older adults as they age. But such care comes at a significant financial cost to these caregivers in the form of lower lifetime earnings and diminished (or even no) Social Security retirement benefits, ineligibility for Medicare coverage of their healthcare costs, and minimal retirement savings. To reduce the impact of uncompensated caregiving on the intergenerational transmission of poverty, this paper discusses three possible mechanisms of compensating family caregivers: public payments, deemed wage credits under Social Security, and income tax incentives.",no keywords,"The Journal Of Law, Medicine & Ethics : A Journal Of The American Society Of Law, Medicine & Ethics",unit state reli uncompens famili caregiv provid care requir older adult age care come signific financi cost caregiv form lower lifetim earn diminish even social secur retir benefit inelig medicar coverag healthcar cost minim retir save reduc impact uncompens caregiv intergener transmiss poverti paper discus three possibl mechan compens famili caregiv public payment deem wage credit social secur incom tax incent famili caregiv intergener transmiss poverti
76,Materials for microfluidic chip fabrication.,"Through manipulating fluids using microfabricated channel and chamber structures, microfluidics is a powerful tool to realize high sensitive, high speed, high throughput, and low cost analysis. In addition, the method can establish a well-controlled microenivroment for manipulating fluids and particles. It also has rapid growing implementations in both sophisticated chemical/biological analysis and low-cost point-of-care assays. Some unique phenomena emerge at the micrometer scale. For example, reactions are completed in a shorter amount of time as the travel distances of mass and heat are relatively small; the flows are usually laminar; and the capillary effect becomes dominant owing to large surface-to-volume ratios. In the meantime, the surface properties of the device material are greatly amplified, which can lead to either unique functions or problems that we would not encounter at the macroscale. Also, each material inherently corresponds with specific microfabrication strategies and certain native properties of the device. Therefore, the material for making the device plays a dominating role in microfluidic technologies. In this Account, we address the evolution of materials used for fabricating microfluidic chips, and discuss the application-oriented pros and cons of different materials. This Account generally follows the order of the materials introduced to microfluidics. Glass and silicon, the first generation microfluidic device materials, are perfect for capillary electrophoresis and solvent-involved applications but expensive for microfabriaction. Elastomers enable low-cost rapid prototyping and high density integration of valves on chip, allowing complicated and parallel fluid manipulation and in-channel cell culture. Plastics, as competitive alternatives to elastomers, are also rapid and inexpensive to microfabricate. Their broad variety provides flexible choices for different needs. For example, some thermosets support in-situ fabrication of arbitrary 3D structures, while some perfluoropolymers are extremely inert and antifouling. Chemists can use hydrogels as highly permeable structural material, which allows diffusion of molecules without bulk fluid flows. They are used to support 3D cell culture, to form diffusion gradient, and to serve as actuators. Researchers have recently introduced paper-based devices, which are extremely low-cost to prepare and easy to use, thereby promising in commercial point-of-care assays. In general, the evolution of chip materials reflects the two major trends of microfluidic technology: powerful microscale research platforms and low-cost portable analyses. For laboratory research, chemists choosing materials generally need to compromise the ease in prototyping and the performance of the device. However, in commercialization, the major concerns are the cost of production and the ease and reliability in use. There may be new growth in the combination of surface engineering, functional materials, and microfluidics, which is possibly accomplished by the utilization of composite materials or hybrids for advanced device functions. Also, significant expanding of commercial applications can be predicted.",no keywords,Accounts Of Chemical Research,manipul fluid use microfabr channel chamber structur microfluid power tool realiz high sensit high speed high throughput low cost analysi addit method establish microenivro manipul fluid particl also rapid grow implement sophist analysi assay uniqu phenomenon emerg micromet scale exampl reaction complet shorter amount time travel distanc mass heat rel small flow usual laminar capillari effect becom domin owe larg ratio meantim surfac properti devic materi greatli amplifi lead either uniqu function problem would encount macroscal also materi inher correspond specif microfabr strategi certain nativ properti devic therefor materi make devic play domin role microfluid technolog account address evolut materi use fabric microfluid chip discus pro con differ materi account gener follow order materi introduc microfluid glass silicon first gener microfluid devic materi perfect capillari electrophoresi applic expens microfabriact elastom enabl rapid prototyp high densiti integr valv chip allow complic parallel fluid manipul cell cultur plastic competit altern elastom also rapid inexpens microfabr broad varieti provid flexibl choic differ need exampl thermoset support fabric arbitrari structur perfluoropolym extrem inert antifoul chemist use hydrogel highli permeabl structur materi allow diffus molecul without bulk fluid flow use support cell cultur form diffus gradient serv actuat research recent introduc devic extrem prepar easi use therebi promis commerci assay gener evolut chip materi reflect two major trend microfluid technolog power microscal research platform portabl analys laboratori research chemist choos materi gener need compromis ea prototyp perform devic howev commerci major concern cost product ea reliabl use may new growth combin surfac engin function materi microfluid possibl accomplish util composit materi hybrid advanc devic function also signific expand commerci applic predict materi microfluid chip fabric
77,Developments in coupled solid-phase extraction-capillary electrophoresis 2009-2011.,"This article presents an overview of the design and application of coupled solid-phase extraction-capillary electrophoresis (SPE-CE) systems that have been reported in the literature between January 2009 and July 2011. The present paper is an update of two previous review papers covering the years 2000-2009 (Electrophoresis 2008, 29, 108-128; Electrophoresis 2010, 31, 44-54). Both in-line and on-line SPE-CE approaches are treated and outlined. Attention is paid to emerging technological developments, such as the use of carbon nanotubes and magnetic particles for on-line extraction of sample components prior to CE analysis. Selected examples illustrate the applicability of SPE-CE in biomedical, pharmaceutical, environmental and food analysis. A full overview of recent SPE-CE studies is given in table format, providing information about sample type, SPE sorbent, coupling mode, detection mode and limit of detection.

78,Is Aging a Disease? The Theoretical Definition of Aging in the Light of the Philosophy of Medicine.,"In the philosophical debate on aging, it is common to raise the question of the theoretical definition of aging in terms of its possible characterization as a disease. Understanding aging as a disease seems to imply its medicalization, which has important practical consequences. In this paper, we analyze the question of whether aging is a disease by appealing to the concept of disease in the philosophy of medicine. As a result of this analysis, we argue that a pragmatist approach to the conception of disease is the best alternative to highlight the relevance of the medicalization of aging. From this pragmatist perspective, it can be seen that the notion of aging is going through a conceptual change, and aging can today be understood as a not radically different process from any other condition that is usually considered a disease.","aging, disease, philosophy of medicine, pragmatism",The Journal Of Medicine And Philosophy,philosoph debat age common rais question theoret definit age term possibl character diseas understand age diseas seem impli medic import practic consequ paper analyz question whether age diseas appeal concept diseas philosophi medicin result analysi argu pragmatist approach concept diseas best altern highlight relev medic age pragmatist perspect seen notion age go conceptu chang age today understood radic differ process condit usual consid diseas age diseas theoret definit age light philosophi medicin
79,Patient Autonomy and Quality of Care in Telehealthcare.,"Telemedicine is a complex field including various applications and target groups. Especially telehealthcare is seen by many as a means to revolutionize medicine. It gives patients the opportunity to take charge of their own health by using self-tracking devices and allows health professionals to treat patients from a distance. To some, this means an empowerment of patient autonomy as well as an improvement in the quality of care. Others state the dangers of depersonalization of medicine and the pathologization of daily life. This paper examines the ethical implications of telehealthcare, focusing on patient autonomy and quality of care by analyzing metareviews, randomized controlled trials and narrative ethical analyses on the topic. As a result, we conclude that the technically enhanced encounter between patients and health professionals may mean an empowerment of patient autonomy when it goes along with a personal relationship based on trust, assistance and support. When it comes to the quality of care, telehealthcare may lead to an improvement as long it is adopted to the patient's individual needs.","empowerment, patient autonomy, quality of care, telehealthcare, telemedicine",Science And Engineering Ethics,telemedicin complex field includ variou applic target group especi telehealthcar seen mani mean revolution medicin give patient opportun take charg health use devic allow health profession treat patient distanc mean empower patient autonomi well improv qualiti care other state danger deperson medicin patholog daili life paper examin ethic implic telehealthcar focus patient autonomi qualiti care analyz metareview random control trial narr ethic analys topic result conclud technic enhanc encount patient health profession may mean empower patient autonomi goe along person relationship base trust assist support come qualiti care telehealthcar may lead improv long adopt patient individu need patient autonomi qualiti care telehealthcar
80,In vitro - In vivo correlation in the development of oral drug formulation: A screenshot of the last two decades.,"In vitro - in vivo correlation (IVIVC) allows prediction of the in vivo performance of a pharmaceutical product based on its in vitro drug release profiles and can be used to optimize formulations, set dissolution limits, reduce the number of bioequivalence studies during product development, and facilitate certain regulatory decisions. This review article aimed to assess papers published in the last two decades regarding the use of the IVIVC in the development of oral formulations, to demonstrate the scenario in this area, as well as to describe the main characteristics of the assessed studies. A systematic search of PubMed and Web of Science databases was conducted to retrieve articles reporting the use of the IVIVC in the oral formulation development in the period from 1998 to 2018. The qualified studies were abstracted regarding drug name, dosage form, BCS class, in vitro and in vivo data, level of IVIVC, number of formulations, presence of the validation and predictability. The discussion was supported by these data, which allowed to address broadly strengths and weaknesses in this area. Moreover, a large database has been described in this article containing different IVIVC models, with different substances, providing support to scientists interested in this area.","biopharmaceutics classification system, development, dissolution, ivivc, in vitro – in vivo correlation, oral formulation",International Journal Of Pharmaceutics,vitro vivo correl ivivc allow predict vivo perform pharmaceut product base vitro drug releas profil use optim formul set dissolut limit reduc number bioequival studi product develop facilit certain regulatori decis review articl aim assess paper publish last two decad regard use ivivc develop oral formul demonstr scenario area well describ main characterist assess studi systemat search pubm web scienc databas conduct retriev articl report use ivivc oral formul develop period qualifi studi abstract regard drug name dosag form bc class vitro vivo data level ivivc number formul presenc valid predict discus support data allow address broadli strength weak area moreov larg databas describ articl contain differ ivivc model differ substanc provid support scientist interest area vitro vivo correl develop oral drug formul screenshot last two decad
81,Detection and quantitation of synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists in infused papers from prisons in a constantly evolving illicit market.,"Drug misuse in prisons contributes to increased disruption and violence and negatively impacts prisoner safety, rehabilitation, and recovery. Synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists (SCRAs), colloquially known as ""spice"", are infused into papers and are of particular concern in a prison setting where they are commonly vaped. Methods for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of SCRA infused papers, including impurity profiling, were developed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) with qualitative confirmation by ultra high pressure liquid chromatography with photodiode array and quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry detection (UPLC-PDA-QToF-MS) and applied to 354 individual seized paper samples originating from 168 seizures from three Scottish prisons. Of these samples, 41% (146 samples from 101 seizures) contained at least one SCRA and multiple SCRAs were detected on 23% of these papers. Concentrations ranged from < 0.05-1.17 mg/cm<sup>2</sup> paper, representing the first reported quantitative data for SCRA infused papers. An evolution in the SCRAs detected was demonstrated; 5F-MDMB-PINACA (5F-ADB) predominated until late 2018, after which time 5F-MDMB-PICA and 4F-MDMB-BINACA became increasingly more prevalent, followed by the arrival of MDMB-4en-PINACA in June 2019. Concentration mapping data from two seized paper samples demonstrated that SCRA concentrations across larger papers were highly variable (0.47-2.38 mg/cm<sup>2</sup> paper) making consistent dosing by users, and representative sampling by laboratory analysts, difficult. Near real-time qualitative and quantitative information on SCRAs circulating in prisons acts as an early warning system for SCRAs emerging on the wider illicit market, inform the methods used to detect them and limit supply, and provide information to support harm reduction measures.","forensic chemistry, infused papers, new psychoactive substances, prison, synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists",Drug Testing And Analysis,drug misus prison contribut increas disrupt violenc neg impact prison safeti rehabilit recoveri synthet cannabinoid receptor agonist scra colloqui known spice infus paper particular concern prison set commonli vape method qualit quantit analysi scra infus paper includ impur profil develop use ga spectrometri qualit confirm ultra high pressur liquid chromatographi photodiod array quadrupol time flight mass spectrometri detect appli individu seiz paper sampl origin seizur three scottish prison sampl sampl seizur contain least one scra multipl scra detect paper concentr rang sup paper repres first report quantit data scra infus paper evolut scra detect demonstr predomin late time becam increasingli preval follow arriv june concentr map data two seiz paper sampl demonstr scra concentr across larger paper highli variabl sup paper make consist dose user repres sampl laboratori analyst difficult near qualit quantit inform scra circul prison act earli warn system scra emerg wider illicit market inform method use detect limit suppli provid inform support harm reduct measur detect quantit synthet cannabinoid receptor agonist infus paper prison constantli evolv illicit market
82,An Intelligent System for Proper Management and Disposal of Unused and Expired Medications.,"For years, several countries have been concerned about how to dispose of unused pharmaceuticals that can endanger human health and the environment. Moreover, some people are in desperate need of medical attention and medications, but they lack the financial resources to obtain them. In Saudi Arabia, there are no take-back medicine programs, and there is no published research on how medications properly are disposed. The aim of this research is to use the power of artificial intelligence to assist in the proper management and disposal of expired and unused medications and to develop a prototype device for collecting medication by automatically classifying medications for proper disposal and donation. In this research, artificial intelligence technologies such as web-based expert systems, image recognition and classification algorithms, chatbots, and the internet of things are used to assist in a take-back medications program. In conclusion, the prototype design of a web-based expert system and the device reduced improper disposal risks by providing significant advice on the safe disposal of unwanted pharmaceuticals. By using an organized method of collecting expired medications, the benefits were made possible.","chatbot, disposal of medication, donation device, image classification, take-back medication program, web-based expert system",International Journal Of Environmental Research And Public Health,year sever countri concern dispos unus pharmaceut endang human health environ moreov peopl desper need medic attent medic lack financi resourc obtain saudi arabia medicin program publish research medic properli dispos aim research use power artifici intellig assist proper manag dispos expir unus medic develop prototyp devic collect medic automat classifi medic proper dispos donat research artifici intellig technolog expert system imag recognit classif algorithm chatbot internet thing use assist medic program conclus prototyp design expert system devic reduc improp dispos risk provid signific advic safe dispos unwant pharmaceut use organ method collect expir medic benefit made possibl intellig system proper manag dispos unus expir medic

84,A concise review of applications of micellar liquid chromatography to study biologically active compounds.,"The features of micellar systems are outstanding compared with conventional RP-LC ones. Therefore, the unique properties of micellar chromatography (MLC) are widely recognized. In this short review the applicability of MLC as an in vitro method for the determination of biological activity is discussed. For this purpose many specific examples of MLC applications supported by the theoretical backgrounds of the cited biological activity areas as well as the factors affecting them are presented. This study collects and organizes the most important references of bioactivity determination which were created both recently and in the past, using the MLC method. Although there are many papers on the MLC there is no literature review focused particularly on its applicability in the study of biological activity of various compounds. This work can be treated as a significant review of so far published papers which particularly emphasizes the importance of MLC as in vitro method for determination of bioactivity of different compounds.

85,Improving Medication Dosing in the Obese Patient.,"The purpose of this paper is to provide clinicians with important considerations and caveats when evaluating published literature on medication dosing in obese subjects, since much of this literature involves short-term pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic studies that are not designed to look at clinically important outcomes. A secondary objective is to suggest improvements in the reporting of dosing information derived from clinical studies and incorporated into product information labeling that should help clinicians design medication-specific dosing regimens for patients with obesity. Data sources included published studies, review papers, and clinical practice guidelines concerning drug dosing of subjects with obesity. Medication dosing recommendations in product labeling typically are derived from studies of normal healthy volunteers and patients with single-system disease states or patients in a specialized setting (e.g. operating room, intensive care unit). Even in studies with relatively large sample sizes there are often relatively few subjects with extremes of body composition such as patients with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, so the appropriateness of labeled dosing information for these subjects is particularly ill-defined. Investigations of medication labeling information have demonstrated the inadequacy of this information for dosing patients of more extreme body size. Clinical investigations of drugs should be designed and the results reported in a manner that allows for meaningful recommendations for drug dosing in patients with varying degrees of obesity. Until and when such studies are routinely performed, there are steps that can be taken by the pharmaceutical industry, clinicians, and governmental agencies to help insure optimal drug dosing in obesity.",no keywords,Clinical Drug Investigation,purpos paper provid clinician import consider caveat evalu publish literatur medic dose obes subject sinc much literatur involv pharmacokinet pharmacodynam studi design look clinic import outcom secondari object suggest improv report dose inform deriv clinic studi incorpor product inform label help clinician design dose regimen patient obes data sourc includ publish studi review paper clinic practic guidelin concern drug dose subject obes medic dose recommend product label typic deriv studi normal healthi volunt patient diseas state patient special set oper room intens care unit even studi rel larg sampl size often rel subject extrem bodi composit patient bodi mass index bmi greater sup appropri label dose inform subject particularli investig medic label inform demonstr inadequaci inform dose patient extrem bodi size clinic investig drug design result report manner allow meaning recommend drug dose patient vari degre obes studi routin perform step taken pharmaceut industri clinician government agenc help insur optim drug dose obes improv medic dose obes patient
86,Medicalising the menace? The symbiotic convergence of medicine and law enforcement in the medicalisation of marijuana in Minnesota.,"The medicalisation of marijuana has occurred rapidly, albeit nonuniformly, across the US and around the world over the past 3 decades. This paper centres on the medicalisation of marijuana in Minnesota-which has one of the most restrictive programs in the country-as a case for evaluating the negotiation of institutional boundaries with the shift from criminalisation to medicalisation after nearly a century of criminal prohibition. Drawing upon Foucauldian discourse analyses of the medical and law enforcement associations' position statements and legislative hearings that shaped medical marijuana policy in Minnesota, this paper demonstrates a symbiotic convergence between medicine and law enforcement through the deployment of shared discursive strategies in their opposition to medical marijuana that reinforce marijuana's criminalised status by solidifying the boundaries between proper medicine and dangerous drugs. Criminal justice and medical institutions draw upon one another's definitions, logics, and practices in a mutually constitutive manner, while still maintaining distinct user subjects and institutional interventions for each based on the user's access to state-approved forms of marijuana. The consequences for the governing of marijuana in Minnesota are explored, as well as the broader implications for the sociological study of medicalisation and criminalisation with respect to the governance of drugs and health.","criminalisation, discourse analysis, governance, institutional boundaries, medical marijuana",Sociology Of Health & Illness,medicalis marijuana occur rapidli albeit nonuniformli across u around world past decad paper centr medicalis marijuana one restrict program case evalu negoti institut boundari shift criminalis medicalis nearli centuri crimin prohibit draw upon foucauldian discours analys medic law enforc associ posit statement legisl hear shape medic marijuana polici minnesota paper demonstr symbiot converg medicin law enforc deploy share discurs strategi opposit medic marijuana reinforc marijuana criminalis statu solidifi boundari proper medicin danger drug crimin justic medic institut draw upon one anoth definit logic practic mutual constitut manner still maintain distinct user subject institut intervent base user access form marijuana consequ govern marijuana minnesota explor well broader implic sociolog studi medicalis criminalis respect govern drug health medicalis menac symbiot converg medicin law enforc medicalis marijuana minnesota
87,Overview of Spanlastics: A Groundbreaking Elastic Medication Delivery Device with Versatile Prospects for Administration <i>via</i> Various Routes.,"When compared to the challenges associated with traditional dosage forms, medication delivery systems based on nanotechnology have been a huge boon. One such candidate for medication delivery is spanlastics, an elastic nanovesicle that can transport a diverse array of medicinal compounds. The use of spanlastics has been associated with an increase in interest in alternative administration methods. The non-ionic surfactant or surfactant blend is the main component of spanlastics. The purpose of this review was primarily to examine the potential of spanlastics as a delivery system for a variety of medication classes administered via diverse routes. Science Direct, Google Scholar, and Pubmed were utilized to search the academic literature for this review. Several studies have demonstrated that spanlastics greatly improve therapeutic effectiveness, increase medication absorption, and decrease drug toxicity. This paper provides a summary of the composition and structure of spanlastics along with their utility in the delivery of various therapeutic agents by adopting different routes. Additionally, it provides an overview of the numerous disorders that may be treated using drugs that are contained in spanlastic vesicles.","drug toxicity, elastic nanovesicle, medicinal compounds., nanotechnology, non-ionic surfactant, spanlastics",Current Pharmaceutical Design,compar challeng associ tradit dosag form medic deliveri system base nanotechnolog huge boon one candid medic deliveri spanlast elast nanovesicl transport diver array medicin compound use spanlast associ increas interest altern administr method surfact surfact blend main compon spanlast purpos review primarili examin potenti spanlast deliveri system varieti medic class administ via diver rout scienc direct googl scholar pubm util search academ literatur review sever studi demonstr spanlast greatli improv therapeut effect increas medic absorpt decreas drug toxic paper provid summari composit structur spanlast along util deliveri variou therapeut agent adopt differ rout addit provid overview numer disord may treat use drug contain spanlast vesicl overview spanlast groundbreak elast medic deliveri devic versatil prospect administr via variou rout

89,Is premenstrual dysphoric disorder really a disorder?,"Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) was recently moved to a full category in the DSM-5 (the latest edition of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders). It also appears set for inclusion as a separate disorder in the ICD-11 (the upcoming edition of the World Health Organization's International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems). This paper argues that PMDD should not be listed in the DSM or the ICD at all, adding to the call to recognise PMDD as a socially constructed disorder. I first present the argument that PMDD pathologises understandable anger/distress and that to do so is potentially dangerous. I then present evidence that PMDD is a culture-bound phenomenon, not a universal one. I also argue that even if (1) medication produces a desired effect, (2) there are biological correlates with premenstrual anger/distress, (3) such anger/distress seems to occur monthly, and (4) women are more likely than men to be diagnosed with affective disorders, none of these factors substantiates that premenstrual anger/distress is caused by a mental disorder. I argue that to assume they do is to ignore the now accepted role that one's environment and psychology play in illness development, as well as arguments concerning the social construction of mental illness. In doing so, I do not claim that there are no women who experience premenstrual distress or that their distress is not a lived experience. My point is that such distress can be recognised and considered significant without being pathologised and that it is unethical to describe premenstrual anger/distress as a mental disorder. Further, if the credibility of women's suffering is subject to doubt without a clinical diagnosis, then the way to address this problem is to change societal attitudes towards women's suffering, not to label women as mentally ill. The paper concludes with some broader implications for women and society of the change in status of PMDD in the DSM-5 as well as a sketch of critical policy suggestions to address these implications.",no keywords,Journal Of Bioethical Inquiry,premenstru dysphor disord pmdd recent move full categori latest edit american psychiatr associ diagnost statist manual mental disord also appear set inclus separ disord upcom edit world health organ intern statist classif diseas relat health problem paper argu pmdd list dsm icd ad call recognis pmdd social construct disord first present argument pmdd pathologis understand potenti danger present evid pmdd phenomenon univers one also argu even medic produc desir effect biolog correl premenstru seem occur monthli woman like men diagnos affect disord none factor substanti premenstru caus mental disord argu assum ignor accept role one environ psycholog play ill develop well argument concern social construct mental ill claim woman experi premenstru distress distress live experi point distress recognis consid signific without pathologis uneth describ premenstru mental disord credibl woman suffer subject doubt without clinic diagnosi way address problem chang societ attitud toward woman suffer label woman mental paper conclud broader implic woman societi chang statu pmdd well sketch critic polici suggest address implic premenstru dysphor disord realli disord
90,Prescriptions and proscriptions: moralising sleep medicines.,"The pharmaceuticalisation of sleep is a contentious issue. Sleep medicines get a 'bad press' due to their potential for dependence and other side effects, including studies reporting increased mortality risks for long-term users. Yet relatively little qualitative social science research has been conducted into how people understand and negotiate their use/non-use of sleep medicines in the context of their everyday lives. This paper draws on focus group data collected in the UK to elicit collective views on and experiences of prescription hypnotics across different social contexts. Respondents, we show, drew on a range of moral repertoires which allowed them to present themselves and their relationships with hypnotics in different ways. Six distinct repertoires about hypnotic use are identified in this regard: the 'deserving' patient, the 'responsible' user, the 'compliant' patient, the 'addict', the 'sinful' user and the 'noble' non user. These users and non-users are constructed drawing on cross-cutting themes of addiction and control, ambivalence and reflexivity. Such issues are in turn discussed in relation to recent sociological debates on the pharmaceuticalisation/de-pharmaceuticalisation of everyday life and the consumption of medicines in the UK today.","drugs/medication, uk, pharmaceuticals/pharmaceutical companies, sleep",Sociology Of Health & Illness,pharmaceuticalis sleep contenti issu sleep medicin get press due potenti depend side effect includ studi report increas mortal risk user yet rel littl qualit social scienc research conduct peopl understand negoti sleep medicin context everyday live paper draw focu group data collect uk elicit collect view experi prescript hypnot across differ social context respond show drew rang moral repertoir allow present relationship hypnot differ way six distinct repertoir hypnot use identifi regard patient user patient user non user user construct draw theme addict control ambival reflex issu turn discus relat recent sociolog debat everyday life consumpt medicin uk today prescript proscript moralis sleep medicin

92,Transgender medicalization and the attempt to evade psychological distress.,"In this paper the author argues that trans-identification and its associated medical treatment can constitute an attempt to evade experiences of psychological distress. This occurs on three levels. Firstly, the trans person themselves may seek to evade dysregulated affects associated with such experiences as attachment trauma, childhood abuse, and ego-alien sexual feelings. Secondly, therapists may attempt to evade feelings, such as fear and hatred, evoked by engaging with these dysregulated affects. Thirdly, we, as a society, may wish to evade acknowledging the reality of such trauma, abuse and sexual distress by hypothesizing that trans-identification is a biological issue, best treated medically. The author argues that the quality of evidence supporting the biomedical approach is extremely poor. This puts young trans people at risk of receiving potentially damaging medical treatment they may later seek to reverse or come to regret, while their underlying psychological issues remain unaddressed.","beziehungstrauma, detransition, dissoziation, gegenübertragung, geschlechtsdysphorie (gd), affect dérégulé, affetti alterati, attachment trauma, contratransferencia, contretransfert, controtransfert, countertransference, detransición, detransition, detransizione, disforia de género (gd), disforia di genere (dig), disociación, dissociation, dissociazione, dysphorie de genre, dysregulated affect, dysregulierter affekt, dé-transition, emoción desregulada, gender dysphoria (gd), homofobia internalizada, homophobie internalisée, internalised homophobia, internalisierte homophobie, omofobia interiorizzata, transgender, transgenre, transgénero, trauma de apego, trauma dell’attaccamento, traumatisme de l’attachement, гендерная дисфория (gd), детрансформация, дисрегулируемый аффект, диссоциация, интернализованная гомофобия, контрперенос, травма привязанности, трансгендер, 依恋创伤, 内化恐同, 去性别转换, 反移情, 失调的情绪, 性别焦虑症 (gd), 跨性别, 隔离",The Journal Of Analytical Psychology,paper author argu associ medic treatment constitut attempt evad experi psycholog distress occur three level firstli tran person may seek evad dysregul affect associ experi attach trauma childhood abus sexual feel secondli therapist may attempt evad feel fear hatr evok engag dysregul affect thirdli societi may wish evad acknowledg realiti trauma abus sexual distress hypothes biolog issu best treat medic author argu qualiti evid support biomed approach extrem poor put young tran peopl risk receiv potenti damag medic treatment may later seek revers come regret underli psycholog issu remain unaddress transgend medic attempt evad psycholog distress
93,Transforming Patient Compliance Research in an Era of Biomedicalization.,"The term patient noncompliance emerged in the 1970s as a tool for analyzing why people do not follow medical directives. Despite its early popularity, the term has languished in sociology while flourishing in biomedical arenas. It seems flaccid in a contemporary healthcare context as it overestimates physician authority and is tone-deaf to biomedicalization. I draw from sociological and anthropological traditions, as well as qualitative interviews with terminally ill patients ( N = 26) and their caregivers ( N = 16), to consider facets of a biomedicalized health experience and implications for an updated vision of compliance. First, pathways to care have proliferated under biomedicalization. With increased pathways comes increased need for understanding how treatment plans are socially constituted and assessed. Finally, increased complexity demands a more diverse vocabulary for understanding health related decisions. This paper is a call to sociologists to take the lead in transforming and updating this consequential concept.","adherence, biomedicalization, compliance, decision making, end of life",Journal Of Health And Social Behavior,term patient noncompli emerg tool analyz peopl follow medic direct despit earli popular term languish sociolog flourish biomed arena seem flaccid contemporari healthcar context overestim physician author biomedic draw sociolog anthropolog tradit well qualit interview termin ill patient n caregiv n consid facet biomedic health experi implic updat vision complianc first pathway care prolifer biomedic increas pathway come increas need understand treatment plan social constitut assess final increas complex demand diver vocabulari understand health relat decis paper call sociologist take lead transform updat consequenti concept transform patient complianc research era biomedic

Attitudes and knowledge among first-contact gatekeepers: systematic narrative review.,"Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common childhood disorder with international prevalence estimates of 5 % in childhood, yet significant evidence exists that far fewer children receive ADHD services. In many countries, ADHD is assessed and diagnosed in specialist mental health or neuro-developmental paediatric clinics, to which referral by General (Family) Practitioners (GPs) is required. In such 'gatekeeper' settings, where GPs act as a filter to diagnosis and treatment, GPs may either not recognise potential ADHD cases, or may be reluctant to refer. This study systematically reviews the literature regarding GPs' views of ADHD in such settings.","adhd, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, attitudes, family practice, gatekeepers, general practice, systematic review, training",Bmc Family Practice,attent deficit hyperact disord adhd common childhood disord intern preval estim childhood yet signific evid exist far fewer child receiv adhd servic mani countri adhd assess diagnos specialist mental health paediatr clinic referr gener famili practition gp requir set gp act filter diagnosi treatment gp may either recognis potenti adhd case may reluct refer studi systemat review literatur regard gp view adhd set gener practition know adhd attitud knowledg among gatekeep systemat narr review

97,Ethical concerns with online direct-to-consumer pharmaceutical companies.,"In recent years, online direct-to-consumer pharmaceutical companies have been created as an alternative method for individuals to get prescription medications. While these companies have noble aims to provide easier, more cost-effective access to medication, the fact that these companies both issue prescriptions (via entirely online medical reviews that can have no direct contact between physician and patient) as well as distribute and ship medications creates multiple ethical concerns. This paper aims to explore two in particular. First, this model creates conflicts of interest for the physicians hired by these companies to write prescriptions. Second, the lack of direct contact from physicians may be harmful to prospective patients. After analysing these issues, this paper argues that there ought to be further consideration for regulation and oversight for these companies.","health care economics, interests of health personnel/institutions, quality of health care",Journal Of Medical Ethics,recent year onlin pharmaceut compani creat altern method individu get prescript medic compani nobl aim provid easier access medic fact compani issu prescript via entir onlin medic review direct contact physician patient well distribut ship medic creat multipl ethic concern paper aim explor two particular first model creat conflict interest physician hire compani write prescript second lack direct contact physician may harm prospect patient analys issu paper argu ought consider regul oversight compani ethic concern onlin pharmaceut compani

100,Mindfulness meditation: do-it-yourself medicalization of every moment.,"This paper examines mindfulness as a popular and paradigmatic alternative healing practice within the context of contemporary medicalization trends. In recognition of the increasingly influential role popular media play in shaping ideas about illness and healing, what follows is a discursive analysis of bestselling mindfulness meditation self-help books and audio recordings by Jon Kabat-Zinn. The central and contradictory elements of this do-it-yourself healing practice as presented in these materials are best understood as aligned with medicalization trends for three principal reasons. First, mindfulness represents a significant expansion in the definition of disease beyond that advanced by mainstream medicine. Second, its etiological model intensifies the need for therapeutic surveillance and intervention. Third, by defining healing as a never-ending process, it permanently locates individuals within a disease-therapy cycle. In sum, the definition, cause, and treatment of disease as articulated by popular mindfulness resources expands the terrain of experiences and problems that are mediated by medical concepts. The case of mindfulness is a potent illustration of the changing character of medicalization itself.","alternative healing, complementary and alternative medicine (cam), discourse analysis, holistic care, medicalization, self-help",Social Science & Medicine (1982),paper examin mind popular paradigmat altern heal practic within context contemporari medic trend recognit increasingli influenti role popular medium play shape idea ill heal follow discurs analysi bestsel mind medit book audio record jon central contradictori element heal practic present materi best understood align medic trend three princip reason first mind repres signific expans definit diseas beyond advanc mainstream medicin second etiolog model intensifi need therapeut surveil intervent third defin heal process perman locat individu within cycl sum definit caus treatment diseas articul popular mind resourc expand terrain experi problem mediat medic concept case mind potent illustr chang charact medic mind medit medic everi moment
101,Large-scale evaluation of ion mobility spectrometry for the rapid detection of synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists in infused papers in prisons.,"Synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists (SCRAs), colloquially known as ""spice,"" are commonly used in prisons and enter establishments via the mail in the form of infused papers. Many prisons use benchtop ion mobility spectroscopy (IMS) instruments to screen mail and seized materials for the presence of SCRAs and other controlled substances. The selectivity and sensitivity of Rapiscan Itemiser<sup>®</sup> 3E and Itemiser<sup>®</sup> 4DN Ion Trap Mobility Spectroscopy™ (ITMS™) systems were evaluated using 21 SCRA reference standards. Some differences in the SCRA reduced mobility (K<sub>0</sub> ) values were observed between this study and those reported previously using IMS detection systems, particularly for cumyl and quinolinyl SCRAs (e.g., 5F-PB-22, Cumyl-4CN-BINACA, and 5F-Cumyl-PEGACLONE), although this was found to have little effect at an operational level. Operational reliability of the systems was evaluated by analyzing 392 paper and card samples with known drug content. ITMS™ system results (e.g., detect or nondetect) were in agreement with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis in up to 95% of samples tested. Overall, this study found the ITMS™ systems tested to be effective instruments when deployed for the rapid detection of SCRA-infused papers. Used effectively and with up-to-date substance libraries, they will help reduce the supply of SCRAs into prisons and identify emerging threats as they arise. Several emerging SCRAs (5F-MPP-PICA, 5F-EMB-PICA, and 4F-MDMB-BICA) were detected for the first time in Scottish prisons between May and August 2020 as a result of routine monitoring, and all were detected using the ITMS™ systems tested.","forensic chemistry, ion mobility spectrometry, new psychoactive substances, prison, synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists",Drug Testing And Analysis,synthet cannabinoid receptor agonist scra colloqui known spice commonli use prison enter establish via mail form infus paper mani prison use benchtop ion mobil spectroscopi im instrument screen mail seiz materi presenc scra control substanc select sensit rapiscan itemis sup itemis sup ion trap mobil system evalu use scra refer standard differ scra reduc mobil k sub valu observ studi report previous use im detect system particularli cumyl quinolinyl scra although found littl effect oper level oper reliabl system evalu analyz paper card sampl known drug content system result detect nondetect agreement ga spectrometri analysi sampl test overal studi found system test effect instrument deploy rapid detect paper use effect substanc librari help reduc suppli scra prison identifi emerg threat aris sever emerg scra detect first time scottish prison may august result routin monitor detect use system test evalu ion mobil spectrometri rapid detect synthet cannabinoid receptor agonist infus paper prison

Herein, we report the synthesis of novel 7-acryloxycoumarin (7-AC) through modiﬁcation reaction of 7-hydroxycoumarin with acryloyl chloride and its copolymerization with methyl methacrylate and glycidyl methacrylate to produce epoxy-functionalized ﬂuorescent polymer nanoparticles through emulsion polymerization. Chemical modification of cellulose pulp papers with the as-prepared fluorescent latex nanoparticles was also assessed. Spherical nanoparticles with average particle size of 40-93 nm and their diffusion into cellulosic fibers with excellent wetting and coating were monitored. Fluorimetery analysis demonstrated that immobilization of 7-AC into the hydrophobic acrylic copolymer substrate enhanced its emission intensity significantly with respect to its molecularly solution due to the elimination of unwanted environmental effects and non-radiative processes such as probable internal conversions. The obtained products exhibited intensified fluorescence emission with potentiality of being used in anticounterfeiting inks and security documents.","acrylic nanoparticles, cellulosic paper, coumarin, emulsion polymerization, fluorescence",Carbohydrate Polymers,fluoresc nanoparticl wide exploit probe cell track drug deliveri system secur devic nowaday herein report synthesi novel modiﬁc reaction acryloyl chlorid copolymer methyl methacryl glycidyl methacryl produc ﬂuoresc polym nanoparticl emuls polymer chemic modif cellulos pulp paper fluoresc latex nanoparticl also assess spheric nanoparticl averag particl size nm diffus cellulos fiber excel wet coat monitor fluorimeteri analysi demonstr immobil hydrophob acryl copolym substrat enhanc emiss intens significantli respect molecularli solut due elimin unwant environment effect process probabl intern convers obtain product exhibit intensifi fluoresc emiss potenti use anticounterfeit ink secur document anticounterfeit photoluminesc cellulos paper base fluoresc acryl copolym nanoparticl contain coumarin
104,[The psychiatrization and unpredictability of interpersonal violent behavior].,"The relationship between mental illness and violent behavior is a complex phenomenon. Scientific literature indicates that the presence of a mental disorder, even severe, is not sufficient, alone, to predict or motivate violent behavior, which seems to be more associated with other intermediate variables. The phenomenon of psychiatrization of violent behavior can be defined, from a psychiatric-forensic point of view, as the prejudicial and erroneous attribution to mental illness as a causal factor in relation to violent behavior. This phenomenon has consequences in psychiatric clinical practice, but also at the level of social stigmatization, management of organizational and economic resources, and the judicial system. In this paper, clinical criticalities related to the psychiatrization of violent behavior will be analyzed, including the need to differentiate clinical etiology and legal causality, predictability and avoidability, protective clinical factors and clinical risk factors, the limits of categorical psychiatric diagnosis, the need for specific victimological information, the criticalities of pharmacotherapy. Some forensic criticalities will also be analyzed, including errors in clinical and forensic methodology (psychiatrization of the symptom, prejudicial contamination, diagnostic overshadowing, legal causalization of protective and risk factors, the use of categorical diagnosis in the forensic field, the psychiatrization of non-pathological human experiences, the criminalization of the subject with mental disorder). In conclusion, it is highlighted that an individual can have a psychic disorder, even severe, but this disorder is not necessarily in a causal relationship with violent behavior. The lack of a causal relationship makes predictability of violent behavior difficult, even impossible depending on the case, both in the general population and in individuals with psychiatric disorders.",no keywords,Rivista Di Psichiatria,relationship mental ill violent behavior complex phenomenon scientif literatur indic presenc mental disord even sever suffici alon predict motiv violent behavior seem associ intermedi variabl phenomenon psychiatr violent behavior defin point view prejudici erron attribut mental ill causal factor relat violent behavior phenomenon consequ psychiatr clinic practic also level social stigmat manag organiz econom resourc judici system paper clinic critic relat psychiatr violent behavior analyz includ need differenti clinic etiolog legal causal predict avoid protect clinic factor clinic risk factor limit categor psychiatr diagnosi need specif victimolog inform critic pharmacotherapi forens critic also analyz includ error clinic forens methodolog psychiatr symptom prejudici contamin diagnost overshadow legal causal protect risk factor use categor diagnosi forens field psychiatr human experi crimin subject mental disord conclus highlight individu psychic disord even sever disord necessarili causal relationship violent behavior lack causal relationship make predict violent behavior difficult even imposs depend case gener popul individu psychiatr disord psychiatr unpredict interperson violent behavior
105,Paper waste and carbon emissions from oral contraceptive leaflets.,"Oral contraceptives (OC) are the most used form of contraception among women in the U.S. and Europe. Like other medications, their packaging must include patient information leaflets. This study quantifies the environmental impact of paper waste generated by these leaflets. We conducted an observational analysis, measuring the weight of leaflets, pills, and packaging components across various OC brands. Significant variations in leaflet weights were observed. On average, leaflets accounted for 55% of the package weight, while pills and blister dispensers represented only 32%. The mean weight of OC leaflets was 12.3 ± 5.5 grams (4.7-21.9 grams), leading to an estimated annual paper waste of 6,118.4 tons, 5,763.5 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions, and the use of approximately 146,841 trees for production. Standardizing leaflet weight to the lightest reported can reduce annual waste by 3780.5 tons of paper. This study highlights the substantial environmental cost of the waste generated from OC leaflets and proposes practical strategies to mitigate waste, including electronic leaflets and standardized packaging.

106,A scoping review of studies comparing the medication event monitoring system (MEMS) with alternative methods for measuring medication adherence.,"Different methods are available for measuring medication adherence. In this paper, we conducted a scoping review to identify and summarize evidence of all studies comparing the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS) with alternative methods for measuring medication adherence. A literature search was performed using the open database www.iAdherence.org that includes all original studies reporting findings from the MEMS. Papers comparing methods for measuring adherence to solid oral formulations were included. Data was extracted using a standardized extraction table. A total of 117 articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria, including 251 comparisons. Most frequent comparisons were against self-report (n = 119) and pill count (n = 59). Similar outcome measures were used in 210 comparisons (84%), among which 78 used dichotomous variables (adherent or not) and 132 used continuous measures (adherence expressed as percentage). Furthermore, 32% of all comparisons did not estimate adherence over the same coverage period and 44% of all comparisons did not use a statistical method or used a suboptimal one. Only eighty-seven (35%) comparisons had similar coverage periods, similar outcome measures and optimal statistical methods. Compared to MEMS, median adherence was grossly overestimated by 17% using self-report, by 8% using pill count and by 6% using rating. In conclusion, among all comparisons of MEMS versus alternative methods for measuring adherence, only a few used adequate comparisons in terms of outcome measures, coverage periods and statistical method. Researchers should therefore use stronger methodological frameworks when comparing measurement methods and be aware that non-electronic measures could lead to overestimation of medication adherence.","measurement methods, medication adherence, medication event monitoring system, methodology, pill count, self-report",British Journal Of Clinical Pharmacology,differ method avail measur medic adher paper conduct scope review identifi summar evid studi compar medic event monitor system mem altern method measur medic adher literatur search perform use open databas includ origin studi report find mem paper compar method measur adher solid oral formul includ data extract use standard extract tabl total articl fulfil inclus criterion includ comparison frequent comparison n pill count n similar outcom measur use comparison among use dichotom variabl adher use continu measur adher express percentag furthermor comparison estim adher coverag period comparison use statist method use suboptim one comparison similar coverag period similar outcom measur optim statist method compar mem median adher grossli overestim use use pill count use rate conclus among comparison mem versu altern method measur adher use adequ comparison term outcom measur coverag period statist method research therefor use stronger methodolog framework compar measur method awar measur could lead overestim medic adher scope review studi compar medic event monitor system mem altern method measur medic adher
107,Shape matters: The application of activity-based in vitro bioassays and chiral profiling to the pharmacological evaluation of synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists in drug-infused papers seized in prisons.,"Synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists (SCRAs) elicit many of their psychoactive effects via type-1 human cannabinoid (CB<sub>1</sub> ) receptors. Enantiomer pairs of eight tert-leucinate or valinate indole- and indazole-3-carboxamide SCRAs were synthesized and their CB<sub>1</sub> potency and efficacy assessed using an in vitro β-arrestin recruitment assay in a HEK239T stable cell system. A chiral high-performance liquid chromatography method with photodiode array and/or quadrupole time-of-flight-mass spectrometry detection (HPLC-PDA and HPLC-PDA-QToF-MS) was applied to 177 SCRA-infused paper samples seized in Scottish prisons between 2018 and 2020. In most samples, SCRAs were almost enantiopure (S)-enantiomer (>98% of total chromatographic peak area), although in some (n = 18), 2% to 16% of the (R)-enantiomer was detected. (S)-enantiomers are consistently more potent than (R)-enantiomers and often more efficacious. The importance of SCRA-CB<sub>1</sub> receptor interactions in the ""head"" or ""linked group"" moiety is demonstrated, with the conformation of the ""bulky"" tert-leucinate group greatly affecting potency (by up to a factor of 374), significantly greater than the difference observed between valinate SCRA enantiomers. (S)-MDMB-4en-PINACA, (S)-4F-MDMB-BINACA, and (S)-5F-MDMB-PICA are currently the most prevalent SCRAs in Scottish prisons, and all have similar high potency (EC<sub>50</sub> , 1-5 nM) and efficacy. Infused paper samples were compared using estimated intrinsic efficacy at the CB<sub>1</sub> receptor (EIE<sub>CB1</sub> ) to evaluate samples with variable SCRA content. Given their similar potency and efficacy, any variation in CB<sub>1</sub> receptor-mediated psychoactive effects are likely to derive from variation in dose, mode of use, pharmacokinetic differences, and individual factors affecting the user, rather than differences in the specific SCRA present.","activity-based bioassay, chiral profiling, new psychoactive substances, prisons, synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists",Drug Testing And Analysis,synthet cannabinoid receptor agonist scra elicit mani psychoact effect via human cannabinoid cb sub receptor enantiom pair eight valin scra synthes cb sub potenc efficaci assess use vitro recruit assay stabl cell system chiral liquid chromatographi method photodiod array quadrupol spectrometri detect appli paper sampl seiz scottish prison sampl scra almost enantiopur total chromatograph peak area although n r detect consist potent r often efficaci import sub receptor interact head link group moieti demonstr conform bulki group greatli affect potenc factor significantli greater differ observ valin scra enantiom current preval scra scottish prison similar high potenc ec sub nm efficaci infus paper sampl compar use estim intrins efficaci cb sub receptor eie sub evalu sampl variabl scra content given similar potenc efficaci variat cb sub psychoact effect like deriv variat dose mode use pharmacokinet differ individu factor affect user rather differ specif scra present shape matter applic vitro bioassay chiral profil pharmacolog evalu synthet cannabinoid receptor agonist paper seiz prison

110,Methods and strategies for assessing uncontrolled drug-drug interactions in population pharmacokinetic analyses: results from the International Society of Pharmacometrics (ISOP) Working Group.,"The purpose of this work was to present a consolidated set of guidelines for the analysis of uncontrolled concomitant medications (ConMed) as a covariate and potential perpetrator in population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) analyses. This white paper is the result of an industry-academia-regulatory collaboration. It is the recommendation of the working group that greater focus be given to the analysis of uncontrolled ConMeds as part of a PopPK analysis of Phase 2/3 data to ensure that the resulting outcome in the PopPK analysis can be viewed as reliable. Other recommendations include: (1) collection of start and stop date and clock time, as well as dose and frequency, in Case Report Forms regarding ConMed administration schedule; (2) prespecification of goals and the methods of analysis, (3) consideration of alternate models, other than the binary covariate model, that might more fully characterize the interaction between perpetrator and victim drug, (4) analysts should consider whether the sample size, not the percent of subjects taking a ConMed, is sufficient to detect a ConMed effect if one is present and to consider the correlation with other covariates when the analysis is conducted, (5) grouping of ConMeds should be based on mechanism (e.g., PGP-inhibitor) and not drug class (e.g., beta-blocker), and (6) when reporting the results in a publication, all details related to the ConMed analysis should be presented allowing the reader to understand the methods and be able to appropriately interpret the results.","concomitant, covariate modeling, drug interactions, medications, population pharmacokinetics",Journal Of Pharmacokinetics And Pharmacodynamics,purpos work present consolid set guidelin analysi uncontrol concomit medic conm covari potenti perpetr popul pharmacokinet poppk analys white paper result collabor recommend work group greater focu given analysi uncontrol conm part poppk analysi phase data ensur result outcom poppk analysi view reliabl recommend includ collect start stop date clock time well dose frequenc case report form regard conm administr schedul prespecif goal method analysi consider altern model binari covari model might fulli character interact perpetr victim drug analyst consid whether sampl size percent subject take conm suffici detect conm effect one present consid correl covari analysi conduct group conm base mechan drug class report result public detail relat conm analysi present allow reader understand method abl appropri interpret result method strategi assess uncontrol interact popul pharmacokinet analys result intern societi pharmacometr isop work group
111,How Do Medicalization and Rescue Fantasy Prevent Healthy Dying?,"Before antibiotics, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and life-sustaining technologies, humans had little choice about the timing and manner of their deaths. Today, the medicalization of death has enabled patients to delay death, prolonging their living and dying. New technology, the influence of the media, and medical professionals themselves have together transformed dying from a natural part of the human experience into a medical crisis from which a patient must be rescued, often through the aggressive extension of life or through its premature termination. In this paper, we examine problematic forms of rescue medicine and suggest the need to rethink medicalized dying within the context of medicine's orientation to health and wholeness.",no keywords,Ama Journal Of Ethics,antibiot cardiopulmonari resuscit cpr technolog human littl choic time manner death today medic death enabl patient delay death prolong live die new technolog influenc medium medic profession togeth transform die natur part human experi medic crisi patient must rescu often aggress extens life prematur termin paper examin problemat form rescu medicin suggest need rethink medic die within context medicin orient health whole medic rescu fantasi prevent healthi die

114,Impact of Porous Matrices and Concentration by Lyophilization on Cell-Free Expression.,"Cell-free expression systems have drawn increasing attention as a tool to achieve complex biological functions outside of the cell. Several applications of the technology involve the delivery of functionality to challenging environments, such as field-forward diagnostics or point-of-need manufacturing of pharmaceuticals. To achieve these goals, cell-free reaction components are preserved using encapsulation or lyophilization methods, both of which often involve an embedding of components in porous matrices like paper or hydrogels. Previous work has shown a range of impacts of porous materials on cell-free expression reactions. Here, we explored a panel of 32 paperlike materials and 5 hydrogel materials for the impact on reaction performance. The screen included a tolerance to lyophilization for reaction systems based on both cell lysates and purified expression components. For paperlike materials, we found that (1) materials based on synthetic polymers were mostly incompatible with cell-free expression, (2) lysate-based reactions were largely insensitive to the matrix for cellulosic and microfiber materials, and (3) purified systems had an improved performance when lyophilized in cellulosic but not microfiber matrices. The impact of hydrogel materials ranged from completely inhibitory to a slight enhancement. The exploration of modulating the rehydration volume of lyophilized reactions yielded reaction speed increases using an enzymatic colorimetric reporter of up to twofold with an optimal ratio of 2:1 lyophilized reaction to rehydration volume for the lysate system and 1.5:1 for the purified system. The effect was independent of the matrices assessed. Testing with a fluorescent nonenzymatic reporter and no matrix showed similar improvements in both yields and reaction speeds for the lysate system and yields but not reaction speeds for the purified system. We finally used these observations to show an improved performance of two sensors that span reaction types, matrix, and reporters. In total, these results should enhance efforts to develop field-forward applications of cell-free expression systems.","cell-free, cell-free expression, cell-free sensors",Acs Synthetic Biology,express system drawn increas attent tool achiev complex biolog function outsid cell sever applic technolog involv deliveri function challeng environ diagnost manufactur pharmaceut achiev goal reaction compon preserv use encapsul lyophil method often involv embed compon porou matric like paper hydrogel previou work shown rang impact porou materi express reaction explor panel paperlik materi hydrogel materi impact reaction perform screen includ toler lyophil reaction system base cell lysat purifi express compon paperlik materi found materi base synthet polym mostli incompat express reaction larg insensit matrix cellulos microfib materi purifi system improv perform lyophil cellulos microfib matric impact hydrogel materi rang complet inhibitori slight enhanc explor modul rehydr volum lyophil reaction yield reaction speed increas use enzymat colorimetr report twofold optim ratio lyophil reaction rehydr volum lysat system purifi system effect independ matric assess test fluoresc nonenzymat report matrix show similar improv yield reaction speed lysat system yield reaction speed purifi system final use observ show improv perform two sensor span reaction type matrix report total result enhanc effort develop applic express system impact porou matric concentr lyophil express
115,Medicalizing to demedicalize: lactation consultants and the (de)medicalization of breastfeeding.,"This paper uses the domain of breastfeeding in the U.S. and the work of International Board Certified Lactation Consultants to refine the concept of medicalization-demedicalization. Given lactation consultants' origins and current role in maternity care, they provide a unique lens on these processes because they are positioned at the crossroads of medicalization and demedicalization. Using 150 h of ethnographic observation and 39 interviews conducted between 2008 and 2012, I identify aspects of medicalization-demedicalization in the work of lactation consultants according to four dimensions: medical definition, medical control, pathology, and medical technology. Lactation consultants work to demedicalize breastfeeding by challenging the construction of breastfeeding pathology and limiting intervention. At the same time, they hold a position of medical control and medicalize breastfeeding by reinforcing a medical definition and using medical technology to treat breastfeeding problems. However, lactation consultants are not only working toward demedicalization and medicalization simultaneously, but are also medicalizing to demedicalize. Their position of medical control over breastfeeding provides them with a certain measure of authority that they can use in their efforts to depathologize breastfeeding and limit medical intervention. These findings build upon previous research that has identified cases of medicalization and demedicalization occurring simultaneously and draw attention to the need for an understanding of medicalization-demedicalization as a continuous process. Furthermore, the concept of ""medicalizing to demedicalize"" provides a novel contribution to the literature.","breastfeeding, demedicalization, ethnography, medicalization, usa",Social Science & Medicine (1982),paper use domain breastfeed work intern board certifi lactat consult refin concept given lactat consult origin current role matern care provid uniqu len process posit crossroad medic demedic use h ethnograph observ interview conduct identifi aspect work lactat consult accord four dimens medic definit medic control patholog medic technolog lactat consult work demedic breastfeed challeng construct breastfeed patholog limit intervent time hold posit medic control medic breastfeed reinforc medic definit use medic technolog treat breastfeed problem howev lactat consult work toward demedic medic simultan also medic demedic posit medic control breastfeed provid certain measur author use effort depatholog breastfeed limit medic intervent find build upon previou research identifi case medic demedic occur simultan draw attent need understand continu process furthermor concept medic demedic provid novel contribut literatur medic demedic lactat consult de medic breastfeed

Building on sociological literature related to medicalisation, this paper argues that the lived experience of medicalisation is a non-linear, complex process whereby individual engagement with medical authority is both empowering and constraining in the lives of trans people. Inductive qualitative analysis of 158 hours of participant observation and 33 in-depth interviews with members of a transgender community organisation revealed that transgender individuals (i) reject a medical frame for gender dysphoria, (ii) embrace and stress the importance of gender-affirming medical technologies for individual identity development and social interaction and (iii) strategically reintroduce medical logics and embrace medical authority in order to facilitate medical and social recognition, validation and acceptance.","ethnography, gender, medicalisation",Sociology Of Health & Illness,articl use ethnograph method explor transgend peopl engag medicalis transgend experi context purview american psychiatr associ build sociolog literatur relat medicalis paper argu live experi medicalis complex process wherebi individu engag medic author empow constrain live tran peopl induct qualit analysi hour particip observ interview member transgend commun organis reveal transgend individu reject medic frame gender dysphoria ii embrac stress import medic technolog individu ident develop social interact iii strateg reintroduc medic logic embrac medic author order facilit medic social recognit valid accept reject refram reintroduc tran peopl strateg engag medicalis gender dysphoria
117,Rapid detection of NBOME's and other NPS on blotter papers by direct ATR-FTIR spectrometry.,"Blotter paper is among the most common forms of consumption of new psychotropic substances (NPS), formerly referred as designer drugs. In many cases, users are misled to believe they are taking LSD when, in fact, they are taking newer and less known drugs like the NBOMEs or other substituted phenethylamines. We report our findings in quick testing of blotter papers for illicit substances like NBOMEs and other NPS by taking ATR-FTIR spectra directly from blotters seized on the streets, without any sample preparation. Both sides (front and back) of each blotter were tested. Collected data were analyzed by single- and multi-component spectral matching and submitted to chemometric discriminant analysis. Our results showed that, on 66.7% of the cases analyzed, seized blotters contained one or more types of NBOMEs, confirming the growing presence of this novel substances on the market. Matching IR signals were detected on both or just one side of the blotters and showed variable strength. Although no quantitative analysis was made, detection of these substances by the proposed approach serves as indication of variable and possibly higher dosages per blotter when compared to LSD, which showed to be below the detection limit of the applied method. Blotters containing a mescaline-like compound, later confirmed by GC-MS and LC-MS to be MAL (methallylescaline), a substance very similar to mescaline, were detected among the samples tested. Validity of direct ATR-FTIR testing was confirmed by checking the obtained results against independent GC-MS or LC-MS results for the same cases/samples.","atr-ftir, blotter papers, discriminant analysis, mal (methallylescaline), nbome, nps (new psychotropic substances)",Forensic Science International,blotter paper among common form consumpt new psychotrop substanc np formerli refer design drug mani case user misl believ take lsd fact take newer less known drug like nbome substitut phenethylamin report find quick test blotter paper illicit substanc like nbome np take spectrum directli blotter seiz street without sampl prepar side front back blotter test collect data analyz spectral match submit chemometr discrimin analysi result show case analyz seiz blotter contain one type nbome confirm grow presenc novel substanc market match ir signal detect one side blotter show variabl strength although quantit analysi made detect substanc propos approach serv indic variabl possibl higher dosag per blotter compar lsd show detect limit appli method blotter contain compound later confirm mal methallylescalin substanc similar mescalin detect among sampl test valid direct test confirm check obtain result independ result rapid detect nbome np blotter paper direct spectrometri
118,Paper-Based Enzyme Competition Assay for Detecting Falsified β-Lactam Antibiotics.,"Falsified and substandard antibiotics are a growing worldwide problem that leads to increased patient mortality and decreased trust in healthcare, and contributes to antimicrobial resistance. Monitoring falsified antibiotics is difficult because most falsified pharmaceuticals are most commonly found in developing countries, where detecting the active ingredient is difficult due to lack of access to complex instrumentation. Herein, we describe the development and optimization of a microfluidic paper-based analytical device (μPAD) to detect the active ingredient in the most falsified class of antibiotics, β-lactams. The assay is based on enzyme competition, making it the first demonstrated competitive enzyme assay reported in paper-based devices. The assay uses nitrocefin, a chromogenic substrate, to compete with β-lactam antibiotics in a reaction with β-lactamase. A yellow color indicates legitimate drugs, while a color change from yellow to red indicates falsified drugs. In addition to testing for the active ingredient, another section of the device was added to test the sample pH to further verify results and identify common falsified ingredients like aspirin or baking soda. Calibration curves for four different antibiotics, including cefazolin, have been generated making it the first paper-based device capable of detecting both cephalosporin and penicillin antibiotics. The μPAD has also been tested with common falsified ingredients and four antibiotics in tablet or injectable form, demonstrating its potential for in-field falsified antibiotic testing.","beta-lactam antibiotics, beta-lactamase, enzyme competition, falsified antibiotics, microfluidic paper-based analytical devices, nitrocefin, substandard antibiotics",Acs Sensors,falsifi substandard antibiot grow worldwid problem lead increas patient mortal decreas trust healthcar contribut antimicrobi resist monitor falsifi antibiot difficult falsifi pharmaceut commonli found develop countri detect activ ingredi difficult due lack access complex instrument herein describ develop optim microfluid analyt devic μpad detect activ ingredi falsifi class antibiot assay base enzym competit make first demonstr competit enzym assay report devic assay use nitrocefin chromogen substrat compet antibiot reaction yellow color indic legitim drug color chang yellow red indic falsifi drug addit test activ ingredi anoth section devic ad test sampl ph verifi result identifi common falsifi ingredi like aspirin bake soda calibr curv four differ antibiot includ cefazolin gener make first devic capabl detect cephalosporin penicillin antibiot μpad also test common falsifi ingredi four antibiot tablet inject form demonstr potenti falsifi antibiot test enzym competit assay detect falsifi antibiot

122,Could Moral Enhancement Interventions be Medically Indicated?,"This paper explores the position that moral enhancement interventions could be medically indicated (and so considered therapeutic) in cases where they provide a remedy for a lack of empathy, when such a deficit is considered pathological. In order to argue this claim, the question as to whether a deficit of empathy could be considered to be pathological is examined, taking into account the difficulty of defining illness and disorder generally, and especially in the case of mental health. Following this, Psychopathy and a fictionalised mental disorder (Moral Deficiency Disorder) are explored with a view to consider moral enhancement techniques as possible treatments for both conditions. At this juncture, having asserted and defended the position that moral enhancement interventions could, under certain circumstances, be considered medically indicated, this paper then goes on to briefly explore some of the consequences of this assertion. First, it is acknowledged that this broadening of diagnostic criteria in light of new interventions could fall foul of claims of medicalisation. It is then briefly noted that considering moral enhancement technologies to be akin to therapies in certain circumstances could lead to ethical and legal consequences and questions, such as those regarding regulation, access, and even consent.","bioethics, empathy, enhancement, moral enhancement, moral therapy, neuroethics",Health Care Analysis : Hca : Journal Of Health Philosophy And Policy,paper explor posit moral enhanc intervent could medic indic consid therapeut case provid remedi lack empathi deficit consid patholog order argu claim question whether deficit empathi could consid patholog examin take account difficulti defin ill disord gener especi case mental health follow psychopathi fictionalis mental disord moral defici disord explor view consid moral enhanc techniqu possibl treatment condit junctur assert defend posit moral enhanc intervent could certain circumst consid medic indic paper goe briefli explor consequ assert first acknowledg broaden diagnost criterion light new intervent could fall foul claim medicalis briefli note consid moral enhanc technolog akin therapi certain circumst could lead ethic legal consequ question regard regul access even consent could moral enhanc intervent medic indic
123,Comparative study of electrospun crystal-based and composite-based drug nano depots.,"Complex nanostructures are increasingly becoming important in the development of novel functional nanomaterials. Nano drug depots, characterized by core-shell structures with core drug reservoirs, are drawing increasing attention because of its potential applications in furnishing drug-sustained release profiles. In the present study, two kinds of nano drug depots, one containing a crystal drug reservoir and the other having a medicated composite drug reservoir, were prepared through modified triaxial electrospinning. Their drug-sustained release performances were compared in terms of initial burst release, middle linear release, and the late tailing off release. Although both depots had a linear morphology, clear core-shell nanostructures and the same cellulose acetate shell layer, they provided considerably different tailing off release performances, and thus different sustained release profiles. The composite-based drug depots showed a smaller tailing off drug amount of 2.2%, a shorter time period of 12 h, and a better zero-order controlled release kinetics in general than the crystal-based drug depots, whose tailing off amount was 9.3% over a time period of 36 h. The mechanism was proposed, which had a close relationship with the state of drug in the core reservoir. The present protocols open a new way for producing medicated structural nanomaterials.","core-shell nanofibers, drug depots, nano composite, nano crystal, sustained release, triaxial electrospinning","Materials Science & Engineering.

124,Choir Boy: Trans Vocal Performance and the De-Pathologization of Transition.,"This paper will examine Choir Boy (2005), a trans coming-of-age novel by Charlie Anders, to disrupt historically rooted medical narratives of gender transition. Through a disability studies lens, this paper locates vocal performance as a means of speaking back to gatekeeping practices held in place by medical authorities since the inception of transsexuality as a classificatory category. Offering imaginative alternatives to ""wrong body"" diagnostics, this analysis places cultural texts in conversation with disability theory to reframe the trans self as a singing body that cannot be reduced to normalizing biomedical practices. Choir Boy frames vocal performance as a mode of gender expression and as a survival strategy against violence. The trans counter-narratives offered by Anders resist the medicalization of trans bodies and the classification of some bodies as not ""trans enough"" to qualify for transition. Choir Boy locates vocal performance and not binary gender identification as impetus for transition, thereby advocating for trans self-determination over medical access.","gatekeeping, gender, queer, trans, transition",The Journal Of Medical Humanities,paper examin choir boy tran novel charli ander disrupt histor root medic narr gender transit disabl studi len paper locat vocal perform mean speak back gatekeep practic held place medic author sinc incept transsexu classificatori categori offer imagin altern wrong bodi diagnost analysi place cultur text convers disabl theori refram tran self sing bodi reduc normal biomed practic choir boy frame vocal perform mode gender express surviv strategi violenc tran offer ander resist medic tran bodi classif bodi tran enough qualifi transit choir boy locat vocal perform binari gender identif impetu transit therebi advoc tran medic access choir boy tran vocal perform transit
125,"Not Sick: Liberal, Trans, and Crip Feminist Critiques of Medicalization.","Medicalization occurs when an aspect of embodied humanity is scrutinized by the medical industry, claimed as pathological, and subsumed under medical intervention. Numerous critiques of medicalization appear in academic literature, often put forth by bioethicists who use a variety of ""lenses"" to make their case. Feminist critiques of medicalization raise the concerns of the politically disenfranchised, thus seeking to protect women-particularly natal sex women-from medical exploitation. This article will focus on three feminist critiques of medicalization, which offer an alternative narrative of sickness and health. I will first briefly describe the philosophical origins of medicalization. Then, I will present three feminist critiques of medicalization. Liberal feminism, trans feminism, and crip feminism tend to regard Western medicine with a hermeneutics of suspicion and draw out potential harms of medicalization of reproductive sexuality, gender, and disability, respectively. While neither these branches of feminism-nor their critiques-are homogenous, they provide much-needed commentaries on phallocentric medicine. I will conclude the paper by arguing for the continual need for feminist critiques of medicalization, using uterus transplantation as a relevant case study.","bioethics, crip theory, disability studies, feminism, gay and lesbian studies, medicalization, queer bioethics, reproductive ethics, transgender",Journal Of Bioethical Inquiry,medic occur aspect embodi human scrutin medic industri claim patholog subsum medic intervent numer critiqu medic appear academ literatur often put forth bioethicist use varieti lens make case feminist critiqu medic rais concern polit disenfranchis thu seek protect natal sex medic exploit articl focu three feminist critiqu medic offer altern narr sick health first briefli describ philosoph origin medic present three feminist critiqu medic liber femin tran femin crip femin tend regard western medicin hermeneut suspicion draw potenti harm medic reproduct sexual gender disabl respect neither branch homogen provid commentari phallocentr medicin conclud paper argu continu need feminist critiqu medic use uteru transplant relev case studi sick liber tran crip feminist critiqu medic

127,Interaction order and the labeling of disorder: How parents mobilize personal knowledge in the clinic to resist medicalization of their children's behavior.,"This paper examines how parents of children diagnosed with autism resist the medicalization of their children's behavior. Drawing on video and ethnographic data collected over four years of fieldwork at a clinic for developmental disorders, the paper distinguishes two orders of practice - that of the clinic and that of the family - and argues that behavior which is interpreted as disordered in the clinic may be seen as ordinary in the home. These different interpretations reflect and renew distinct orders of sensemaking in the clinic and home, and parents may mobilize familial knowledge of the child to counter the medicalization of specific behavior patterns, even where they otherwise accept an autism diagnosis. In showing how medicalization and labelling are achieved and resisted in the mundane details of social interaction, the paper contributes to studies of diagnosis, disability, and deviance. Further, the myriad ways parents and clinicians contest which regions of a child's behavior get medicalized - i.e. which behavioral patterns are labeled disordered - present a challenge to binary conceptions of medicalization, recommending instead a more nuanced model of medicalization as a multi-dimensional continuum: more or less, rather than either-or.","autism, conversation analysis, ethnomethodology, interaction, medicalization, resistance",Social Science & Medicine (1982),paper examin parent child diagnos autism resist medic child behavior draw video ethnograph data collect four year fieldwork clinic development disord paper distinguish two order practic clinic famili argu behavior interpret disord clinic may seen ordinari home differ interpret reflect renew distinct order sensemak clinic home parent may mobil famili knowledg child counter medic specif behavior pattern even otherwis accept autism diagnosi show medic label achiev resist mundan detail social interact paper contribut studi diagnosi disabl devianc myriad way parent clinician contest region child behavior get medic behavior pattern label disord present challeng binari concept medic recommend instead nuanc model medic continuum less rather interact order label disord parent mobil person knowledg clinic resist medic child behavior

It demonstrates the importance of social networks and interdisciplinary work, particularly across the medical-social science divide and including cross-cultural perspectives, argues that the study of reproduction has facilitated methodological development within the social sciences, and suggests that childbirth remains on the periphery of mainstream sociological concerns.","childbirth, health policy, medicalisation, midwifery, obstetrics/obstetricians, patient and public engagement",Sociology Of Health & Illness,sociolog childbirth emerg larg result influenc outsid sociolog includ femin matern care activ increas medicalis childbirth health care paper use author sociolog map journey four decad childbirth research demonstr import social network interdisciplinari work particularli across scienc divid includ perspect argu studi reproduct facilit methodolog develop within social scienc suggest childbirth remain peripheri mainstream sociolog concern sociolog childbirth autobiograph journey four decad research

This paper aims to determine and explain disparities in ADHD prevalence and medication use among school-aged children in two distinct school systems, in Flanders (Belgium) and Québec (Canada). We present detailed descriptive and comparative analyses of data from 35 schools, 114 teachers, and 1046 parents (children) that were collected as part of a comparative international project. The data concern teacher and parent suspicions, teachers' ratings of ADHD-related behaviors in children, teachers' views of medication use, and teachers' beliefs about ADHD. The results show that, compared with Flanders, Québec had significantly more children diagnosed with ADHD and more frequent suspicions of ADHD in children by teachers and parents.

Here, the quantitative detection of biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG (system one) and rabbit IgG (system two) antibodies via colorimetric analysis is detailed. In both systems, antibody is spotted on the detection site and subjected to a series of washes, addition of streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (Strep-ALP) (system 1) or alkaline phosphatase (ALP)-conjugated secondary antibody (system 2), and colorimetric substrate. The devices are scanned and analyzed yielding a correlation between inverse yellow (or purple) intensity. For system one, a linear range of detection at low concentrations of streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (Strep-ALP) was observed befire the enzyme reached a V<sub>max</sub> . At higher concentrations of Strep-ALP, saturation is achieved for both the μTPAD and μFAD devices. For system two, the IC<sub>50</sub> values obtained for the non-trifurcated and trifurcated μTADs were determined to be 180.2 fmol/zone and 133.8 fmol/zone, respectively. The IC<sub>50</sub> value was demonstrated to be 1034 fmol/zone and 208.6 fmol/zone for the μTPADs and μFADs, respectively. For all devices the lowest concentration of Strep-ALP or rabbit IgG used in the assay was 3.75 × 10<sup>-4</sup>  mg/mL and 0.7 fmol/zone, respectively. The development of this technology should further facilitate the use of these platforms for ELISA to detect and quantitate antibodies.","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, microfluidic fabric-based analytical device, microfluidic thread-based analytical device, microfluidics, microfluidics thread/paper-based analytical device",Electrophoresis,paper describ immunosorb assay elisa util microfluid analyt devic μtpad microfluid analyt devic μfad microfluid analyt devic μtad quantit detect biotinyl goat igg system one rabbit igg system two antibodi via colorimetr analysi detail system antibodi spot detect site subject seri wash addit phosphatas system alkalin phosphatas alp secondari antibodi system colorimetr substrat devic scan analyz yield correl invers yellow purpl intens system one linear rang detect low concentr phosphatas observ befir enzym reach v sub max higher concentr satur achiev μtpad μfad devic system two ic sub valu obtain trifurc μtad determin respect ic sub valu demonstr μtpad μfad respect devic lowest concentr rabbit igg use assay sup respect develop technolog facilit use platform elisa detect quantit antibodi immunosorb assay elisa base thread paper fabric

133,What is wrong with 'being a pill-taker'? The special case of statins.,"In an interview study of decision-making about statins, many participants said they took pills regularly, yet described themselves as 'not really pill-takers'. This paper explores this paradox and its implications. The practice of pill-taking itself can constitute a challenge to the presentation of moral adequacy, beyond the potential for rendering stigmatised illnesses visible. Meeting this challenge involves a complex process of calibrating often-conflicting moral imperatives: to be concerned, but not too concerned, over one's health; to be informed, but not over-informed; and deferential but not over-deferential to medical expertise. This calibration reflects a broader tension between rival tropes: embracing medical progress and resisting medicalisation. Participants who take statins present them as unquestionably necessary; 'needing' pills, as opposed to choosing to take them, serves as a defence against the devalued identity of being a pill-taker. However, needing to take statins offers an additional threat to identity, because taking statins is widely perceived to be an alternative strategy to 'choosing a healthy lifestyle'. This perception underpins a responsibilising health promotion discourse that shapes and complicates the work participants do to avoid presenting themselves as 'pill-takers'. The salience of this discourse should be acknowledged where discussions of medicalisation use statins as an example.","adherence, cardiovascular disease, healthism, identity, medicalisation, surveillance medicine",Sociology Of Health & Illness,interview studi statin mani particip said took pill regularli yet describ realli paper explor paradox implic practic constitut challeng present moral adequaci beyond potenti render stigmatis ill visibl meet challeng involv complex process calibr moral imper concern concern one health inform deferenti medic expertis calibr reflect broader tension rival trope embrac medic progress resist medicalis particip take statin present unquestion necessari pill oppos choos take serv defenc devalu ident howev need take statin offer addit threat ident take statin wide perceiv altern strategi healthi lifestyl percept underpin responsibilis health promot discours shape complic work particip avoid present salienc discours acknowledg discus medicalis use statin exampl wrong special case statin

136,Molecular imprinting within hydrogels II: progress and analysis of the field.,"In the past decade, there has been an exponential increase in the number of papers describing molecular imprinting in hydrogels, a technique which creates memory for template molecules within a flexible macromolecular structure. Macromolecular memory or structural plasticity of polymer chains is a superior description of weakly crosslinked imprinted networks since significant flexibility can occur within the polymer chains. The focus of this article is to review and highlight work in the field describing the imprinting strategy within hydrogels and associated challenges, characterization methods of imprinted gels, current and potential translational applications, and future strategies and directions. This paper also describes ways to improve binding parameter efficacy and presents significant areas of opportunity to further describe, characterize, and understand imprinted gels. An analysis of the literature indicates that imprinting in hydrogels leads to significant improvements in template affinity, capacity, and selectivity over non-templated hydrogels for a number of templates such as ions, small and moderate molecular weight molecules, proteins, viruses, DNA, and cells. However, the influence of imprinting on the transport of template is much more complex, with little attention of most studies to structural analysis or discussion of the gel porosity/tortuosity in the control of template transport. Responsive, intelligent imprinted hydrogels are also highlighted that exhibit reversibly modulated template binding and transport. It is clear that this field has transitioned from infancy and is leading to breakthroughs in a number of areas such as controlled and modulated drug delivery, diagnostic sensors, and separation. For example in drug delivery, imprinting can lead to delayed transport and provides further control of therapeutic transport through the macromolecular structure as well as optimizes the number of therapeutic molecules to polymer chains.",no keywords,International Journal Of Pharmaceutics,past decad exponenti increas number paper describ molecular imprint hydrogel techniqu creat memori templat molecul within flexibl macromolecular structur macromolecular memori structur plastic polym chain superior descript weakli crosslink imprint network sinc signific flexibl occur within polym chain focu articl review highlight work field describ imprint strategi within hydrogel associ challeng character method imprint gel current potenti translat applic futur strategi direct paper also describ way improv bind paramet efficaci present signific area opportun describ character understand imprint gel analysi literatur indic imprint hydrogel lead signific improv templat affin capac select hydrogel number templat ion small moder molecular weight molecul protein virus dna cell howev influenc imprint transport templat much complex littl attent studi structur analysi discus gel control templat transport respons intellig imprint hydrogel also highlight exhibit revers modul templat bind transport clear field transit infanc lead breakthrough number area control modul drug deliveri diagnost sensor separ exampl drug deliveri imprint lead delay transport provid control therapeut transport macromolecular structur well optim number therapeut molecul polym chain molecular imprint within hydrogel ii progress analysi field
137,Pressure-Sensitive Adhesive Combined with Paper Spray Mass Spectrometry for Low-Cost Collection and Analysis of Drug Residues.,"Illicit drug use causes over half a million deaths worldwide every year. Drugs of abuse are commonly smuggled through customs and border checkpoints and, increasingly, through parcel delivery services. Improved methods for detection of trace drug residues from surfaces are needed. Such methods should be robust, fieldable, sensitive, and capable of detecting a wide range of drugs. In this work, commercially produced paper with a pressure-sensitive adhesive coating was utilized for the collection and analysis of trace drug residues by paper spray mass spectrometry (MS). This modified substrate was used to combine sample collection of drug residues from surfaces with rapid detection using a single paper spray ticket. The all-in-one ticket was used to probe different surfaces commonly encountered in forensic work including clothing, cardboard, glass, concrete, asphalt, and aluminum. A total of 10 drugs (acetyl fentanyl, fentanyl, clonazolam, cocaine, heroin, ketamine, methamphetamine, methylone, U-47700, and XLR-11) were evaluated and found to be detectable in the picogram range using a benchtop mass spectrometer and in the low nanogram range using a portable ion trap MS.

138,Medicalising short children with growth hormone? Ethical considerations of the underlying sociocultural aspects.,"In 2003, the Food and Drug Administration approved the use of growth hormone treatment for idiopathic short stature children, i.e. children shorter than average due to an unknown medical cause. Given the absence of any pathological conditions, this decision has been contested as a case of medicalisation. The aim of this paper is to broaden the debate over the reasons for and against the treatment, to include considerations of the sociocultural phenomenon of the medicalisation of short stature, by means of a critical understanding of the concept of medicalisation. After defining my understanding of medicalisation and describing both the treatment and the condition of idiopathic short stature, I will problematise two fundamental issues: the medical/non-medical distinction and the debate about the goals of medicine. I will analyse them, combining perspectives of bioethics, medical sociology, philosophy of medicine and medical literature, and I will suggest that there are different levels of normativity of medicalisation. Ultimately, this study shows that: (1) the definition of idiopathic short stature, focusing only on actual height measurement, does not provide enough information to assess the need for treatment or not; (2) the analysis of the goals of medicine should be broadened to include justifications for the treatment; (3) the use of growth hormone for idiopathic short stature involves strong interests from different stakeholders. While the treatment might be beneficial for some children, it is necessary to be vigilant about possible misconduct at different levels of medicalisation.","bioethics, children, endocrinology, growth hormone treatment, medical sociology, medicalisation, philosophy of medicine","Medicine, Health Care, And Philosophy",food drug administr approv use growth hormon treatment idiopath short statur child child shorter averag due unknown medic caus given absenc patholog condit decis contest case medicalis aim paper broaden debat reason treatment includ consider sociocultur phenomenon medicalis short statur mean critic understand concept medicalis defin understand medicalis describ treatment condit idiopath short statur problematis two fundament issu distinct debat goal medicin analys combin perspect bioethic medic sociolog philosophi medicin medic literatur suggest differ level norm medicalis ultim studi show definit idiopath short statur focus actual height measur provid enough inform assess need treatment analysi goal medicin broaden includ justif treatment use growth hormon idiopath short statur involv strong interest differ stakehold treatment might benefici child necessari vigil possibl misconduct differ level medicalis medicalis short child growth hormon ethic consider underli sociocultur aspect
139,Fabrication of water/oil-resistant paper by nanocellulose stabilized Pickering emulsion and chitosan.,"Developing plastic/fluorine/silicon-free and degradable water/oil-resistant coatings for paper-based packaging materials to replace disposable plastic products is a very effective way to solve the problem of 'white pollution' or microplastics pollution. A novel water/oil-resistant coating was developed by alkyl ketene dimer (AKD)-based Pickering emulsion and chitosan in this work. Cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) were used as a stabilizing solid for AKD emulsion, with the addition of chitosan as an oil-resistance agent. The coating provides excellent hydrophobicity, water/oil resistance as well as good barrier properties. The water contact angle was as high as 130° and the minimum Cobb60 value was 5.7 g/m<sup>2</sup>, which was attributed to the hydrophobicity of AKD. In addition, the kit rating reached maximum 12/12 at coating weight of 8.26 g/m<sup>2</sup> and the water vapor transmittance rate (WVTR) was reduced to 153.4 g/(m<sup>2</sup>⋅day) at the coating weight of 10.50 g/m<sup>2</sup>. The tensile strength of the paper was increased from 28.1 to 43.6 MPa after coating. Overall, this coating can effectively improve the performance of paper-based materials, which may play an important role in the process of replacing disposable plastic packaging with paper-based materials.","akd, chitosan, coating, hydrophobic, oil resistant, pickering emulsion",International Journal Of Biological Macromolecules,develop degrad coat packag materi replac dispos plastic product effect way solv problem pollut microplast pollut novel coat develop alkyl keten dimer akd picker emuls chitosan work cellulos nanofibril cnf use stabil solid akd emuls addit chitosan agent coat provid excel hydrophob resist well good barrier properti water contact angl high minimum valu sup attribut hydrophob akd addit kit rate reach maximum coat weight sup water vapor transmitt rate wvtr reduc sup coat weight sup tensil strength paper increas mpa coat overal coat effect improv perform materi may play import role process replac dispos plastic packag materi fabric paper nanocellulos stabil picker emuls chitosan
140,Rationalizing the selection of oral lipid based drug delivery systems by an in vitro dynamic lipolysis model for improved oral bioavailability of poorly water soluble drugs.,"As a consequence of modern drug discovery techniques, there has been a consistent increase in the number of new pharmacologically active lipophilic compounds that are poorly water soluble. A great challenge facing the pharmaceutical scientist is making these molecules into orally administered medications with sufficient bioavailability. One of the most popular approaches to improve the oral bioavailability of these molecules is the utilization of a lipid based drug delivery system. Unfortunately, current development strategies in the area of lipid based delivery systems are mostly empirical. Hence, there is a need for a simplified in vitro method to guide the selection of a suitable lipidic vehicle composition and to rationalize the delivery system design. To address this need, a dynamic in vitro lipolysis model, which provides a very good simulation of the in vivo lipid digestion process, has been developed over the past few years. This model has been extensively used for in vitro assessment of different lipid based delivery systems, leading to enhanced understanding of the suitability of different lipids and surfactants as a delivery system for a given poorly water soluble drug candidate. A key goal in the development of the dynamic in vitro lipolysis model has been correlating the in vitro data of various drug-lipidic delivery system combinations to the resultant in vivo drug profile. In this paper, we discuss and review the need for this model, its underlying theory, practice and limitations, and the available data accumulated in the literature. Overall, the dynamic in vitro lipolysis model seems to provide highly useful initial guidelines in the development process of oral lipid based drug delivery systems for poorly water soluble drugs, and it predicts phenomena that occur in the pre-enterocyte stages of the intestinal absorption cascade.",no keywords,Journal Of Controlled Release : Official Journal Of The Controlled Release Society,consequ modern drug discoveri techniqu consist increas number new pharmacolog activ lipophil compound poorli water solubl great challeng face pharmaceut scientist make molecul oral administ medic suffici bioavail one popular approach improv oral bioavail molecul util lipid base drug deliveri system unfortun current develop strategi area lipid base deliveri system mostli empir henc need simplifi vitro method guid select suitabl lipid vehicl composit ration deliveri system design address need dynam vitro lipolysi model provid good simul vivo lipid digest process develop past year model extens use vitro assess differ lipid base deliveri system lead enhanc understand suitabl differ lipid surfact deliveri system given poorli water solubl drug candid key goal develop dynam vitro lipolysi model correl vitro data variou deliveri system combin result vivo drug profil paper discus review need model underli theori practic limit avail data accumul literatur overal dynam vitro lipolysi model seem provid highli use initi guidelin develop process oral lipid base drug deliveri system poorli water solubl drug predict phenomenon occur stage intestin absorpt cascad ration select oral lipid base drug deliveri system vitro dynam lipolysi model improv oral bioavail poorli water solubl drug

143,Wearable Osmotic-Capillary Patch for Prolonged Sweat Harvesting and Sensing.,"Biomarkers in sweat are a largely untapped source of health information. Most of the currently available sweat harvesting and testing devices are incapable of operating under low-sweat rates such as those experienced by humans at rest. Here we analyze the <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> sampling of sweat through osmosis <i>via</i> the use of a hydrogel interfaced with the skin, without need for active perspiration. The hydrogel also interfaces with paper-based microfluidics to transport the fluid <i>via</i> capillary forces toward a testing zone and then evaporation pad. We show that the hydrogel solute content and area of the evaporation pad regulate the long-term extraction of sweat and its associated biomarkers. The results indicate that the platform can sample biomarkers from a model skin system continuously for approximately 12 h. On-skin testing of the platform on both resting and exercising human subjects confirms that it can sample sweat lactate directly from the surface of skin. The results highlight that lactate in sweat increases with exercise and as a direct result of muscle activity. Implementation of such new principles for sweat fluid harvesting and management <i>via</i> wearable patch devices can contribute toward the advancement of next generation wearables.","hydrogels, lactate, osmotic pumping, paper microfluidics, sweat bioassay",Acs Applied Materials & Interfaces,biomark sweat larg untap sourc health inform current avail sweat harvest test devic incap oper rate experienc human rest analyz vitro vivo sampl sweat osmosi via use hydrogel interfac skin without need activ perspir hydrogel also interfac microfluid transport fluid via capillari forc toward test zone evapor pad show hydrogel solut content area evapor pad regul extract sweat associ biomark result indic platform sampl biomark model skin system continu approxim test platform rest exercis human subject confirm sampl sweat lactat directli surfac skin result highlight lactat sweat increas exercis direct result muscl activ implement new principl sweat fluid harvest manag via wearabl patch devic contribut toward advanc next gener wearabl wearabl patch prolong sweat harvest sen
144,Stimulating solidarity to improve knowledge on medications used during pregnancy : A contribution from the ConcePTION project.,"Pregnant people have been overlooked or excluded from clinical research, resulting in a lack of scientific knowledge on medication safety and efficacy during pregnancy. Thus far, both the opportunities to generate evidence-based knowledge beyond clinical trials and the role of pregnant people in changing their status quo have not been discussed. Some scholars have argued that for rare disease patients, for whom, just like pregnant people, a poor evidence base exists regarding treatments, solidarity has played an important role in addressing the evidence gap. This paper explores whether and how the enactment of solidarity among pregnant people can be stimulated to help address the poor evidence base on medications used during pregnancy.","empowerment, ethics, learning healthcare systems, pregnant people, real-world data, solidarity",Bmc Medical Ethics,pregnant peopl overlook exclud clinic research result lack scientif knowledg medic safeti efficaci pregnanc thu far opportun gener knowledg beyond clinic trial role pregnant peopl chang statu quo discus scholar argu rare diseas patient like pregnant peopl poor evid base exist regard treatment solidar play import role address evid gap paper explor whether enact solidar among pregnant peopl stimul help address poor evid base medic use pregnanc stimul solidar improv knowledg medic use pregnanc contribut concept project

The aim of this study was to evaluate children's acceptability of compounded preparations and to provide information regarding compounding practices' characteristics in a Romanian hospital setting. An observational, cross-sectional, and retrospective study was conducted in three Clinical Pediatric Departments (Emergency Clinical Hospital for Children, Cluj-Napoca). The study population comprised patients under 18 years old taking at least one compounded medication. Study data was collected mainly through an interviewer-administered questionnaire and medicine acceptability was assessed based on the children's first reaction to the preparations using a 3-point facial hedonic scale. A total of 162 compounded medications were evaluated. A positive/negative reaction was reported for 20.83%/58.33%, 20.63%/49.21%, and 66.67%/7.41% of oral, oromucosal and cutaneous dosage forms. Although patient disapproval was recorded for various reasons, medication administration was successful in over 75% of cases. Factors such as fewer steps required for intake of a dose, capsule dosage form, no additional food/drink immediately after drug intake, medication perceived as ""easy/very easy"" to swallow, were correlated with a better acceptability of oral preparations. This study highlights the importance of identifying factors that can improve the acceptability of compounded preparations and, subsequently, treatment outcomes in pediatric patients.","acceptability, compounded medications, hospital setting, oral, oromucosal and cutaneous dosage forms, pediatric patients",European Journal Of Pharmaceutics And Biopharmaceutics : Official Journal Of Arbeitsgemeinschaft Fur Pharmazeutische Verfahrenstechnik E.V,compound medicin wide use especi pediatr patient aim studi evalu child accept compound prepar provid inform regard compound practic characterist romanian hospit set observ retrospect studi conduct three clinic pediatr depart emerg clinic hospit child studi popul compris patient year old take least one compound medic studi data collect mainli questionnair medicin accept assess base child first reaction prepar use facial hedon scale total compound medic evalu reaction report oral oromucos cutan dosag form although patient disapprov record variou reason medic administr success case factor fewer step requir intak dose capsul dosag form addit immedi drug intak medic perceiv easi swallow correl better accept oral prepar studi highlight import identifi factor improv accept compound prepar subsequ treatment outcom pediatr patient accept compound prepar romanian pediatr hospit perspect
146,"Equipment and analytical companies meeting continuous challenges. May 20-21, 2014 Continuous Manufacturing Symposium.","This white paper focuses on equipment, and analytical manufacturers' perspectives, regarding the challenges of continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing across five prompt questions. In addition to valued input from several vendors, commentary was provided from experienced pharmaceutical representatives, who have installed various continuous platforms. Additionally, a small medium enterprise (SME) perspective was obtained through interviews. A range of technical challenges is outlined, including: the presence of particles, equipment scalability, fouling (and cleaning), technology derisking, specific analytical challenges, and the general requirement of improved technical training. Equipment and analytical companies can make a significant contribution to help the introduction of continuous technology. A key point is that many of these challenges exist in batch processing and are not specific to continuous processing. Backward compatibility of software is not a continuous issue per se. In many cases, there is available learning from other industries. Business models and opportunities through outsourced development partners are also highlighted. Agile smaller companies and academic groups have a key role to play in developing skills, working collaboratively in partnerships, and focusing on solving relevant industry challenges. The precompetitive space differs for vendor companies compared with large pharmaceuticals. Currently, there is no strong consensus around a dominant continuous design, partly because of business dynamics and commercial interests. A more structured common approach to process design and hardware and software standardization would be beneficial, with initial practical steps in modeling. Conclusions include a digestible systems approach, accessible and published business cases, and increased user, academic, and supplier collaboration. This mirrors US FDA direction. The concept of silos in pharmaceutical companies is a common theme throughout the white papers. In the equipment domain, this is equally prevalent among a broad range of companies, mainly focusing on discrete areas. As an example, the flow chemistry and secondary drug product communities are almost entirely disconnected. Control and Process Analytical Technologies (PAT) companies are active in both domains. The equipment actors are a very diverse group with a few major Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) players and a variety of SME, project providers, integrators, upstream downstream providers, and specialist PAT. In some cases, partnerships or alliances are formed to increase critical mass. This white paper has focused on small molecules; equipment associated with biopharmaceuticals is covered in a separate white paper. More specifics on equipment detail are provided in final dosage form and drug substance white papers. The equipment and analytical development from laboratory to pilot to production is important, with a variety of sensors and complexity reducing with scale. The importance of robust processing rather than overcomplex control strategy mitigation is important. A search of nonacademic literature highlights, with a few notable exceptions, a relative paucity of material. Much focuses on the economics and benefits of continuous, rather than specifics of equipment issues. The disruptive nature of continuous manufacturing represents either an opportunity or a threat for many companies, so the incentive to change equipment varies.

148,Pediatric oral extemporaneous preparations and practices: International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP) global study.,"This publication is the first to report current, global, pediatric oral extemporaneous compounding practices. Complete survey responses were received from 479 participants actively involved in compounding across all the World Health Organization (WHO) regions. The survey addressed oral formulation of extemporaneous liquids, including the use of commercial or in-house vehicles, flavoring excipients, source of formulation recipes, and beyond use dates (BUDs). Over 90% of the survey participants prepared oral liquids. Solid dosage forms, comprising capsules and powder papers (sachets), were also frequently prepared for children, albeit to a lesser extent. The top 20 active pharmaceutical ingredients compounded for children, globally, were: omeprazole, captopril, spironolactone, propranolol, furosemide, phenobarbital, hydrochlorothiazide, ursodeoxycholic acid, sildenafil, melatonin, clonidine, enalapril, dexamethasone, baclofen, caffeine, chloral hydrate, trimethoprim, atenolol, hydrocortisone, carvedilol and prednisolone. Diuretics, drugs for acid-related disorders, and beta-blockers were the top three most frequently compounded classes per the WHO Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system. The principal need identified for the practice of extemporaneous compounding for children was the development of an international, open-access formulary that includes validated formulations, as well as updated compounding literature and guidelines. Furthermore, improved access to data from stability studies to allow compounding of formulations with extended BUDs.","age-appropriate medicines, best pharmaceuticals for children act (bpca), beyond use date, formulation, infant, patient-centric, pediatric investigation plan (pip), pediatric research equity act (prea), solution, suspension, toddler, who essential medicines",European Journal Of Pharmaceutics And Biopharmaceutics : Official Journal Of Arbeitsgemeinschaft Fur Pharmazeutische Verfahrenstechnik E.V,public first report current global pediatr oral extemporan compound practic complet survey respons receiv particip activ involv compound across world health organ region survey address oral formul extemporan liquid includ use commerci vehicl flavor excipi sourc formul recip beyond use date bud survey particip prepar oral liquid solid dosag form compris capsul powder paper sachet also frequent prepar child albeit lesser extent top activ pharmaceut ingredi compound child global omeprazol captopril spironolacton propranolol furosemid phenobarbit hydrochlorothiazid ursodeoxychol acid sildenafil melatonin clonidin enalapril dexamethason baclofen caffein chloral hydrat trimethoprim atenolol hydrocortison carvedilol prednisolon diuret drug disord top three frequent compound class per anatom therapeut chemic atc classif system princip need identifi practic extemporan compound child develop intern formulari includ valid formul well updat compound literatur guidelin furthermor improv access data stabil studi allow compound formul extend bud pediatr oral extemporan prepar practic intern pharmaceut feder fip global studi
149,From distress to disease: a critique of the medicalisation of possession in DSM-5.,"This paper critiques the category of possession-form dissociative identity disorder as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 (DSM-5) published in 2013 by the American Psychiatric Association (APA). The DSM as an index of psychiatry pathologises possession by categorising it as a form of dissociative identity disorder. Drawing upon ethnographic fieldwork, this paper argues that such a pathologisation medicalises possession, which is understood as a non-pathological condition in other contexts such as by those individuals who manifest possession at a temple in Kerala, South India. Through medicalising and further by creating distinctions between acceptable and pathological possession, the DSM converts a form of distress into a disease. This has both conceptual and pragmatic implications. The temple therefore becomes reduced to a culturally acceptable site for the manifestation of a mental illness in a form that is culturally available and possession is explained solely through a biomedical framework, denying alternative conceptualisations and theories which inform possession. By focussing on the DSM-5 classification of possession and the limitations of such a classification, this paper seeks to posit an alternative conceptualisation of possession by engaging with three primary areas which are significant in the DSM categorisation of possession: the DSM's conceptualisation of self in the singular, the distinction between pathological and non-pathological forms of possession, and the limitations of the DSM's equation of the condition of possession with the manifestation of possession. Finally, the paper briefly highlights alternative conceptualisations of possession, which emerged from the perspective of those seeking to heal possession at the Chottanikkara temple.","kerala, spirit possession, disease, distress, healing, treatment",Anthropology & Medicine,paper critiqu categori dissoci ident disord defin diagnost statist manual mental disord publish american psychiatr associ apa dsm index psychiatri pathologis possess categoris form dissoci ident disord draw upon ethnograph fieldwork paper argu pathologis medicalis possess understood condit context individu manifest possess templ kerala south india medicalis creat distinct accept patholog possess dsm convert form distress diseas conceptu pragmat implic templ therefor becom reduc cultur accept site manifest mental ill form cultur avail possess explain sole biomed framework deni altern conceptualis theori inform possess focus classif possess limit classif paper seek posit altern conceptualis possess engag three primari area signific dsm categoris possess dsm conceptualis self singular distinct patholog form possess limit dsm equat condit possess manifest possess final paper briefli highlight altern conceptualis possess emerg perspect seek heal possess chottanikkara templ distress diseas critiqu medicalis possess
150,"Fingermarks development on gloves: Relative efficiency of 1,2 Indanedione/ZnCl<sub>2</sub>, ninhydrin and wet powder.","Powder suspensions such as wet powder are used to develop fingermarks on adhesive surfaces. They can also be used on gloves but these ready-to-use commercial pre-mixed solutions are not entirely satisfactory. Among other things, they generate some background noise that can sometimes be substantial and make the exploitation of the fingermarks difficult. Recent studies have proven the effectiveness of a HFE ninhydrin solution on some types of gloves. Ninhydrin and 1,2-indanedione are reagents that are commonly used for the visualisation of fingermarks on porous and semi-porous substrates. Applying them on gloves might help to overcome the issue of background noise being produced by powder suspensions. In this study, several formulations of ninhydrin and 1,2-indanedione are compared to wet powder on a sample of nitrile, latex and vinyl gloves. The subsequent results show a greater effectiveness with the use of wet powder.","glove, indanedione, ninhydrin, papillary mark, wet powder",Science & Justice : Journal Of The Forensic Science Society,powder suspens wet powder use develop fingermark adhes surfac also use glove commerci solut entir satisfactori among thing gener background nois sometim substanti make exploit fingermark difficult recent studi proven effect hfe ninhydrin solut type glove ninhydrin reagent commonli use visualis fingermark porou substrat appli glove might help overcom issu background nois produc powder suspens studi sever formul ninhydrin compar wet powder sampl nitril latex vinyl glove subsequ result show greater effect use wet powder fingermark develop glove rel effici sub ninhydrin wet powder
151,Production of a NiO/Al primary battery employing powder-based electrodes.,"This paper describes the use of aluminum and zinc as anodic materials for a battery employing nickel (II) oxide (NiO) as cathode. Comparison of both materials resulted in the development of a compact, cost effective, and easy to use primary NiO/Al battery employing an alkaline electrolyte. The system features electrodes composed of powder forms of the active materials on modified paper substrates that are contained in a simple multilayer design utilizing thin laminated plastic materials to provide structure and flexibility to the battery as well as a paper separator. Various concentrations of potassium hydroxide (KOH) electrolyte were examined and maximum performance was observed at 6 M KOH. A maximum current density and power density of 1.94 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> and 1 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> , respectively was achieved. This user-friendly device was able to produce a maximum capacity of 2.33 mAh/g when 2 mA/g was applied.

Based on my doctoral and post-doctoral anthropological research on contraception and abortion in Salvador, Bahia, this paper initially traces the ""conversion"" of misoprostol from a drug to treat ulcers to a self-administered abortifacient in Latin America, and its later conversion to aneclectic global obstetric tool. It then shows how, while reducing maternal mortality, its use as an illegal abortifacient has reinforced the double reproductive citizenship regime existing in countries with restrictive abortion laws and poor post-abortion care services, where poor women using it illegally are stigmatised, discriminated against and exposed to potentially severe health risks.",no keywords,"Historia, Ciencias, Saude--Manguinhos",paper examin doubl life misoprostol brazil illeg use woman abortifaci legal use obstetr hospit ward base doctor anthropolog research contracept abort salvador bahia paper initi trace convers misoprostol drug treat ulcer abortifaci latin america later convers aneclect global obstetr tool show reduc matern mortal use illeg abortifaci reinforc doubl reproduct citizenship regim exist countri restrict abort law poor care servic poor woman use illeg stigmatis discrimin expo potenti sever health risk biomedicalis illeg abort doubl life misoprostol brazil
154,Bacteria survival probability in bactericidal filter paper.,"Bactericidal filter papers offer the simplicity of gravity filtration to simultaneously eradicate microbial contaminants and particulates. We previously detailed the development of biocidal block copolymer micelles that could be immobilized on a filter paper to actively eradicate bacteria. Despite the many advantages offered by this system, its widespread use is hindered by its unknown mechanism of action which can result in non-reproducible outcomes. In this work, we sought to investigate the mechanism by which a certain percentage of Escherichia coli cells survived when passing through the bactericidal filter paper. Through the process of elimination, the possibility that the bacterial survival probability was controlled by the initial bacterial load or the existence of resistant sub-populations of E. coli was dismissed. It was observed that increasing the thickness or the number of layers of the filter significantly decreased bacterial survival probability for the biocidal filter paper but did not affect the efficiency of the blank filter paper (no biocide). The survival probability of bacteria passing through the antibacterial filter paper appeared to depend strongly on the number of collision between each bacterium and the biocide-loaded micelles. It was thus hypothesized that during each collision a certain number of biocide molecules were directly transferred from the hydrophobic core of the micelle to the bacterial lipid bilayer membrane. Therefore, each bacterium must encounter a certain number of collisions to take up enough biocide to kill the cell and cells that do not undergo the threshold number of collisions are expected to survive.","antibacterial micelles, bacterial survival, bactericidal filter, bioactive paper, biocides, cellulose","Colloids And Surfaces.

155,On good and bad forms of medicalization.,"The ongoing 'enhancement' debate pits critics of new self-shaping technologies against enthusiasts. One important thread of that debate concerns medicalization, the process whereby 'non-medical' problems become framed as 'medical' problems. In this paper I consider the charge of medicalization, which critics often level at new forms of technological self-shaping, and explain how that charge can illuminate--and obfuscate. Then, more briefly, I examine the charge of pharmacological Calvinism, which enthusiasts, in their support of technological self-shaping, often level at critics. And I suggest how that charge, too, can illuminate and obfuscate. Exploring the broad charge of medicalization and the narrower counter charge of pharmacological Calvinism leads me to conclude that, as satisfying as it can be to level one of those charges at our intellectual opponents, and as tempting as it is to lie down and rest with our favorite insight, we need to gather the energy to have a conversation about the difference between good and bad forms of medicalization. Specifically, I suggest that if we consider the 'medicalization of love,' we can see why critics of and enthusiasts about technological self-shaping should want (and in some cases have already begun) to distinguish between good and bad forms of such medicalization.",no keywords,Bioethics,ongo debat pit critic new technolog enthusiast one import thread debat concern medic process wherebi problem becom frame problem paper consid charg medic critic often level new form technolog explain charg illumin obfusc briefli examin charg pharmacolog calvin enthusiast support technolog often level critic suggest charg illumin obfusc explor broad charg medic narrow counter charg pharmacolog calvin lead conclud satisfi level one charg intellectu oppon tempt lie rest favorit insight need gather energi convers differ good bad form medic specif suggest consid love see critic enthusiast technolog want case alreadi begun distinguish good bad form medic good bad form medic
156,Highly water-resistant paper via infiltration with polymeric microspheres from nanocellulose-stabilized plant oil-derived monomer.,"Sustainable strategies to improve the water resistance of cellulose paper are actively sought. In this work, polymeric microspheres (PMs), prepared through emulsion polymerization of cellulose nanofibers stabilized rubber seed oil-derived monomer, were investigated as coatings on corrugated medium paper (CMP). After infiltrating porous paper with PMs, the water-resistant corrugated papers (WRCP<sub>n</sub>) with enhanced mechanical properties were obtained. When 30 wt% PMs were introduced, WRCP<sub>30</sub> turned out to be highly compacted with an increased water contact angle of 106.3° and a low water vapor transmission rate of 81 g/(m<sup>2</sup> d) at 23 °C. Meanwhile, the tensile strength of WRCP<sub>30</sub> increased to 22.2 MPa, a 4-fold increase from CMP. When tested in a well-hydrated state, 71% of its mechanical strength in the dry state was maintained. Even with a low content of 10 wt% PMs, WRCP<sub>10</sub> also exhibited stable tensile strength and water wettability during the cyclic soaking-drying process. Thus, the plant oil based sustainable emulsion polymers provide a convenient route for enhancing the overall performance of cellulose paper.","cellulose nanofiber, pickering emulsion polymerization, plant oil, polymeric microspheres, water resistance",International Journal Of Biological Macromolecules,sustain strategi improv water resist cellulos paper activ sought work polymer microspher pm prepar emuls polymer cellulos nanofib stabil rubber seed monom investig coat corrug medium paper cmp infiltr porou paper pm corrug paper wrcp sub n enhanc mechan properti obtain wt pm introduc wrcp sub turn highli compact increas water contact angl low water vapor transmiss rate sup meanwhil tensil strength wrcp sub increas mpa increas cmp test state mechan strength dri state maintain even low content wt pm wrcp sub also exhibit stabl tensil strength water wettabl cyclic process thu plant oil base sustain emuls polym provid conveni rout enhanc overal perform cellulos paper highli paper via infiltr polymer microspher plant monom
157,Simplified fabrication of laminated paper-based analytical device (LPAD) with color-palette mobile app for analysis of salicylic acid in pharmaceutical products.,"In this work, we present for the first time, a simplified fabrication of a laminated paper-based analytical device (LPAD) with a free-mobile app, Palette Cam, for image analysis. A filter paper is cut in a rectangular shape (9 × 3 cm) and placed between a top laminating sheet with punched holes and a bottom laminating sheet. The holes allow accessibility of liquid on the paper. Thermal lamination is then employed to complete the fabrication of LPAD. Our simplified design reduces a tedious alignment of small pieces of paper to the holes. We demonstrated the LPAD with an analysis of salicylic acid in pharmaceutical products. Each 4 μL of ferric reagent and sample was dispensed on the LPAD. Smartphone was used to capture images. The RGB (red green blue) color intensity from the Palette Cam was converted into a logarithm color ratio. Our LPAD is simplified, cost-effective and able to be a portable device.","lpad, laminated paper-based analytical device, mobile app, palette cam, salicylic acid",Analytical Sciences : The International Journal Of The Japan Society For Analytical Chemistry,work present first time simplifi fabric lamin analyt devic lpad app palett cam imag analysi filter paper cut rectangular shape cm place top lamin sheet punch hole bottom lamin sheet hole allow access liquid paper thermal lamin employ complet fabric lpad simplifi design reduc tediou align small piec paper hole demonstr lpad analysi salicyl acid pharmaceut product μl ferric reagent sampl dispens lpad smartphon use captur imag rgb red green blue color intens palett cam convert logarithm color ratio lpad simplifi abl portabl devic simplifi fabric lamin analyt devic lpad mobil app analysi salicyl acid pharmaceut product

The WHO advocates a 50% reduction of harmful medication errors by 2022, but there is a lack of data in the UK that accurately estimates the true rate of intravenous medication errors. This study aimed to estimate the number of intravenous medication errors per 1000 administrations in the UK National Health Service and their associated economic costs.

159,Controlling Macroscopic Phase Separation of Aqueous Two-Phase Polymer Systems in Porous Media.,"In previous work, our group discovered a phenomenon in which a mixed polymer-salt or mixed micellar aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) separates into its two constituent phases as it flows within paper. While these ATPSs worked well in their respective studies to concentrate the target biomarker and improve the sensitivity of the lateral-flow immunoassay, different ATPSs can be advantageous for new applications based on factors such as biomarker partitioning or biochemical compatibility between ATPS and sample components. However, since the mechanism of phase separation in porous media is not completely understood, introducing other ATPSs to paper is an unpredictable process that relies on trial and error experiments. This is especially true for polymer-polymer ATPSs in which the characteristics of the two phases appear quite similar. Therefore, our group aimed to develop semiquantitative guidelines for choosing ATPSs that can phase separate in paper. In this work, we evaluated the Washburn equation and its parameters as a potential mathematical framework to describe the flow behavior of polymer-salt and micellar ATPSs in fiberglass paper. We compared bulk phase fluid characteristics and identified the viscosity difference between the phases as a key determinant of the potential for phase separation in paper. We then used this parameter to predict the phase separation capabilities of polyethylene glycol (PEG)-dextran ATPSs in paper and control the composition of the leading and lagging phases. We also, for the first time, successfully demonstrated the phase separation phenomenon in hydrogels, thereby extending its application and potential benefits to an alternative porous medium.","washburn equation, aqueous two-phase system, hydrogels, paper fluidics, point-of-care diagnostics",Slas Technology,previou work group discov phenomenon mix mix micellar aqueou system atp separ two constitu phase flow within paper atpss work well respect studi concentr target biomark improv sensit immunoassay differ atpss advantag new applic base factor biomark partit biochem compat atp sampl compon howev sinc mechan phase separ porou medium complet understood introduc atpss paper unpredict process reli trial error experi especi true atpss characterist two phase appear quit similar therefor group aim develop semiquantit guidelin choos atpss phase separ paper work evalu washburn equat paramet potenti mathemat framework describ flow behavior micellar atpss fiberglass paper compar bulk phase fluid characterist identifi viscos differ phase key determin potenti phase separ paper use paramet predict phase separ capabl polyethylen glycol peg atpss paper control composit lead lag phase also first time success demonstr phase separ phenomenon hydrogel therebi extend applic potenti benefit altern porou medium control macroscop phase separ aqueou polym system porou medium
160,Female genital mutilation/cutting: Emerging factors sustaining medicalization related changes in selected Kenyan communities.,"Although female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) has declined, it is pervasive albeit changing form among communities in Kenya. Transformation of FGM/C include medicalization although poorly understood has increased undermining abandonment efforts for the practice. We sought to understand drivers of medicalization in FGM/C among selected Kenyan communities. A qualitative study involving participants from Abagusii, Somali and Kuria communities and key informants with health care providers from four Kenyan counties was conducted. Data were collected using in-depth interviews (n = 54), key informant interviews (n = 56) and 45 focus group discussions. Data were transcribed and analyzed thematically using NVivo version 12. We found families practiced FGM/C for reasons including conformity to culture/tradition, religion, marriageability, fear of negative sanctions, and rite of passage. Medicalized FGM/C was only reported by participants from the Abagusii and Somali communities. Few Kuria participants shared that medicalized FGM/C was against their culture and would attract sanctions. Medicalized FGM/C was perceived to have few health complications, shorter healing, and enables families to hide from law. To avoid arrest or sanctions, medicalized FGM/C was performed at home/private clinics. Desire to mitigate health complications and income were cited as reasons for health providers performing of FGM/C. Medicalization was believed to perpetuate the practice as it was perceived as modernized FGM/C. FGM/C remains pervasive in the studied Kenyan communities albeit changed form and context. Findings suggest medicalization sustain FGM/C by allowing families and health providers to conform to social norms underpinning FGM/C while addressing risks of FGM/C complications and legal prohibitions. This underscores the need for more nuanced approaches targeting health providers, families and communities to promote abandonment of FGM/C while addressing medicalization.",no keywords,Plos One,although femal genit declin pervas albeit chang form among commun kenya transform includ medic although poorli understood increas undermin abandon effort practic sought understand driver medic among select kenyan commun qualit studi involv particip abagusii somali kuria commun key inform health care provid four kenyan counti conduct data collect use interview n key inform interview n focu group discus data transcrib analyz themat use nvivo version found famili practic reason includ conform religion marriag fear neg sanction rite passag medic report particip abagusii somali commun kuria particip share medic cultur would attract sanction medic perceiv health complic shorter heal enabl famili hide law avoid arrest sanction medic perform clinic desir mitig health complic incom cite reason health provid perform medic believ perpetu practic perceiv modern remain pervas studi kenyan commun albeit chang form context find suggest medic sustain allow famili health provid conform social norm underpin address risk complic legal prohibit underscor need nuanc approach target health provid famili commun promot abandon address medic femal genit emerg factor sustain medic relat chang select kenyan commun
161,Is the full potential of the biopharmaceutics classification system reached?,"In this paper we analyse how the biopharmaceutics classification system (BCS) has been used to date. A survey of the literature resulted in a compilation of 242 compounds for which BCS classes were reported. Of these, 183 compounds had been reported to belong to one specific BCS class whereas 59 compounds had been assigned to multiple BCS classes in different papers. Interestingly, a majority of the BCS class 2 compounds had fraction absorbed (FA) values >85%, indicating that they were completely absorbed after oral administration. Solubility was computationally predicted at pH 6.8 for BCS class 2 compounds to explore the impact of the pH of the small intestine, where most of the absorption occurs, on the solubility. In addition, the solubilization capacity of lipid aggregates naturally present in the intestine was studied computationally and experimentally for a subset of 12 compounds. It was found that all acidic compounds with FA>85% were completely dissolved in the pH of the small intestine. Further, lipids at the concentration used in fasted state simulated intestinal fluid (FaSSIF) dissolved the complete dose given of the most lipophilic (logD6.5>3) compounds studied. Overall, biorelevant dissolution media (pure buffer of intestinal pH or FaSSIF) identified that for 20 of the 29 BCS class 2 compounds with FA>85% the complete dose given orally would be dissolved. These results indicate that a more relevant pH restriction for acids and/or dissolution medium with lipids present better forecast solubility-limited absorption in vivo than the presently used BCS solubility criterion. The analysis presented herein further strengthens the discussion on the requirement of more physiologically relevant dissolution media for the in vitro solubility classification performed to reach the full potential of the BCS.","biopharmaceutics classification system, biorelevant dissolution, dose number, in silico, poorly soluble, solubility",European Journal Of Pharmaceutical Sciences : Official Journal Of The European Federation For Pharmaceutical Sciences,paper analys biopharmaceut classif system bc use date survey literatur result compil compound bc class report compound report belong one specif bc class wherea compound assign multipl bc class differ paper interestingli major bc class compound fraction absorb fa valu indic complet absorb oral administr solubl comput predict ph bc class compound explor impact ph small intestin absorpt occur solubl addit solubil capac lipid aggreg natur present intestin studi comput experiment subset compound found acid compound fa complet dissolv ph small intestin lipid concentr use fast state simul intestin fluid fassif dissolv complet dose given lipophil compound studi overal biorelev dissolut medium pure buffer intestin ph fassif identifi bc class compound fa complet dose given oral would dissolv result indic relev ph restrict acid dissolut medium lipid present better forecast absorpt vivo present use bc solubl criterion analysi present herein strengthen discus requir physiolog relev dissolut medium vitro solubl classif perform reach full potenti bc full potenti biopharmaceut classif system reach

163,Disordered eating and the contradictions of neoliberal governance.,"The last decade has seen the development of an important literature on the contradictions between neoliberal norms of corporal citizenship and the forms of consumption that market-based food systems promote. This paper seeks to contribute to the literature by exploring the relationship between these contradictions and the increased prevalence of particular eating disorders (binge eating disorder (BED) and bulimia nervosa). Within contemporary neoliberal food systems bingeing is increasingly normalised and consumption temporally disorganised. At the same time, neoliberal public health policy, and the wider 'health' entertainment media it legitimates, focuses on the promotion of 'correct' forms of consumer agency. Individuals who fail to manage consumption 'appropriately' are stigmatised. The growth of bulimia and BED can be related to the contradictory pressures that the food system and regime of corporal governance place on individuals. The paper also seeks to explore how the increased medicalisation and biomedicalisation of eating since the 1980s fits within a broader neoliberal governance strategy. By medicalising key social problems the neoliberal state depoliticises these issues. Medicalisation and biomedicalisation obscure the role of capitalism in generating these problems and encourage a focus on individual dysfunction.","capitalism, consumption, diet, eating disorders, government/state, political economy",Sociology Of Health & Illness,last decad seen develop import literatur contradict neoliber norm corpor citizenship form consumpt food system promot paper seek contribut literatur explor relationship contradict increas preval particular eat disord bing eat disord bed bulimia nervosa within contemporari neoliber food system bing increasingli normalis consumpt tempor disorganis time neoliber public health polici wider entertain medium legitim focus promot form consum agenc individu fail manag consumpt stigmatis growth bulimia bed relat contradictori pressur food system regim corpor govern place individu paper also seek explor increas medicalis biomedicalis eat sinc fit within broader neoliber govern strategi medicalis key social problem neoliber state depoliticis issu medicalis biomedicalis obscur role capit gener problem encourag focu individu dysfunct disord eat contradict neoliber govern
164,Paper-Based Working Electrodes Coated with Mercury or Bismuth Films for Heavy Metals Determination.,"Paper-based carbon working electrodes were modified with mercury or bismuth films for the determination of trace metals in aqueous solutions. Both modification procedures were optimized in terms of selectivity and sensitivity for the determination of different heavy metals, aiming their simultaneous determination. Cd (II), Pb (II) and In (III) could be quantified with both films. However, Cu (II) could not be determined with bismuth films. The modification with mercury films led to the most sensitive method, with linear ranges between 0.1 and 10 µg/mL and limits of detection of 0.4, 0.1, 0.04 and 0.2 µg/mL for Cd (II), Pb (II), In (III) and Cu (II), respectively.

165,Super-swelling lignin-based biopolymer hydrogels for soil water retention from paper industry waste.,"Sources of pulping red liquor, which is produced by acidic sulfite cooking in paper industry, consisted of lignosulphonate and polysaccharide, commonly considered as waste or byproducts and used in low value, such as surfactant and adhesive are wide and its price is low. Here a novel method for high value-added utilization of the pulp and paper industry waste for fabricating super-swelling biopolymer hydrogels is introduced. In contrast to other costly utilizations, which are needed to separate red liquor or purify hemicellulose and lignin before using, it is first time to directly utilize red liquor to prepare hydrogels without pretreatment. FT-IR, SEM, TGA and XRD are used to determine structure and morphology of hydrogels. It is excited the hydrogels fabricated from acrylic (AA) and industry waste exhibit super-swelling and slow release behaviors in water.

166,Taking pills for developmental ails in Southern Brazil: The biologization of adolescence?,"In the late 1990s researchers in Pelotas Southern Brazil began documenting what they considered to be unacceptably high rates of licensed psychotropic use among individuals of all ages, including youth. This came as a surprise, since the vast majority of psychiatrists in Pelotas draw on psychoanalytic theory and approach pharmaceutical use, especially for children and adolescents, in a consciously tempered way. Drawing from a longitudinal ethnographic sub-study, part of a larger 1982 birth cohort study, this paper follows the circuitous trajectories of emergent pharma-patterns among ""shantytown"" youth over a ten-year period, exploring the thickly layered and often moralized contingencies in which psychodynamic psychiatrists' intention to resist excessive pharmaceuticalization both succeed and crumble. I juxtapose these trajectories with the growing salience of an ""anti-biologizing"" explanatory framework that psychiatrists and researchers are using to pre-empt the kind of diagnostics-driven ""biopsychiatrization"" so prevalent in North America. My analysis suggests that psychiatrists' use of this framework ironically contributes to their failed attempts to ""resist"" pharmaceuticalization.","brazil, child psychiatry, epistemology, medicalization, pharmaceuticals, prototype, psychoanalysis",Social Science & Medicine (1982),late research pelota southern brazil began document consid unaccept high rate licens psychotrop use among individu age includ youth came surpris sinc vast major psychiatrist pelota draw psychoanalyt theori approach pharmaceut use especi child adolesc conscious temper way draw longitudin ethnograph part larger birth cohort studi paper follow circuit trajectori emerg among shantytown youth period explor thickli layer often moral conting psychodynam psychiatrist intent resist excess pharmaceutic succeed crumbl juxtapos trajectori grow salienc explanatori framework psychiatrist research use kind biopsychiatr preval north america analysi suggest psychiatrist use framework iron contribut fail attempt resist pharmaceutic take pill development ail southern brazil biolog adolesc
167,Analysing the skin barrier from down under.,"Over the past 40 years the Australian contribution to the field of skin science has been led by Michael Roberts. One of his earliest papers on membrane permeation was published in Nature, setting the scene for his huge contribution to both the fundamental understanding of skin permeability and the application of that knowledge to improved clinical outcomes, new delivery technologies and minimizing toxicological risk. His work has been characterized by a mechanistic, mathematical approach to defining skin permeation. He defined the parameters important to skin permeation, established structure-penetration relationships and demonstrated the importance of maximum flux from a clinical and toxicological viewpoint. Through his systematic approach, Mike showed a parabolic relationship between maximum flux and lipophilicity, and established that this is driven mainly by variations in solubility of the solute in the stratum corneum. One of the significant strengths of Mike's work is the ability to express biological concepts in mathematical terms. He has developed mathematical models that enhance our understanding of epidermal, dermal, deep tissue permeation and follicular transport. Throughout his career Mike has been involved in pioneering new technologies both for analysing the skin barrier and influencing permeation across it. His fundamental work in the area of iontophoresis provided models that defined the parameters influencing its permeation enhancement. Mike's research has been translated into improved clinical outcomes, reduced toxicological risk and changes to the regulation of skin products.

In this work, a wax-printed paper-based analytical device combined with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) catalyzed luminol chemiluminescence (CL) system for the determination of ofloxacin (OFLX) was presented. It was based on the enhancement of CL intensity of luminol-H2O2-OFLX system by AgNPs. Wax-printing fabrication technique was used to make the simple circle shaped paper device and large scale chips can be fabricated at the same time. Under the selected experimental conditions, a linear relationship was obtained between the CL intensity and the concentration of OFLX in the range from 1.0×10(-9) g/mL to 1.0×10(-6) g/mL with a detection limit of 3.0×10(-10) g/mL. This method has been successfully applied to the determination of OFLX in eyedrop samples.","chemiluminescence, ofloxacin, paper-based analytical device, silver nanoparticle","Spectrochimica Acta.

170,Distance-based paper device coupled with uracil-rich DNA hydrogel for visual quantification of Uracil-DNA glycosylase.,"Uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG), an enzyme for repairing uracil-containing DNA damage, is crucial for maintaining genomic stability. Simple and fast quantification of UDG activity is essential for biological assay and clinical diagnosis, since its aberrant level is associated with DNA damage and various diseases. Herein, we developed a fully integrated ""sample in-signal out"" distance-based paper analytical device (dPAD) for visual quantification of UDG using a flow-controlled uracil-rich DNA hydrogel (URDH). The uracil base sites contained in the DNA hydrogel are mis-incorporated with dUTP by rolling circle amplification (RCA), which simplifies the preparation process of the functionalized hydrogel. In the presence of UDG, the uracil in URDH can be recognized and removed to induce the permeability change of URDH, resulting in the visible distance signal along the paper channel. Using dPAD, as low as 6.4 × 10<sup>-4</sup> U/mL of UDG (within 80 min) is visually identified without any instruments and complicated operations. This integrated dPAD is advantageous for its simplicity, cost effectiveness, and ease of use. We envision that it has the great potential for point-of-care testing (POCT) in DNA damage testing, personalized healthcare assessment, and biomedical applications.","dna hydrogel, distance-based paper device, uracil-dna glycosylase, visual quantification",Biosensors & Bioelectronics,glycosylas udg enzym repair dna damag crucial maintain genom stabil simpl fast quantif udg activ essenti biolog assay clinic diagnosi sinc aberr level associ dna damag variou diseas herein develop fulli integr sampl paper analyt devic dpad visual quantif udg use dna hydrogel urdh uracil base site contain dna hydrogel dutp roll circl amplif rca simplifi prepar process function hydrogel presenc udg uracil urdh recogn remov induc permeabl chang urdh result visibl distanc signal along paper channel use dpad low sup udg within min visual identifi without instrument complic oper integr dpad advantag simplic cost effect ea use envis great potenti test poct dna damag test person healthcar assess biomed applic paper devic coupl dna hydrogel visual quantif glycosylas
171,A separation-free paper-based hydrogel device for one-step reactive oxygen species determination by a smartphone.,"Paper-based analytical devices (PADs) are very convenient for determining biomarkers in point-of-care (POC) diagnosis while requiring sample pre-treatment or impurity separation. This study reports a novel hydrogel-coupled, paper-based analytical device (PAD) for separation-free H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> colorimetric detection in both aqueous solution and cell lysis with sample-to-answer analysis by directly loading into the sample test zone. By encapsulating an inorganic mimic enzyme and chromogenic substrate into the sodium alginate (SA) hydrogel, amplification of the color signal after catalyzing the substrate could be achieved. Taking advantage of the nanoscale porous structure of the hydrogel and the lateral flow channel of the PAD, large interference fragments or bio-macromolecules are prevented from diffusing into the chromogenic reaction, whereas the small target molecules enter the sensing region to trigger the catalytic reaction. This method demonstrated a rapid and accurate analysis with a limit of detection as low as 0.06 mM and detection selectivity. Our proposed device requires no enzyme and is separation-free, portable, easy-to-fabricate, and low-cost, and may offer a platform for quantitative or qualitative analysis of other analytes in body fluids for POC applications.",no keywords,Journal Of Materials Chemistry.

172,The application of tribology in assessing texture perception of oral liquid medicines.,"The palatability of medicines is likely to have a significant impact on patient adherence and consequently, on the safety and efficacy of a medicinal product. Palatability encompasses properties of medicines not limited to taste including swallowability (e.g. size, shape, texture). However, there has been limited work undertaken to measure the texture of medicines and how this may affect palatability and subsequent adherence. Tribology offers an understanding of oral processes and can allow physical properties of materials to be linked to ""mouthfeel"". This paper describes a preliminary application of tribology to oral liquid medicines and demonstrates that this technique is useful in the development of future oral liquid medicines.","medicine, mouthfeel, texture, tribology",International Journal Of Pharmaceutics,palat medicin like signific impact patient adher consequ safeti efficaci medicin product palat encompass properti medicin limit tast includ swallow size shape textur howev limit work undertaken measur textur medicin may affect palat subsequ adher tribolog offer understand oral process allow physic properti materi link mouthfeel paper describ preliminari applic tribolog oral liquid medicin demonstr techniqu use develop futur oral liquid medicin applic tribolog assess textur percept oral liquid medicin

175,The problem of over-medicalisation: How AOD disease models perpetuate inequity for young people with multiple disadvantage.,"Young people who experience multiple disadvantage have been identified as some of the most marginalised and under-serviced people in the alcohol and other drug (AOD) system. In this paper, we draw on a range of research evidence to argue that one of the challenges in responding appropriately to the needs of these young people are models of care which seek to ameliorate 'illness' rather than promote wellness. While disease approaches have some important benefits, overly-medicalised AOD treatment responses also have negative impacts. We argue that disease models rest on understandings of substance use as an individual enterprise and thereby pay insufficient attention to the material disadvantage that shape young people's substance use, creating feelings of shame, failure and a reluctance to return to care if they continue to use. Additionally we draw on literature that shows how disease models construe young people's substance use as compulsive, perpetuating deficit views of them as irrational and failing to account for the specific meanings that young people themselves give to their substance use. By focusing on clinical solutions rather than material and relational ones, medicalised treatment responses perpetuate inequity: they benefit young people whose resources and normative values align with the treatments offered by disease models, but are much less helpful to those who are under-resourced,. We suggest that alternative approaches can be found in First Nations models of care and youth programs that attend to social, cultural, and material wellbeing, making living well the focus of treatment rather than illness amelioration.","alcohol and drug treatment, medicalisation, multiple disadvantage, young people",The International Journal On Drug Policy,young peopl experi multipl disadvantag identifi marginalis peopl alcohol drug aod system paper draw rang research evid argu one challeng respond appropri need young peopl model care seek amelior rather promot well diseas approach import benefit aod treatment respons also neg impact argu diseas model rest understand substanc use individu enterpris therebi pay insuffici attent materi disadvantag shape young peopl substanc use creat feel shame failur reluct return care continu use addit draw literatur show diseas model constru young peopl substanc use compuls perpetu deficit view irrat fail account specif mean young peopl give substanc use focus clinic solut rather materi relat one medicalis treatment respons perpetu inequ benefit young peopl whose resourc norm valu align treatment offer diseas model much less help suggest altern approach found first nation model care youth program attend social cultur materi wellb make live well focu treatment rather ill amelior problem aod diseas model perpetu inequ young peopl multipl disadvantag

Paper microfluidics has also emerged as a low cost, easy to fabricate and portable approach for point of care testing. However, due to inherent background fluorescence, combining Raman spectroscopy with paper microfluidics is to date an unmet challenge in the absence of using surface enhanced mechanisms. We describe the first use of wavelength modulated Raman spectroscopy (WMRS) for analysis on a paper microfluidics platform. This study demonstrates the ability to suppress the background fluorescence of the paper using WMRS and the subsequent implementation of this technique for pharmaceutical analysis.

177,[Identification and Analysis of LSD Derivatives in Illegal Products as Paper Sheet].,"To prevent the abuse of new psychoactive substances (NPS), a total of 2372 substances and two plants are controlled as ""Designated Substances"" in Japan as of September 2019. Although the distribution of these substances has decreased for the past three years, newly-emerged NPS are still being found. In this study, we detected four lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) derivatives as designer drugs from four paper sheet products, which were obtained from 2014 to 2017 in Japan. The compounds were identified as 4-Acetyl-N,N-diethyl-7-methyl-4,6,6a,7,8,9-hexahydroindolo[4,3-fg]quinoline-9-carboxamide (ALD-52), N,N,7-triethyl-4,6,6a,7,8,9-hexahydroindolo[4,3-fg]quinoline-9-carboxamide (ETH-LAD), 7-Allyl-N,N-diethyl-4,6,6a,7,8,9-hexahydroindolo[4,3-fg]quinoline-9-carboxamide (AL-LAD), N,N-diethyl-7-methyl-4-propionyl-4,6,6a,7,8,9-hexahydroindolo[4,3-fg]quinoline-9-carboxamide (1P-LSD), by GC-MS, LC-MS, LC-Q-TOF-MS and NMR analyses.

178,Starch-based nanospheres modified filter paper for o/w emulsions separation and contaminants removal.,"There is a pressing need around the world to develop novel functional biodegradable materials to separate oil/water mixtures and emulsions completely. Recently, superhydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity materials have been attracted attention due to their high efficiency in oil/water separation. However, it is still a challenge to prepare materials that combine oil/water separation and water purification in an environment-friendly way. In this work, biodegradable starch-based nanospheres (SNPs) coated filter paper was prepared in a low-cost, simple, and environmentally friendly manner. The SNPs coating could not only help to change the wettability of the substrate material but also build the hierarchical micro and nano structures which are conducive to separation and purification process. After modification by coating SNPs, the filter paper exhibited excellent performance in a wide range of oil/water mixtures or emulsions separation and the wettability of the filter paper could be regulated by adjusting the pH value. The modified filter paper presented good recyclability after several separation process. Furthermore, the as-prepared filter paper could also remove water-soluble contaminants during the oil/water separation process, thus realizing to combine separation and purification process in one single step. This biodegradable starch-based separating material with good separation performance, stability and recyclability has significant application potential in practical separation and purification process.","filter paper, oil in water emulsion, separation and purification, starch-based nanospheres, water-soluble dyes",International Journal Of Biological Macromolecules,press need around world develop novel function biodegrad materi separ mixtur emuls complet recent superhydrophil underwat superoleophob materi attract attent due high effici separ howev still challeng prepar materi combin separ water purif way work biodegrad nanospher snp coat filter paper prepar simpl environment friendli manner snp coat could help chang wettabl substrat materi also build hierarch micro nano structur conduc separ purif process modif coat snp filter paper exhibit excel perform wide rang mixtur emuls separ wettabl filter paper could regul adjust ph valu modifi filter paper present good recycl sever separ process furthermor filter paper could also remov contamin separ process thu realiz combin separ purif process one singl step biodegrad separ materi good separ perform stabil recycl signific applic potenti practic separ purif process nanospher modifi filter paper emuls separ contamin remov

180,"Procreation machines: Ectogenesis as reproductive enhancement, proper medicine or a step towards posthumanism?","Full ectogenesis as the complete externalization of human reproduction by bypassing the bodily processes of gestation and childbirth can be considered the culmination of genetic and reproductive technologies. Despite its still being a hypothetical scenario, it has been discussed for decades as the ultimate means to liberate women from their reproductive tasks in society and hence finally end fundamental gender injustices generally. In the debate about the application of artificial wombs to achieve gender equality, one aspect is barely mentioned but is of crucial relevance from a medical-ethical perspective: whether and how could full ectogenesis be justified as a proper use of medicine? After characterizing the technology as a special form of human enhancement and as an extension of medical practice that goes beyond the traditional field of medicine, this paper critically assesses the theoretical possibilities of legitimizing this extension. We identify two ways of justification: either one argues that ectogenesis fulfils a proper goal of medicine (a justification we call pathologization), or one argues that the application of ectogenesis achieves a non-medical goal (which we call medicalization). Because it is important from a medical-ethical point of view to avoid an inappropriate instrumentalization or misuse of medicine and thus an undue medicalization of non-medical problems, a set of necessary conditions has to be met. It is doubtful whether full ectogenesis for non-medical purposes could fulfil these conditions. Rather, its comprehensive usage could be seen as a revolutionary modification of what it means to be human.","ectogenesis, gender equality, goals of medicine, human enhancement, medicalization, pathologization",Bioethics,full ectogenesi complet extern human reproduct bypass bodili process gestat childbirth consid culmin genet reproduct technolog despit still hypothet scenario discus decad ultim mean liber woman reproduct task societi henc final end fundament gender injustic gener debat applic artifici womb achiev gender equal one aspect bare mention crucial relev perspect whether could full ectogenesi justifi proper use medicin character technolog special form human enhanc extens medic practic goe beyond tradit field medicin paper critic assess theoret possibl legitim extens identifi two way justif either one argu ectogenesi fulfil proper goal medicin justif call patholog one argu applic ectogenesi achiev goal call medic import point view avoid inappropri instrument misus medicin thu undu medic problem set necessari condit met doubt whether full ectogenesi purpos could fulfil condit rather comprehens usag could seen revolutionari modif mean human procreat machin ectogenesi reproduct enhanc proper medicin step toward posthuman
181,A Holistic Approach to Determining Stereochemistry of Potential Pharmaceuticals by Circular Dichroism with β-Lactams as Test Cases.,"This paper's main objective is to show that many different factors must be considered when solving stereochemical problems to avoid misleading conclusions and obtain conclusive results from the analysis of spectroscopic properties. Particularly in determining the absolute configuration, the use of chiroptical methods is crucial, especially when other techniques, including X-ray crystallography, fail, are not applicable, or give inconclusive results. Based on various β-lactam derivatives as models, we show how to reliably determine their absolute configuration (AC) and preferred conformation from circular dichroism (CD) spectra. Comprehensive CD analysis, employing both approaches, i.e., traditional with their sector and helicity rules, and state-of-the-art supported by quantum chemistry (QC) calculations along with solvation models for both electronic (ECD) and vibrational (VCD) circular dichroism ranges, allows confident defining stereochemistry of the β-lactams studied. Based on an in-depth analysis of the results, we have shown that choosing a proper chiroptical method/s strictly depends on the specific case and certain structural features.","absolute configuration, circular dichroism, conformation, stereochemistry, β-lactam",International Journal Of Molecular Sciences,paper main object show mani differ factor must consid solv stereochem problem avoid mislead conclus obtain conclus result analysi spectroscop properti particularli determin absolut configur use chiropt method crucial especi techniqu includ crystallographi fail applic give inconclus result base variou deriv model show reliabl determin absolut configur ac prefer conform circular dichroism cd spectrum comprehens cd analysi employ approach tradit sector helic rule support quantum chemistri qc calcul along solvat model electron ecd vibrat vcd circular dichroism rang allow confid defin stereochemistri studi base analysi result shown choos proper chiropt strictli depend specif case certain structur featur holist approach determin stereochemistri potenti pharmaceut circular dichroism test case
182,Paper-supported 3D cell culture for tissue-based bioassays.,"Fundamental investigations of human biology, and the development of therapeutics, commonly rely on 2D cell-culture systems that do not accurately recapitulate the structure, function, or physiology of living tissues. Systems for 3D cultures exist but do not replicate the spatial distributions of oxygen, metabolites, and signaling molecules found in tissues. Microfabrication can create architecturally complex scaffolds for 3D cell cultures that circumvent some of these limitations; unfortunately, these approaches require instrumentation not commonly available in biology laboratories. Here we report that stacking and destacking layers of paper impregnated with suspensions of cells in extracellular matrix hydrogel makes it possible to control oxygen and nutrient gradients in 3D and to analyze molecular and genetic responses. Stacking assembles the ""tissue"", whereas destacking disassembles it, and allows its analysis. Breast cancer cells cultured within stacks of layered paper recapitulate behaviors observed both in 3D tumor spheroids in vitro and in tumors in vivo: Proliferating cells in the stacks localize in an outer layer a few hundreds of microns thick, and growth-arrested, apoptotic, and necrotic cells concentrate in the hypoxic core where hypoxia-sensitive genes are overexpressed.

184,Visualization and measurement of flow in two-dimensional paper networks.,"The two-dimensional paper network (2DPN) is a versatile new microfluidic format for performing complex chemical processes. For chemical detection, for example, 2DPNs have the potential to exceed the capabilities and performance of existing paper-based lateral flow devices at a comparable cost and ease of use. To design such 2DPNs, it is necessary to predict 2D flow patterns and velocities within them, but because of the scattering of the paper matrix, conventional particle imaging velocimetry is not practical. In this note, we demonstrate two methods for visualization of flow in 2DPNs that are inexpensive, easy to implement, and quantifiable.",no keywords,Lab On A Chip,paper network versatil new microfluid format perform complex chemic process chemic detect exampl potenti exceed capabl perform exist later flow devic compar cost ea use design necessari predict flow pattern veloc within scatter paper matrix convent particl imag velocimetri practic note demonstr two method visual flow inexpens easi implement quantifi visual measur flow paper network
185,[Palliative care: between humanization and medicalization at the end of life].,"This paper analyzes the palliative care of terminal patients, examining the tensions between the humanization of care and the progressive medicalization at the end-of-life situation. The research upon which the article is based adopts a qualitative methodological approach derived from interviews with professionals and patients and ethnographic observations in a palliative care unit in the City of Buenos Aires, Argentina. The article describes the configuration of personalized and comprehensive health care based on the core values of more humanized end-of-life care promoted by palliative care supporters. Similarly, the paper analyzes how these practices are assisted by progress in the medicalization process in which the dimension of care is considered less an unprofessional area of medical practice than an area of care in which specific technical skills and know-how are employed. The articles explores how instead of being divergent, the logic of care and medicalization work in a complementary fashion.",no keywords,Ciencia & Saude Coletiva,paper analyz palli care termin patient examin tension human care progress medic situat research upon articl base adopt qualit methodolog approach deriv interview profession patient ethnograph observ palli care unit citi bueno air argentina articl describ configur person comprehens health care base core valu human care promot palli care support similarli paper analyz practic assist progress medic process dimens care consid less unprofession area medic practic area care specif technic skill employ articl explor instead diverg logic care medic work complementari fashion palli care human medic end life
186,Active Barrier Coating for Packaging Paper with Controlled Release of Sunflower Oils.,"The use of paper as a sustainable packaging material is favored, but it lacks sufficient barrier properties in terms of water repellence and oil resistance. Novel approaches consider active packaging materials or coatings with controlled release providing additional functionality for delivery of specific components to the surface. In this study, the development of a waterborne coating with organic nanoparticles and encapsulated sunflower oils is presented as a system for thermal release of the oil and on-demand tuning of the final barrier properties of the paper substrate. After synthesis of the nanoparticles, it seems that the encapsulation of various grades of sunflower oil (i.e., either poly-unsaturated or mono-unsaturated) strongly affects the encapsulation efficiency and thermal release profiles. The water contact angles are controlled by the oil release and chemical surface composition of the coating upon thermal heating. The oil resistance of the paper improves as a more continuous oil film is formed during thermal release. In particular, the chemical surface composition of the paper coatings is detailed by means of micro-Raman spectroscopy and surface imaging, which provide an analytical quantification tool to evaluate surface coverage, oil delivery, and variations in organic coating moieties.","barrier, coating, encapsulation, hydrophobicity, oleophobicity, packaging, paper, release, vegetable oil","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",use paper sustain packag materi favor lack suffici barrier properti term water repel oil resist novel approach consid activ packag materi coat control releas provid addit function deliveri specif compon surfac studi develop waterborn coat organ nanoparticl encapsul sunflow oil present system thermal releas oil tune final barrier properti paper substrat synthesi nanoparticl seem encapsul variou grade sunflow oil either strongli affect encapsul effici thermal releas profil water contact angl control oil releas chemic surfac composit coat upon thermal heat oil resist paper improv continu oil film form thermal releas particular chemic surfac composit paper coat detail mean spectroscopi surfac imag provid analyt quantif tool evalu surfac coverag oil deliveri variat organ coat moieti activ barrier coat packag paper control releas sunflow oil
187,Vitrification of bovine matured oocytes and blastocysts in a paper container.,"In the present study, we aimed to determine the applicability of a paper container for the vitrification of in vitro matured (IVM) bovine oocytes. In experiment 1, IVM oocytes were exposed to vitrification solution (20% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), 20% ethylene glycol (EG), and 5 mol/L sucrose), using a two-step method, for 30 s; loaded onto either a paper container or Cryotop; and stored in liquid nitrogen. No significant difference (P < 0.05) in the survival and blastocyst formation rates after in vitro vitrification was observed between the paper container and Cryotop. In experiment 2, IVM oocytes were exposed to either a two- or three-step vitrification solution. The three-step vitrification solution was not significantly different from the two-step solution in terms of oocyte survival, cleavage and blastocyst rates. In experiment 3, in vitro produced blastocysts were graded according to the manual of the International Embryo Transfer Society (grades 1 and 2) and vitrified using the two- and three-step methods. For grade 2 blastocysts, the three-step method showed significantly higher (P < 0.05) survival and hatched blastocyst rates than the two-step method, whereas for grade 1 blastocysts, no significant difference was observed. In conclusion, the paper device and three-step technique are suitable for oocytes and embryo vitrification.","blastocysts, oocytes, paper device, vitrification",Animal Science Journal = Nihon Chikusan Gakkaiho,present studi aim determin applic paper contain vitrif vitro matur ivm bovin oocyt experi ivm oocyt expo vitrif solut dimethylsulfoxid dmso ethylen glycol eg sucros use method load onto either paper contain cryotop store liquid nitrogen signific differ p surviv blastocyst format rate vitro vitrif observ paper contain cryotop experi ivm oocyt expo either vitrif solut vitrif solut significantli differ solut term oocyt surviv cleavag blastocyst rate experi vitro produc blastocyst grade accord manual intern embryo transfer societi grade vitrifi use method grade blastocyst method show significantli higher p surviv hatch blastocyst rate method wherea grade blastocyst signific differ observ conclus paper devic techniqu suitabl oocyt embryo vitrif vitrif bovin matur oocyt blastocyst paper contain
188,Rapid analysis of Aurantii Fructus Immaturus (Zhishi) using paper spray ionization mass spectrometry.,"Paper spray-mass spectrometry (PS-MS) is a rapid, solvent-efficient, and high-throughput analytical method for analyzing complex samples. In this study, a PS-MS method was developed to obtain MS profiles of Aurantii Fructus Immaturus (aka Zhishi in Chinese) in positive and negative ion modes. In combination with multivariate analyses, including principal component analysis and cluster analysis, the PS-MS profiles of 25 batches of Zhishi were discriminated in 25 batches of Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium Viride (aka Qingpi in Chinese; an adulterant of Zhishi). Moreover, a rapid quantitative analysis of synephrine, a prescriptive quality control component of Zhishi listed in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia, was conducted with PS-MS using synephrine-d2 as an internal standard (IS). The linearity range was 1.68-16.8μg/mL (R<sup>2</sup>=0.9985), the limit of quantitation was 0.5μg/mL. Relative standard deviations in the intra- and inter-day precision of the MS were 4.87 and 4.90%, respectively. Compared with HPLC results, there was no significant difference in the quantitation of synephrine. This study demonstrated that the PS-MS method is useful for the rapid discrimination and quality control of Zhishi samples.","aurantii fructus immaturus, paper spray-ms, quantitative analysis, synephrine",Journal Of Pharmaceutical And Biomedical Analysis,paper spectrometri rapid analyt method analyz complex sampl studi method develop obtain m profil aurantii fructu immaturu aka zhishi chine posit neg ion mode combin multivari analys includ princip compon analysi cluster analysi profil batch zhishi discrimin batch citri reticulata pericarpium virid aka qingpi chine adulter zhishi moreov rapid quantit analysi synephrin prescript qualiti control compon zhishi list chine pharmacopoeia conduct use intern standard linear rang r sup limit quantit rel standard deviat precis m respect compar hplc result signific differ quantit synephrin studi demonstr method use rapid discrimin qualiti control zhishi sampl rapid analysi aurantii fructu immaturu zhishi use paper spray ioniz mass spectrometri
189,Increasing the Reuse of Protein Non-Naïve Nonhuman Primates in Pharmaceutical Drug Discovery and Development: An Overview and Industry Position on the Challenges and Benefits.,"The IQ Consortium NHP Reuse Working Group (WG) comprises members from 15 pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. In 2020, the WG developed and distributed a detailed questionnaire on protein non-naïve NHP reuse to the WG member companies. The WG received responses from key stakeholders including principal investigators, facility managers, animal welfare officers and research scientists. This paper's content reflects the consolidated opinion of the WG members and the questionnaire responses on the subject of NHP reuse within nonclinical programs at all stages of research and development. Many of the pharmaceutical companies represented in the working group or participating in the questionnaire have already achieved some level of NHP reuse in their nonclinical programs, but the survey results suggested that there is significant potential to increase NHP reuse further and a need to understand the considerations involved in reuse more clearly. The WG has also focused carefully on the inherent concerns and risks of implementing protein non-naive NHP reuse and has evaluated the best methods of risk assessment and decision-making. This paper presents a discussion on the challenges and opportunities surrounding protein non-naïve NHP reuse and aims to stimulate further industry dialogue on the subject and provide guidance for pharmaceutical companies to establish roadmaps and decision trees enabling increased protein non-naïve NHP reuse. In addition, this paper represents a solid basis for collaborative engagement between pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies with contract research organizations (CROs) to discuss how the availability of protein non-naïve NHP within CROs can be better leveraged for their use within nonclinical studies.","3rs, nonhuman primate, preclinical safety, protein non-naive, reuse",International Journal Of Toxicology,iq consortium nhp reus work group wg compris member pharmaceut biotechnolog compani wg develop distribut detail questionnair protein nhp reus wg member compani wg receiv respons key stakehold includ princip investig facil manag anim welfar offic research scientist paper content reflect consolid opinion wg member questionnair respons subject nhp reus within nonclin program stage research develop mani pharmaceut compani repres work group particip questionnair alreadi achiev level nhp reus nonclin program survey result suggest signific potenti increas nhp reus need understand consider involv reus clearli wg also focus care inher concern risk implement protein nhp reus evalu best method risk assess paper present discus challeng opportun surround protein nhp reus aim stimul industri dialogu subject provid guidanc pharmaceut compani establish roadmap decis tree enabl increas protein nhp reus addit paper repres solid basi collabor engag pharmaceut biotechnolog compani contract research organ cro discus avail protein nhp within cro better leverag use within nonclin studi increas reus protein nonhuman primat pharmaceut drug discoveri develop overview industri posit challeng benefit
190,Toxicological Drug Screening using Paper Spray High-Resolution Tandem Mass Spectrometry (HR-MS/MS).,"Immunoassays and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) are both widely used methods for drug screening in toxicology. We investigated an alternative approach for rapid drug screening: paper spray MS (PS-MS). In paper spray, the biofluid sample is spotted onto a paper substrate. Upon application of a spray solvent and an electric potential, extraction and ionization occur directly from the paper without any need for additional sample preparation. We developed two paper spray high-resolution MS/MS targeted drug screening assays using a quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometer, one the positive ion mode and one in the negative ion mode. In the positive ion mode, over 130 drugs and drug metabolites were semi-quantitatively screened at sub-toxic concentrations in a single 2.5 min analysis. Limits of detection and calibration performances for each target compound are reported. The PS-MS/MS assay was tested on authentic postmortem specimens, and its screening ability and semi-quantitative performance were evaluated against independent LC-MS-MS screening and confirmation assays with good agreement. The paper spray MS/MS showed good qualitative agreement with LC-MS-MS; the true positive rate of paper spray MS/MS was 92%, and the true negative rate was over 98%. The quantitative results between the two methods were also acceptable for a screening application; Passing-Bablok regression yielded a slope of 1.17 and a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.996.

192,Rationalism and the disembodiment of modern childbirth: the case for an ecology of childbirth.,"The paper proposes a genealogy of the biomedical paradigm surrounding childbirth, with the aim of deconstructing the principles of rationalism that led to the objectification of the body and to the consequent commodification of birth. We intend to demonstrate how such a conception of the body and of sensibility determines the birth process, which leads us to consider it an event that is relational in nature. Methodologically, this deconstruction is carried out through a critical-descriptive genealogy of the theoretical assumptions of the rationalist conception of the body. By developing the concept of ecology of childbirth, we intend to call into question this relational nature of the body and to recover the value of corporeality and embodiment as a language of proximity, within a theoretical framework of the ethics of difference. This vindication of the ecological-relational nature of sensibility has the potential to establish a dynamic of responsibility and cooperation capable of subverting the rationalist logic of control and the dominion of the current biomedical paradigm.","birth, commodification, medicalization, obstetrics, social control",Salud Colectiva,paper propos genealog biomed paradigm surround childbirth aim deconstruct principl ration led objectif bodi consequ commodif birth intend demonstr concept bodi sensibl determin birth process lead u consid event relat natur methodolog deconstruct carri genealog theoret assumpt rationalist concept bodi develop concept ecolog childbirth intend call question relat natur bodi recov valu corpor embodi languag proxim within theoret framework ethic differ vindic natur sensibl potenti establish dynam respons cooper capabl subvert rationalist logic control dominion current biomed paradigm ration disembodi modern childbirth case ecolog childbirth
193,Distance and Microsphere Aggregation-Based DNA Detection in a Paper-Based Microfluidic Device.,"In paper-based microfluidics, the simplest devices are colorimetric, giving qualitative results. However, getting quantitative data can be quite a bit more difficult. Distance-based devices provide a user-friendly means of obtaining quantitative data without the need for any additional equipment, simply by using an included ruler or calibrated markings. This article details the development of a quantitative DNA detection device that utilizes the aggregation of polystyrene microspheres to affect the distance that microspheres wick through filter paper. The microspheres are conjugated to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) oligomers that are partially complementary to a target strand and, in the presence of the target strand, form a three-strand complex, resulting in the formation of aggregates. The higher the concentration of the target strand, the larger the aggregate, and the shorter the distance wicked by the microspheres. This behavior was investigated across a wide range of target concentrations and under different incubation times to understand aggregate formation. The device was then used to successfully detect a target strand spiked in extracted plant DNA.","dna detection, aggregation, distance-based, microsphere, paper-based",Slas Technology,microfluid simplest devic colorimetr give qualit result howev get quantit data quit bit difficult devic provid mean obtain quantit data without need addit equip simpli use includ ruler calibr mark articl detail develop quantit dna detect devic util aggreg polystyren microspher affect distanc microspher wick filter paper microspher conjug dna ssdna oligom partial complementari target strand presenc target strand form complex result format aggreg higher concentr target strand larger aggreg shorter distanc wick microspher behavior investig across wide rang target concentr differ incub time understand aggreg format devic use success detect target strand spike extract plant dna distanc microspher dna detect microfluid devic
194,How sociophenomenology of the body problematises the 'problem-oriented approach' to growth hormone treatment.,"This article examines how people who are shorter than average make sense of their lived experience of embodiment. It offers a sociophenomenological analysis of 10 semistructured interviews conducted in the Netherlands, focusing on if, how, and why height matters to them. It draws theoretically on phenomenological discussions of lived and objective space, intercorporeality and norms about bodies. The analysis shows that height as a lived phenomenon (1) is active engagement in space, (2) coshapes habituated ways of behaving and (3) is shaped by gendered norms and beliefs about height. Based on this analysis, the article challenges what we label as the 'problem-oriented approach' to discussions about growth hormone treatment for children with idiopathic short stature. In this approach, possible psychosocial disadvantages or problems of short stature and quantifiable height become central to the ethical evaluation of growth hormone treatment at the expense of first-hand lived experiences of short stature and height as a lived phenomenon. Based on our sociophenomenological analysis, this paper argues that the rationale for giving growth hormone treatment should combine medical and psychological assessments with investigations of lived experiences of the child. Such an approach would allow considerations not only of possible risks or disadvantages of short stature but also of the actual ways in which the child makes sense of her or his height.","child health, endocrinology including diabetes, medical ethics/bioethics, medical humanities, philosophy",Medical Humanities,articl examin peopl shorter averag make sen live experi embodi offer sociophenomenolog analysi semistructur interview conduct netherland focus height matter draw theoret phenomenolog discus live object space intercorpor norm bodi analysi show height live phenomenon activ engag space coshap habitu way behav shape gender norm belief height base analysi articl challeng label approach discus growth hormon treatment child idiopath short statur approach possibl psychosoci disadvantag problem short statur quantifi height becom central ethic evalu growth hormon treatment expens live experi short statur height live phenomenon base sociophenomenolog analysi paper argu rational give growth hormon treatment combin medic psycholog assess investig live experi child approach would allow consider possibl risk disadvantag short statur also actual way child make sen height sociophenomenolog bodi problematis approach growth hormon treatment
195,Teaching successful medication administration today: more than just knowing your 'rights'.,"Medication administration is an important skill taught in undergraduate nursing programs. Student learning for this activity includes not only how to prepare and administer medications, but also includes interventions such as patient and family teaching. Students also are taught a series of 'rights' in order to prevent medication errors. There are many factors, both personal and system related, which contribute to medication errors in the health care environment. The purpose of this article is to provide strategies for teaching students medication administration that encompass the multiple factors involved to ensure safe practice. This opinion paper is based on the authors' considerable years of teaching experience (35 years clinical setting and classroom teaching with senior students in final year of baccalaureate program for 1st author and 16 years total for co-author). Recommendations put forth by the authors are: a) leveling students' clinical experiences in administering medications to include understanding of system factors, b) structured scenarios and purposeful linking of theory to clinical courses to advance students' knowledge and skills related to medication administration as they progress through the program, 3) revisiting math skills.","medications, safety, strategies, students",Nurse Education In Practice,medic administr import skill taught undergradu nurs program student learn activ includ prepar administ medic also includ intervent patient famili teach student also taught seri order prevent medic error mani factor person system relat contribut medic error health care environ purpos articl provid strategi teach student medic administr encompass multipl factor involv ensur safe practic opinion paper base author consider year teach experi year clinic set classroom teach senior student final year baccalaur program author year total recommend put forth author level student clinic experi administ medic includ understand system factor b structur scenario purpos link theori clinic cours advanc student knowledg skill relat medic administr progress program revisit math skill teach success medic administr today know
196,Ionization Suppression and Recovery in Direct Biofluid Analysis Using Paper Spray Mass Spectrometry.,"Paper spray mass spectrometry is a method for the direct analysis of biofluid samples in which extraction of analytes from dried biofluid spots and electrospray ionization occur from the paper on which the dried sample is stored. We examined matrix effects in the analysis of small molecule drugs from urine, plasma, and whole blood. The general method was to spike stable isotope labeled analogs of each analyte into the spray solvent, while the analyte itself was in the dried biofluid. Intensity of the labeled analog is proportional to ionization efficiency, whereas the ratio of the analyte intensity to the labeled analog in the spray solvent is proportional to recovery. Ion suppression and recovery were found to be compound- and matrix-dependent. Highest levels of ion suppression were obtained for poor ionizers (e.g., analytes lacking basic aliphatic amine groups) in urine and approached -90%. Ion suppression was much lower or even absent for good ionizers (analytes with aliphatic amines) in dried blood spots. Recovery was generally highest in urine and lowest in blood. We also examined the effect of two experimental parameters on ion suppression and recovery: the spray solvent and the sample position (how far away from the paper tip the dried sample was spotted). Finally, the change in ion suppression and analyte elution as a function of time was examined by carrying out a paper spray analysis of dried plasma spots for 5 min by continually replenishing the spray solvent.

197,"""A midwife at every confinement"": Midwifery and Medicalized Childbirth in Ontario and Britain, 1920-1950.","This paper compares midwifery in Ontario and Britain in the first half of the 20th century. British midwives improved maternal and infant health and welfare by making childbirth a cooperative, medically managed event in conjunction with physicians. British midwives thus participated in, and contributed to, developments in obstetrics. In contrast, Ontario physicians worked to exclude midwives from participation in the modernization of birth management, relying on a narrower concept of ""medicalization"" defined as physician dominance. This study challenges the medical profession's assumptions that the exclusion of midwifery in Ontario was necessary to the medicalization of childbirth. The British alternative, where midwives were seen as partners rather than obstacles, illustrates that medicalization in the interest of infant and maternal safety could be integrated with the work of midwives.","midwifery, sage-femmerie, comparative medical history, histoire de la médecine comparée, medical professionalization, medicalization, médicalisation, professionalisation médicale",Canadian Bulletin Of Medical History = Bulletin Canadien D'Histoire De La Medecine,paper compar midwiferi ontario britain first half centuri british midwiv improv matern infant health welfar make childbirth cooper medic manag event conjunct physician british midwiv thu particip contribut develop obstetr contrast ontario physician work exclud midwiv particip modern birth manag reli narrow concept medic defin physician domin studi challeng medic profess assumpt exclus midwiferi ontario necessari medic childbirth british altern midwiv seen partner rather obstacl illustr medic interest infant matern safeti could integr work midwiv midwif everi confin midwiferi medic childbirth ontario britain
198,Hydrogel Paper-Based Analytical Devices: Separation-Free In Situ Assay of Small-Molecule Targets in Whole Blood.,"While colorimetric-based assays are very convenient to determine biomarkers in point-of-care testing (POCT), they often suffer from pretreatment procedures for separation of plasma or serum from whole blood samples. Here, we report a simple colorimetric paper-based analytical device (<i>c</i>-PAD) that is capable of performing sample-to-answer analysis by directly dropping the whole blood sample on paper. This is accomplished by utilizing sodium alginate hydrogel, which exhibits a nanometer-scale porous structure to effectively prevent the passage of large red blood cells and hemoglobin molecules, to encapsulate enzymes and chromogenic reagents. As the small targets in the blood sample enter the sensing region to trigger a chromogenic reaction, the resulting color signal is recorded by a smartphone. The interference from the red blood to the color signal can be completely avoided without the requirement of any separation process. The analytical performance of the method is evaluated by assaying glucose in real blood samples. The results show that rapid and accurate analysis can be achieved with the limit of detection as low as 0.12 mM. In addition, simultaneous detection of different targets (glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides) in whole blood can be achieved by fabricating <i>c</i>-PAD with multiple sensing regions. Owing to its several essential advantages including an extremely simple procedure for fabrication, sample-to-answer analysis without tedious pretreatment, and capability to perform high-throughput analysis, the proposed <i>c-</i>PAD will be of great value in POCT applications of whole blood samples.",no keywords,Analytical Chemistry,assay conveni determin biomark test poct often suffer pretreat procedur separ plasma serum whole blood sampl report simpl colorimetr analyt devic c capabl perform analysi directli drop whole blood sampl paper accomplish util sodium algin hydrogel exhibit porou structur effect prevent passag larg red blood cell hemoglobin molecul encapsul enzym chromogen reagent small target blood sampl enter sen region trigger chromogen reaction result color signal record smartphon interfer red blood color signal complet avoid without requir separ process analyt perform method evalu assay glucos real blood sampl result show rapid accur analysi achiev limit detect low mm addit simultan detect differ target glucos cholesterol triglycerid whole blood achiev fabric c multipl sen region owe sever essenti advantag includ extrem simpl procedur fabric analysi without tediou pretreat capabl perform analysi propos pad great valu poct applic whole blood sampl hydrogel analyt devic situ assay target whole blood
199,'I just need to know what they are and if you can help me': Medicalization and the search for legitimacy in people diagnosed with non-epileptic attack disorder.,"This paper focuses on the struggles for legitimacy expressed by people with non-epileptic attack disorder (NEAD), one of the most common manifestations of functional neurological disorder presenting to emergency and secondary care services. Nonepileptic attacks are episodes of altered experience, awareness, and reduced self-control that superficially resemble epileptic seizures or other paroxysmal disorders but are not associated with physiological abnormalities sufficient to explain the semiological features. ""Organic"" or medicalized explanations are frequently sought by patients as the only legitimate explanation for symptoms, and consequently, a diagnosis of NEAD is often contested. Drawing on narrative interviews with patients from a small exploratory study and using a sociological perspective, we propose that a psychological account of NEAD does not provide a sufficiently legitimate path into a socially sanctioned sick role. This is a reflection of the dominance of biomedicine and the associated processes of medicalization. These processes are, we argue, the sole route to achieving legitimacy. The stress-based or psychologically oriented explanations offered to patients in contemporary medical models of the etiology of NEAD engender an uncertain identity and social position and fail to provide many patients with an account of the nature or origin of their symptoms that they find satisfactory or convincing. These struggles for legitimacy (shared by others with functional or somatoform conditions) are sharpened by key features of the contemporary healthcare landscape, such as the increasing framing of health through a lens of 'responsibilization'.","functional seizures, legitimacy, medicalization, non-epileptic attack disorder (nead)",Epilepsy & Behavior : E&B,paper focus struggl legitimaci express peopl attack disord nead one common manifest function neurolog disord present emerg secondari care servic nonepilept attack episod alter experi awar reduc superfici resembl epilept seizur paroxysm disord associ physiolog abnorm suffici explain semiolog featur organ medic explan frequent sought patient legitim explan symptom consequ diagnosi nead often contest draw narr interview patient small exploratori studi use sociolog perspect propos psycholog account nead provid suffici legitim path social sanction sick role reflect domin biomedicin associ process medic process argu sole rout achiev legitimaci psycholog orient explan offer patient contemporari medic model etiolog nead engend uncertain ident social posit fail provid mani patient account natur origin symptom find satisfactori convinc struggl legitimaci share other function somatoform condit sharpen key featur contemporari healthcar landscap increas frame health len need know help medic search legitimaci peopl diagnos attack disord
200,Paper test cards for presumptive testing of very low quality antimalarial medications.,"Carrying out chemical analysis of antimalarials to detect low-quality medications before they reach a patient is a costly venture. Here, we show that a library of chemical color tests embedded on a paper card can presumptively identify formulations corresponding to very low quality antimalarial drugs. The presence or absence of chloroquine (CQ), doxycycline (DOX), quinine, sulfadoxine, pyrimethamine, and primaquine antimalarial medications, in addition to fillers used in low-quality pharmaceuticals, are indicated by patterns of colors that are generated on the test cards. Test card sensitivity for detection of these pure components ranges from 90% to 100% with no false positives in the absence of pharmaceutical. The color intensities from reactions characteristic of CQ or DOX allowed visual detection of formulations of these medications cut with 60% or 100% filler, although samples cut with 30% filler could not be reliably detected colorimetrically. However, the addition of unexpected fillers, even in 30% quantities, or substitute pharmaceuticals, could sometimes be detected by other color reactions on the test cards. Tests are simple and inexpensive enough to be carried out in clinics, pharmacies, and ports of entry and could provide a screening method to presumptively indicate very low quality medicines throughout the supply chain.",no keywords,The American Journal Of Tropical Medicine And Hygiene,carri chemic analysi antimalari detect medic reach patient costli ventur show librari chemic color test embed paper card presumpt identifi formul correspond low qualiti antimalari drug presenc absenc chloroquin cq doxycyclin dox quinin sulfadoxin pyrimethamin primaquin antimalari medic addit filler use pharmaceut indic pattern color gener test card test card sensit detect pure compon rang fals posit absenc pharmaceut color intens reaction characterist cq dox allow visual detect formul medic cut filler although sampl cut filler could reliabl detect colorimetr howev addit unexpect filler even quantiti substitut pharmaceut could sometim detect color reaction test card test simpl inexpens enough carri clinic pharmaci port entri could provid screen method presumpt indic low qualiti medicin throughout suppli chain paper test card presumpt test low qualiti antimalari medic

In this paper, we therefore engage with the reader in a critical analysis that exposes the tensions that exist between individual experiences of distress and psychiatric pathologization. The first section of the paper is dedicated to the presentation of a theoretical framework in which we explore the medicalization process and the ontological issues regarding psychiatric diagnoses. The second section seeks to present the results from a qualitative research study in the field of HIV/AIDS nursing and serves as a case example to foster discussions on the implications of psychiatric pathologization in clinical practice.","hiv/aids, medicalization, nursing, pathologization, psychiatry, women",Journal Of Psychiatric And Mental Health Nursing,paper precis aim expo limit psychiatri scientif explor psychiatr diagnos come util practic affect becom patholog draw research find field nurs portray impact psychiatr patholog woman see bodi transform antiretrovir therapi subsequ must accept respons chang becom target psychiatr label intervent paper therefor engag reader critic analysi expo tension exist individu experi distress psychiatr patholog first section paper dedic present theoret framework explor medic process ontolog issu regard psychiatr diagnos second section seek present result qualit research studi field nurs serv case exampl foster discus implic psychiatr patholog clinic practic distress ill critic analysi medic effect clinic practic
202,The impending globalization of ADHD: notes on the expansion and growth of a medicalized disorder.,"Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) has been medicalized in the United States since the 1960s. Primarily used in North America until the 1990s, ADHD diagnosis and treatment have increasingly been applied internationally. After documenting the expansion of ADHD in a global context, this paper presents five brief international examples examining ADHD usage and expansion: the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy and Brazil. We then identify and describe several vehicles that facilitate the migration of the ADHD diagnosis: the transnational pharmaceutical industry; the influence of western psychiatry; moving from ICD to DSM diagnostic criteria; the role of the Internet including the related advent of easily accessible online screening checklists; and advocacy groups. Finally, we discuss what this globalization of a diagnosis reflects about the potential global medicalization of other conditions.","adhd, dsm, diagnosis, globalization, icd, medicalization",Social Science & Medicine (1982),attent deficit hyperact disord adhd medic unit state sinc primarili use north america adhd diagnosi treatment increasingli appli intern document expans adhd global context paper present five brief intern exampl examin adhd usag expans unit kingdom germani franc itali brazil identifi describ sever vehicl facilit migrat adhd diagnosi transnat pharmaceut industri influenc western psychiatri move icd dsm diagnost criterion role internet includ relat advent easili access onlin screen checklist advocaci group final discus global diagnosi reflect potenti global medic condit impend global adhd note expans growth medic disord
203,Paper spray tandem mass spectrometry: A rapid approach for the assay of parabens in cosmetics and drugs.,"A fast methodology for the assay of parabens in drug and cosmetic preparations has been presented. The procedure developed is based on paper spray tandem mass spectrometry and isotope dilution approach. For each investigated paraben, the corresponding labeled standard has been used in order to improve the accuracy and reproducibility of the analyses. The MS experiments have been performed under MRM conditions, monitoring the transitions [M-H]<sup>-</sup> → m/z 92 and [M-H]<sup>-</sup> → m/z 98, respectively, for each analyte and the corresponding labeled internal standard. The quantitative assay has been performed using a calibration curve built from 2 to 15 mg/L. The method accuracy, in all case near 100%, was evaluated using fortified samples at two concentration levels, which are representative of the lower and the higher portion of calibration curve. The good values of LOQ, LOD, and reproducibility confirm the consistency of the developed approach.","cosmetics, drugs, labeled internal standards, paper spray ionization, parabens, tandem mass spectrometry",Journal Of Mass Spectrometry : Jms,fast methodolog assay paraben drug cosmet prepar present procedur develop base paper spray tandem mass spectrometri isotop dilut approach investig paraben correspond label standard use order improv accuraci reproduc analys m experi perform mrm condit monitor transit sup sup respect analyt correspond label intern standard quantit assay perform use calibr curv built method accuraci case near evalu use fortifi sampl two concentr level repres lower higher portion calibr curv good valu loq lod reproduc confirm consist develop approach paper spray tandem mass spectrometri rapid approach assay paraben cosmet drug
204,Chronic relationships and mental health care: global pharmaceuticals in a local healing shrine in India.,"The paper explores how chronicities and chronic relationships are fostered at a state-sponsored community psychiatry clinic that has been affiliated with a Sufi shrine in western India. The clinic provides free psychotropic treatment to patients, most of whom are pilgrims visiting the shrine. While the clinic has been lauded for its collaborative approach of blending 'medicine and prayer' in the provision of mental health care, observations of clinical encounters reflect the prevalence of a strongly medicalized perspective of mental illness, where local narratives of distress are reframed as globalized categories of mental disorder, thereby permitting pharmacological intervention. Importantly, in a context where free medicines are offered just as other freebies are in development initiatives in India, this results in the creation of long-term, 'chronic' relationships with patients who only seem to return for medicines, never recovering. This paper illustrates how 'chronicity', in many ways, is built into the project from the beginning itself. It becomes evident in the assumptions of the officials and psychiatrists that mental illness is chronic, in the case files of patients that record their consultation and medication histories, and in the clinical conversations about the importance of compliance to treatment. Given that historically, community mental health emerged in the context of reducing long hospital stays and deinstitutionalizing mental health care, it is important to reflect on how these policies and practices result in the creation of a cadre of chronic out-patients.","chronicities, care, pharmaceuticals, ritual, somatization",Anthropology & Medicine,paper explor chronic chronic relationship foster commun psychiatri clinic affili sufi shrine western india clinic provid free psychotrop treatment patient pilgrim visit shrine clinic laud collabor approach blend prayer provis mental health care observ clinic encount reflect preval strongli medic perspect mental ill local narr distress refram global categori mental disord therebi permit pharmacolog intervent importantli context free medicin offer freebi develop initi india result creation relationship patient seem return medicin never recov paper illustr mani way built project begin becom evid assumpt offici psychiatrist mental ill chronic case file patient record consult medic histori clinic convers import complianc treatment given histor commun mental health emerg context reduc long hospit stay deinstitution mental health care import reflect polici practic result creation cadr chronic chronic relationship mental health care global pharmaceut local heal shrine india
205,Integration of mental health into primary healthcare in low-income countries: avoiding medicalization.,"Since 2008 the World Health Organization (WHO), through its mental health Gap Action Programme, has attempted to revitalize efforts to integrate mental health into non-specialized (e.g. primary) healthcare. While this has led to renewed interest in this potential method of mental health service delivery, it has also prompted criticism. Some concerns raised are that it would contribute to the medicalization of social and psychological problems, and narrowly focus on primary care without sufficient attention given to strengthening other levels of the healthcare system, notably community-based care and care on district levels. This paper discusses seven elements that may be critical to preventing inadvertently contributing to increasing a narrow biomedical approach to mental healthcare when integrating mental health into non-specialized healthcare: (1) using task shifting approaches within a system of stepped care, (2) ensuring primary mental healthcare also includes brief psychotherapeutic interventions, (3) promote community-based recovery-oriented interventions for people with disabling chronic mental disorders, (4) conceptualizing training as a continuous process of strengthening clinical competencies through supervision, (5) engaging communities as partners in psychosocial interventions, (6) embedding shifts to primary mental healthcare within wider health policy reforms, and (7) promoting inter-sectoral approaches to address social determinants of mental health.",no keywords,"International Review Of Psychiatry (Abingdon, England)",sinc world health organ mental health gap action programm attempt revit effort integr mental health primari healthcar led renew interest potenti method mental health servic deliveri also prompt critic concern rais would contribut medic social psycholog problem narrowli focu primari care without suffici attent given strengthen level healthcar system notabl care care district level paper discus seven element may critic prevent inadvert contribut increas narrow biomed approach mental healthcar integr mental health healthcar use task shift approach within system step care ensur primari mental healthcar also includ brief psychotherapeut intervent promot intervent peopl disabl chronic mental disord conceptu train continu process strengthen clinic compet supervis engag commun partner psychosoci intervent embed shift primari mental healthcar within wider health polici reform promot approach address social determin mental health integr mental health primari healthcar countri avoid medic

207,Trace evidence dynamics of cocaine on banknotes: A comparison study of paper and polymer banknotes.,"It is well established that a large proportion of paper banknotes in circulation contain traces of cocaine. Being able to discriminate between the innocent transfer of illicit drug particles acquired through everyday interactions with surfaces such as banknotes, as opposed to transfer resulting from criminal activities can provide valuable intelligence that can inform an investigation. With many countries adopting polymer banknotes as legal tender, it is important to consider the transfer of cocaine from these surfaces as well as the retention of these particulates on polymer banknotes for evaluative interpretation in crime reconstruction. This comparison study assessed three contact variables (force, time, and rotation) on the transfer of cocaine particulates from paper and polymer banknotes onto a human skin proxy. The persistence of cocaine particulates was assessed through a realistic scenario which mimicked a cash transaction. Quantifiable amounts of cocaine were transferred onto the human skin proxy across all of the contacts assessed, with a greater transfer observed with contacts involving polymer banknotes and those contacts which involved rotation. Following extensive handling, cocaine persisted on both banknote types, with paper banknotes retaining larger amounts of cocaine than polymer banknotes. These findings show that cocaine can persist on both paper and polymer banknotes for extended periods of time following handling and is therefore available for transfer. This transfer then readily occurs, even when contact is brief and involves relatively small forces. A key distinction between the banknote types was that cocaine particulates are more likely to transfer from polymer banknotes due to the lower retention rate of particulates on this surface. Such insights can aid in evaluating the relevance of illicit drug particles identified on items or persons of interest in crime reconstruction approaches.","crime reconstruction, experimental studies, forensic science, instron electropuls, persistence, transfer",Science & Justice : Journal Of The Forensic Science Society,well establish larg proport paper banknot circul contain trace cocain abl discrimin innoc transfer illicit drug particl acquir everyday interact surfac banknot oppos transfer result crimin activ provid valuabl intellig inform investig mani countri adopt polym banknot legal tender import consid transfer cocain surfac well retent particul polym banknot evalu interpret crime reconstruct comparison studi assess three contact variabl forc time rotat transfer cocain particul paper polym banknot onto human skin proxi persist cocain particul assess realist scenario mimick cash transact quantifi amount cocain transfer onto human skin proxi across contact assess greater transfer observ contact involv polym banknot contact involv rotat follow extens handl cocain persist banknot type paper banknot retain larger amount cocain polym banknot find show cocain persist paper polym banknot extend period time follow handl therefor avail transfer transfer readili occur even contact brief involv rel small forc key distinct banknot type cocain particul like transfer polym banknot due lower retent rate particul surfac insight aid evalu relev illicit drug particl identifi item person interest crime reconstruct approach trace evid dynam cocain banknot comparison studi paper polym banknot
208,[The medicalization of life: hybrids against the dichotomy Nature/Culture].,"This paper aims to analyze the process of medicalization in current societies, starting from the description of the way in which medicine gradually appropriated various aspects of everyday life that were once part of the life cycle of people. At the theoretical level, we are based on authors such as Descola and Latour, who problematize the dichotomy between Nature and Culture, and propose the need to think from a superior episteme. Methodologically, this theoretical proposal enables an analysis of the medicalization that can illuminate what is hidden in the discourse and biomedical practices: the sociocultural, political and economic processes that are part of these ""objects"" of Medicine. From this perspective, the presentation of them as scientific facts, objectively isolatable and manipulable by medical science, is in crisis. Thus, our analysis, based on the concept of ""quasi-objects"" or ""hybrids"", problematizes such objectification, while providing critical tools to reflect on the medicalization of life in today's societies.",no keywords,Ciencia & Saude Coletiva,paper aim analyz process medic current societi start descript way medicin gradual appropri variou aspect everyday life part life cycl peopl theoret level base author descola latour problemat dichotomi natur cultur propos need think superior epistem methodolog theoret propos enabl analysi medic illumin hidden discours biomed practic sociocultur polit econom process part object medicin perspect present scientif fact object isolat manipul medic scienc crisi thu analysi base concept hybrid problemat objectif provid critic tool reflect medic life today societi medic life hybrid dichotomi
209,Paper-based microreactor array for rapid screening of cell signaling cascades.,"Investigation of cell signaling pathways is important for the study of pathogenesis of cancer. However, the related operations used in these studies are time consuming and labor intensive. Thus, the development of effective therapeutic strategies may be hampered. In this work, gel-free cell culture and subsequent immunoassay has been successfully integrated and conducted in a paper-based microreactor array. Study of the activation level of different kinases of cells stimulated by different conditions, i.e., IL-6 stimulation, starvation, and hypoxia, was demonstrated. Moreover, rapid screening of cell signaling cascades after the stimulations of HGF, doxorubicin, and UVB irradiation was respectively conducted to simultaneously screen 40 kinases and transcription factors. Activation of multi-signaling pathways could be identified and the correlation between signaling pathways was discussed to provide further information to investigate the entire signaling network. The present technique integrates most of the tedious operations using a single paper substrate, reduces sample and reagent consumption, and shortens the time required by the entire process. Therefore, it provides a first-tier rapid screening tool for the study of complicated signaling cascades. It is expected that the technique can be developed for routine protocol in conventional biological research laboratories.",no keywords,Lab On A Chip,investig cell signal pathway import studi pathogenesi cancer howev relat oper use studi time consum labor intens thu develop effect therapeut strategi may hamper work cell cultur subsequ immunoassay success integr conduct microreactor array studi activ level differ kina cell stimul differ condit stimul starvat hypoxia demonstr moreov rapid screen cell signal cascad stimul hgf doxorubicin uvb irradi respect conduct simultan screen kina transcript factor activ pathway could identifi correl signal pathway discus provid inform investig entir signal network present techniqu integr tediou oper use singl paper substrat reduc sampl reagent consumpt shorten time requir entir process therefor provid rapid screen tool studi complic signal cascad expect techniqu develop routin protocol convent biolog research laboratori microreactor array rapid screen cell signal cascad
210,Janus Electrochemical Paper-Based Analytical Devices for Metals Detection in Aerosol Samples.,"Exposure to trace metals in airborne particulate matter (PM) has been linked to various adverse health effects. Quantifying metals in PM is important; however, current analytical tools tend to be bulky and expensive. A need therefore exists for more rapid, low-cost, portable tools for multiplexed determination of metals in PM. Electrochemical paper-based devices (ePADs) have been used for detecting metals in PM but require different devices and methods for different metals, making the systems more complicated than desired. Recently reported Janus ePADs offer a solution to this problem by allowing for multiple electrochemical experiments from a single sample. Here, we sought to determine if a Janus ePAD containing four independent channels and working electrodes could be used for simultaneous detection of multiple metals in PM. Online sample pretreatment in each channel during sample delivery yielded optimal conditions for each experiment. The design allows the device to conduct square-wave anodic stripping voltammetry (SWASV) and square-wave cathodic stripping voltammetry (SWCSV) for simultaneous detection of Cd, Pb, Cu, Fe, and Ni from a single sample. Two detection zones each with shared reference and counter electrodes were used for SWASV and SWCSV, respectively. The proposed sensors reached LODs down to 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, and 1.0 μg L<sup>-1</sup>, for Cd(II), Pb(II), Cu(II), Fe(II), and Ni(II), respectively. The linear working ranges were 0.5-400.0 μg L<sup>-1</sup> for Cd(II), Pb(II), and Fe(II), 1.0-400.0 μg L<sup>-1</sup> for Cu(II), and 0.5-200.0 μg L<sup>-1</sup> for Ni(II). The devices were applied for Cd(II), Pb(II), Cu(II), Fe(II), and Ni(II) determination in PM samples, and the results agreed with those using traditional ICP-MS analyses at 95% confidence.",no keywords,Analytical Chemistry,exposur trace metal airborn particul matter pm link variou advers health effect quantifi metal pm import howev current analyt tool tend bulki expens need therefor exist rapid portabl tool multiplex determin metal pm electrochem devic epad use detect metal pm requir differ devic method differ metal make system complic desir recent report janu epad offer solut problem allow multipl electrochem experi singl sampl sought determin janu epad contain four independ channel work electrod could use simultan detect multipl metal pm onlin sampl pretreat channel sampl deliveri yield optim condit experi design allow devic conduct anod strip voltammetri swasv cathod strip voltammetri swcsv simultan detect cd pb cu fe ni singl sampl two detect zone share refer counter electrod use swasv swcsv respect propos sensor reach lod μg l sup cd ii pb ii cu ii fe ii ni ii respect linear work rang μg l sup cd ii pb ii fe ii μg l sup cu ii μg l sup ni ii devic appli cd ii pb ii cu ii fe ii ni ii determin pm sampl result agre use tradit analys confid janu electrochem analyt devic metal detect aerosol sampl
211,Chemical and statistical analyses of blotter paper matrix drugs seized in the State of Rio de Janeiro.,"Drugs of abuse are psychoactive substances illicitly distributed and used worldwide. In Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, they represent a public health issue and are directly related to several social problems. The recent increase in appearances of new psychoactive substances (NPS), derived from structural modifications of existing psychoactive substances, poses a threat to public health and forensic laboratories worldwide, as little is known about these substances. This study aimed to chemically and geographically map drugs of abuse from blotter papers seized by the Civil Police of Rio de Janeiro State (PCERJ) between 2006 and 2019. High-performance analytical techniques, such as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and Orbitrap mass spectrometry (Orbitrap-MS), combined with statistical analyses, were employed to characterize the seized samples. The most common chemical compounds in NPS found in this study were synthetic phenethylamines, i.e., molecules from the 25I-NBOH (2-(((4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethyl)amino)methyl)phenol) and 25I-NBOMe (2-(4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)ethanamine) families. Prior to 2014, the majority of seized blotter papers contained lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and were concentrated in the Metropolitan region. An upsurge in blotter paper seizures was observed from 2014 to 2017; the most common substances during this time were from the NBOMe family. NBOH compounds emerged in 2016 in coastal regions with high tourism, reaching over 1300 items only in 2017. Only one synthetic cannabinoid was found among the blotter papers seized in Rio de Janeiro between 2006 and 2019. The assembled chemical data and statistical analyses allowed the mapping and monitoring of the chemical profiles of the seized blotter papers, providing a strong foundation for the understanding of the origins and movement of these drugs around the RJ State.","25i-nboh, 25i-nbome, designer drugs, gc–ms, orbitrap-ms, statistical analysis",Forensic Science International,drug abus psychoact substanc illicitli distribut use worldwid rio de janeiro brazil repres public health issu directli relat sever social problem recent increas appear new psychoact substanc np deriv structur modif exist psychoact substanc pose threat public health forens laboratori worldwid littl known substanc studi aim chemic geograph map drug abus blotter paper seiz civil polic rio de janeiro state pcerj analyt techniqu ga spectrometri orbitrap mass spectrometri combin statist analys employ character seiz sampl common chemic compound np found studi synthet phenethylamin molecul amino methyl phenol ethanamin famili prior major seiz blotter paper contain lyserg acid diethylamid lsd concentr metropolitan region upsurg blotter paper seizur observ common substanc time nbome famili nboh compound emerg coastal region high tourism reach item one synthet cannabinoid found among blotter paper seiz rio de janeiro assembl chemic data statist analys allow map monitor chemic profil seiz blotter paper provid strong foundat understand origin movement drug around rj state chemic statist analys blotter paper matrix drug seiz state rio de janeiro
212,"Development, characterization, and application of paper spray ionization.","Paper spray is developed as a direct sampling ionization method for mass spectrometric analysis of complex mixtures. Ions of analyte are generated by applying a high voltage to a paper triangle wetted with a small volume (<10 microL) of solution. Samples can be preloaded onto the paper, added with the wetting solution, or transferred from surfaces using the paper as a wipe. It is demonstrated that paper spray is applicable to the analysis of a wide variety of compounds, including small organic compounds, peptides, and proteins. Procedures are developed for analysis of dried biofluid spots and applied to therapeutic drug monitoring with whole blood samples and to illicit drug detection in raw urine samples. Limits of detection of 50 ng/mL (or 20 pg absolute) are achieved for atenolol in bovine blood. The combination of sample collection from surfaces and paper spray ionization also enables fast chemical screening at high sensitivity, for example 100 pg of heroin distributed on a surface and agrochemicals on fruit peels are detectable. Online derivatization with a preloaded reagent is demonstrated for analysis of cholesterol in human serum.

New psychoactive substances including novel benzodiazepines in the illicit drug supply have been linked to high rates of overdose deaths while complicating drug checking as an overdose prevention strategy. Paper-spray mass spectrometry (PS-MS) has emerged as a novel strategy to rapidly detect trace components in street drug samples. While targeted, low-resolution PS-MS methods have proven effective, newly emerging substances are often missed. To address this, a method was applied to low-resolution full-scan PS-MS data to aid in the early detection and identification of novel benzodiazepines in the unregulated drug supply. Using the developed method, true positives rates of 0.89 and 0.75 were achieved for bromazolam and etizolam in street samples obtained in a community drug checking service. The applicability of the method was further demonstrated for a novel benzodiazepine, desalkylgidazepam, that has recently emerged in the illicit drug supply.","drug checking, paper‐spray mass spectrometry, point‐of‐care",Drug Testing And Analysis,abil detect newli emerg substanc great import reduc harm peopl use drug new psychoact substanc includ novel benzodiazepin illicit drug suppli link high rate overdos death complic drug check overdos prevent strategi mass spectrometri emerg novel strategi rapidli detect trace compon street drug sampl target method proven effect newli emerg substanc often miss address method appli data aid earli detect identif novel benzodiazepin unregul drug suppli use develop method true posit rate achiev bromazolam etizolam street sampl obtain commun drug check servic applic method demonstr novel benzodiazepin desalkylgidazepam recent emerg illicit drug suppli strategi detect benzodiazepin drug use mass spectrometri harm reduct drug check
215,Eco-friendly plasmonic sensors: using the photothermal effect to prepare metal nanoparticle-containing test papers for highly sensitive colorimetric detection.,"Convenient, rapid, and accurate detection of chemical and biomolecules would be a great benefit to medical, pharmaceutical, and environmental sciences. Many chemical and biosensors based on metal nanoparticles (NPs) have been developed. However, as a result of the inconvenience and complexity of most of the current preparation techniques, surface plasmon-based test papers are not as common as, for example, litmus paper, which finds daily use. In this paper, we propose a convenient and practical technique, based on the photothermal effect, to fabricate the plasmonic test paper. This technique is superior to other reported methods for its rapid fabrication time (a few seconds), large-area throughput, selectivity in the positioning of the NPs, and the capability of preparing NP arrays in high density on various paper substrates. In addition to their low cost, portability, flexibility, and biodegradability, plasmonic test paper can be burned after detecting contagious biomolecules, making them safe and eco-friendly.",no keywords,Analytical Chemistry,conveni rapid accur detect chemic biomolecul would great benefit medic pharmaceut environment scienc mani chemic biosensor base metal nanoparticl np develop howev result inconveni complex current prepar techniqu surfac test paper common exampl litmu paper find daili use paper propos conveni practic techniqu base phototherm effect fabric plasmon test paper techniqu superior report method rapid fabric time second throughput select posit np capabl prepar np array high densiti variou paper substrat addit low cost portabl flexibl biodegrad plasmon test paper burn detect contagi biomolecul make safe plasmon sensor use phototherm effect prepar metal test paper highli sensit colorimetr detect
216,"Defending the indefensible? Psychiatry, assisted suicide and human freedom.","The siege guns of the forces for change to euthanasia and assisted suicide laws have been pounding for decades, but the longstanding proscription on these practices has held out in all but a few jurisdictions. A few psychiatrists have enlisted with the challengers, but many remain on the battlements, defending the impermissibility of active assistance in dying. Given the long history of the separation of church and state and the significant secularisation of society; the recognition by the law of both acts and omissions as legal causes; lenient sentences for mercy killers; critiques of the ""psychiatriatisation"" of different aspects of life; and the consistency of public opinion, this recalcitrant stand bespeaks undercurrents and positions that are often by rationalised or camouflaged, and which call for exploration. In this paper, I examine connections between psychiatry and conceptualisations of harm, suffering and natural death; medicalisation, psychiatrisation and medical paternalism; decision-making capacity, rationality and diagnosis; recent legal developments; social pluralism; and religious intuitionism. I conclude that psychiatrists and the psychiatry profession, concerned as they are with enlarging the province of human freedom, should begin a more transparent rapprochement with those they would repel.","acts and omissions, euthanasia, freedom, medicalisation, psychiatry, religion",International Journal Of Law And Psychiatry,sieg gun forc chang euthanasia assist suicid law pound decad longstand proscript practic held jurisdict psychiatrist enlist challeng mani remain battlement defend impermiss activ assist die given long histori separ church state signific secularis societi recognit law act omiss legal caus lenient sentenc merci killer critiqu psychiatriatis differ aspect life consist public opinion recalcitr stand bespeak undercurr posit often rationalis camouflag call explor paper examin connect psychiatri conceptualis harm suffer natur death medicalis psychiatris medic patern capac ration diagnosi recent legal develop social plural religi intuition conclud psychiatrist psychiatri profess concern enlarg provinc human freedom begin transpar rapproch would repel defend indefens psychiatri assist suicid human freedom
217,Terahertz-spectroscopy for non-destructive determination of crystallinity of L-tartaric acid in smartFilms® and tablets made from paper.,"Newly developed active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) often experience low solubility in aqueous media and thus possess poor oral bioavailability. The SmartFilm®-technology is a novel approach to overcome poor solubility. The technique uses commercial paper in which API can be loaded in amorphous state, thus increasing dissolution rate dc/dt and solubility c<sub>s</sub> when compared to bulk material. However, the preservation of the amorphous state is a prerequisite for an efficient use of the smartFilm-technology and thus the crystalline state needs to be inspected during storage. Preferably, this should be done non-destructively. Traditional techniques, such as x-ray diffraction (XRD) or differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), do not allow for non-destructive crystallinity investigations, whereas Terahertz (THz) spectroscopy is a non-destructive technique, that is sensitive to the crystalline state of many molecular crystals. Therefore, the potential of THz-spectroscopy for crystallinity state inspection of API in smartFilms and tablets made from smartFilms was investigated in this study. The THz results obtained were compared to results obtained from XRD and DSC measurements. Whereas DSC measurements failed to reliably detect crystalline API in the smartFilms, XRD and THz-spectroscopy showed similar results and revealed that it was possible to prepare smartFilms loaded with >23% (w/w) amorphous API. Results indicate the great potential of THz spectroscopy for the non-destructive determination of the crystalline state of APIs in smartFilms and/or tablets made from paper.","amorphous state, crystallinity, paper, porous material, solubility, terahertz spectroscopy",International Journal Of Pharmaceutics,newli develop activ pharmaceut ingredi api often experi low solubl aqueou medium thu possess poor oral bioavail novel approach overcom poor solubl techniqu use commerci paper api load amorph state thu increas dissolut rate solubl c sub compar bulk materi howev preserv amorph state prerequisit effici use thu crystallin state need inspect storag prefer done tradit techniqu diffract xrd differenti scan calorimetri dsc allow crystallin investig wherea terahertz thz spectroscopi techniqu sensit crystallin state mani molecular crystal therefor potenti crystallin state inspect api smartfilm tablet made smartfilm investig studi thz result obtain compar result obtain xrd dsc measur wherea dsc measur fail reliabl detect crystallin api smartfilm xrd show similar result reveal possibl prepar smartfilm load amorph api result indic great potenti thz spectroscopi determin crystallin state api smartfilm tablet made paper determin crystallin acid tablet made paper

In this study, cinnamon essential oil (CEO)/soybean protein isolate (SPI) microcapsules were prepared by the coagulation method, and their properties were optimized. Then, the microcapsules were added to konjac glucomannan (KGM) as a coating solution to enhance the physical, and chemical properties of kraft paper by a coating method. The release behavior of CEO, tensile properties, antibacterial properties and preservation effects of the paper were investigated. The results show that when the ratio of wall to core was 7:3, the highest encapsulation rate was 92.20 ± 0.43 %. The coating treatment significantly reduced the oxygen and water vapor transmission rates of kraft paper. The shelf life of citrus treated with coated Kraft was extended by >10 days.

The reaction between H2S gas and the current sensor produces a visible color change from white to yellow/brown, and the sensor responds to ≥ 30 ppb H2S in a total volume of 1.35 L of gas, a typical volume of human breath. The alkaline, wet coating helps the trapping of acidic H2S gas and its reaction with Bi(III) species, forming colored Bi2S3. The sensor is suitable for testing human bad breath and is at least 2 orders of magnitude more sensitive than a commercial H2S test paper based on Pb(II)(acetate)2. The small volume of 1.35-L H2S is important, as the commercial Pb(II)(acetate)2-based paper requires large volumes of 5 ppm H2S gas. The new sensor reported here is inexpensive, disposable, safe, and user-friendly. A simple, laboratory setup for generating small volumes of ppb-ppm of H2S gas is also reported.",no keywords,Analytical Chemistry,new sensor detect hydrogen sulfid ga develop replac commerci lead ii test paper new sensor wet porou substrat coat bi oh alkalin deriv ph contrast neurotox lead ii acet bismuth use due nontox properti bi iii reagent medic reaction ga current sensor produc visibl color chang white sensor respond ppb total volum l ga typic volum human breath alkalin wet coat help trap acid ga reaction bi iii speci form color sensor suitabl test human bad breath least order magnitud sensit commerci test paper base pb ii acet small volum import commerci pb ii acet paper requir larg volum ppm ga new sensor report inexpens dispos safe simpl laboratori setup gener small volum ga also report dispos sensor detect hydrogen sulfid ga

221,Emerging contaminants as unintentional substances in paper and board: A case of unexpected pharmaceuticals detection in the paper recycling chain.,"The contamination of paper products by various chemicals has been reported on a global level, but to date, no published research has investigated pharmaceutical contamination of paper-based products. In this study, pharmaceutical analysis was conducted on 42 samples collected from various points of the recycled paper value chain in Cape Town, South Africa, which included the various grades that may be included in the manufacturing of recycled paperboard. The analysis was achieved by ultrasonic-assisted extraction of paper samples before detection by UHPLC-Q Orbitrap. Quantification limits ranged from 1.15 pg/g for ketoprofen to 46.07 pg/g for methocarbamol. Pharmaceuticals identified in newspaper samples were dexamethasone, ketoprofen, and 17β-estradiol. The latter was also detected in paper shopping bags (up to 697.49 ng/g), infant bathtub packaging (280.62 ng/g), battery packaging (137.43 ng/g), and an egg carton (170.47 ng/g). Carbamazepine was also prominent with its concentration reaching 13.02 ng/g in a vegetable box. Suspect screening tentatively identified 14 additional pharmaceuticals in paper samples, with minocycline, prazepam, and anabolic steroids appearing more prominently. This pioneering study indicated that unintentional pharmaceutical exposure had expanded beyond environmental media to consumer products.","emerging contaminants, high resolution, liquid chromatography, pharmaceuticals, recycled paper, suspect screening",Journal Of Hazardous Materials,contamin paper product variou chemic report global level date publish research investig pharmaceut contamin product studi pharmaceut analysi conduct sampl collect variou point recycl paper valu chain cape town south africa includ variou grade may includ manufactur recycl paperboard analysi achiev extract paper sampl detect orbitrap quantif limit rang ketoprofen methocarbamol pharmaceut identifi newspap sampl dexamethason ketoprofen latter also detect paper shop bag infant bathtub packag batteri packag egg carton carbamazepin also promin concentr reach veget box suspect screen tent identifi addit pharmaceut paper sampl minocyclin prazepam anabol steroid appear promin pioneer studi indic unintent pharmaceut exposur expand beyond environment medium consum product emerg contamin unintent substanc paper board case unexpect pharmaceut detect paper recycl chain
222,Preparation of imidazolium ionic liquid functionalized paper membrane for selective extraction of caffeic acid and its structural and functional analogues from Taraxaci Herba.,"In the search for pharmaceutically active compounds from natural products, it is crucial and challenging to develop separation or purification methods that target not only structurally similar compounds but also those with specific pharmaceutical functions. The adsorption-based method is widely employed in this field and holds potential for this application, given the diverse range of functional monomers that can be chosen based on structural or functional selectivity. In this work, an imidazolium ionic liquid (IL) modified paper membrane was synthesized via microwave reaction. Caffeic acid (CA), with potential interactions with imidazolium IL and a representative component of phenolic acids in Taraxaci Herba, was chosen as a target compound. After optimization of synthesis and extraction parameters, the resulting extraction membrane could be used to quantitatively analyze CA at ng/ml level, and to extract CA's analogues from the sample matrix. Cheminformatics confirmed the presence of structural and functional similarity among these extracted compounds. This study offers a novel approach to preparing a readily synthesized extraction membrane capable of isolating compounds with structural and functional analogies, as well as developing a membrane solid-phase extraction-based analytical method for natural products.","taraxaci herba, caffeic acid, imidazolium ionic liquid, membrane extraction, microwave preparation, similarity of structure and function",Biomedical Chromatography : Bmc,search pharmaceut activ compound natur product crucial challeng develop separ purif method target structur similar compound also specif pharmaceut function method wide employ field hold potenti applic given diver rang function monom chosen base structur function select work imidazolium ionic liquid il modifi paper membran synthes via microwav reaction caffeic acid ca potenti interact imidazolium il repres compon phenol acid taraxaci herba chosen target compound optim synthesi extract paramet result extract membran could use quantit analyz ca level extract ca analogu sampl matrix cheminformat confirm presenc structur function similar among extract compound studi offer novel approach prepar readili synthes extract membran capabl isol compound structur function analog well develop membran analyt method natur product prepar imidazolium ionic liquid function paper membran select extract caffeic acid structur function analogu taraxaci herba
223,Analysing the ethics of breast cancer overdiagnosis: a pathogenic vulnerability.,"Breast cancer screening aims to help women by early identification and treatment of cancers that might otherwise be life-threatening. However, breast cancer screening also leads to the detection of some cancers that, if left undetected and untreated, would not have damaged the health of the women concerned. At the time of diagnosis, harmless cancers cannot be identified as non-threatening, therefore women are offered invasive breast cancer treatment. This phenomenon of identifying (and treating) non-harmful cancers is called overdiagnosis. Overdiagnosis is morally problematic as it leads to overall patient harm rather than benefit. Further, breast cancer screening is offered in a context that exaggerates cancer risk and screening benefit, minimises risk of harm and impedes informed choice. These factors combine to create pathogenic vulnerability. That is, breast cancer screening exacerbates rather than reduces women's vulnerability and undermines women's agency. This paper provides an original way of conceptualising agency-supporting responses to the harms of breast cancer overdiagnosis through application of the concept of pathogenic vulnerability.","breast cancer, ethics, harm, overdiagnosis, pathogenic vulnerability, screening, vulnerability","Medicine, Health Care, And Philosophy",breast cancer screen aim help woman earli identif treatment cancer might otherwis howev breast cancer screen also lead detect cancer left undetect untreat would damag health woman concern time diagnosi harmless cancer identifi therefor woman offer invas breast cancer treatment phenomenon identifi treat cancer call overdiagnosi overdiagnosi moral problemat lead overal patient harm rather benefit breast cancer screen offer context exagger cancer risk screen benefit minimis risk harm imped inform choic factor combin creat pathogen vulner breast cancer screen exacerb rather reduc woman vulner undermin woman agenc paper provid origin way conceptualis respons harm breast cancer overdiagnosi applic concept pathogen vulner analys ethic breast cancer overdiagnosi pathogen vulner

Al features formed on several kinds of paper substrates (calendar, magazine, and inkjet printing paper substrates) are less than ~60 nm thick, and their electrical conductivities were found to be as good as thermally evaporated Al film or even better (≤2 Ω/□). Strong adhesion of Al features to paper substrates and their excellent flexibility are also experimentally confirmed by TEM observation and mechanical tests, such as tape and bending tests. The solution processed Al features on paper substrates show different electrical and mechanical performance depending on the paper type, and inkjet printing paper is found to be the best substrate with high and stable electrical and mechanical properties.

225,Application of acid-modified Imperata cylindrica powder for latent fingerprint development.,"A novel powdering material that utilizes acid-modified Imperata cylindrica (IC) powder for the development of fingermarks was studied. Experiments were carried out to determine the suitability, adherence quality and sensitivity of the acid-modified IC powder. Fingermarks of different constituents (eccrine, sebaceous and natural fingermarks) on different types of surfaces were used. Acid-modified IC powder was also used to develop fingermarks of different ages as well as aged fingermarks recovered from the water. From the visual inspection, acid-modified IC powder was able to interact with different fingermark constituents and produced distinct ridge details on the examined surfaces. It was also able to develop aged fingermarks and fingermarks that were submerged in water. A statistical comparison was made against the Sirchie® Hi-Fi black powder in terms of the powders' sensitivity and quality of the developed natural fingermarks. The image quality was analyzed using MITRE's Image Quality of Fingerprint (IQF) software. From the experiments, acid-modified IC powder has the potential as a fingermark development powder, although natural fingermarks developed by Sirchie® black powder showed better quality and sensitivity based on the results of the statistical comparison.","forensic science, imperata cylindrica, latent fingerprint, latent fingerprint powder, powdering material",Science & Justice : Journal Of The Forensic Science Society,novel powder materi util imperata cylindrica ic powder develop fingermark studi experi carri determin suitabl adher qualiti sensit ic powder fingermark differ constitu eccrin sebac natur fingermark differ type surfac use ic powder also use develop fingermark differ age well age fingermark recov water visual inspect ic powder abl interact differ fingermark constitu produc distinct ridg detail examin surfac also abl develop age fingermark fingermark submerg water statist comparison made black powder term powder sensit qualiti develop natur fingermark imag qualiti analyz use mitr imag qualiti fingerprint iqf softwar experi ic powder potenti fingermark develop powder although natur fingermark develop black powder show better qualiti sensit base result statist comparison applic imperata cylindrica powder latent fingerprint develop
226,"'Look mommy, I'm eating the plate model!' Biopedagogies and coping with obesity through objectification.","Childhood obesity is increasing in many parts of the world. For the child, obesity often involves major social challenges. Within the framework of social studies of children and childhood and employing the concept of biopedagogies, I explore how children with severe obesity who participate in a long-term rehabilitation programme changed the perception of their bodies from 'being fat' to 'suffering from obesity' by embracing the biopedagogies involved. Due to this transformation, 'obesity' was made into an entity - 'a thing' that the children could work on -, which was used for coping and change. The article is based on an ethnographic field study of a Norwegian randomized medical intervention trial for children with obesity.

227,Disconnectedness from the here-and-now: a phenomenological perspective as a counteract on the medicalisation of death wishes in elderly people.,"When elderly people are ideating on manners to end their lives, because they feel life is over and no longer worth living, it is important to understand their lived experiences, thoughts and behaviour in order to appropriately align care, support and policy to the needs of these people. In the literature, the wish to die in elderly people is often understood from a medical, psychopathological paradigm, referred to as cognitive impairment, depressive disorder, pathological bereavement, and suicidality. In this paper, we evaluate this dominant paradigm by considering three serious limitations, namely: (1) the risk of epistemic transformation; (2) the risk of reduction; and (3) the risk of obscuring the social and cultural embeddedness. Drawing on insights from our empirical-phenomenological research on the issue of elderly and the self-chosen death, this paper argues for a phenomenological perspective to counteract the medicalisation of death wishes in elderly people.","elderly people, human science phenomenology, humanisation of policy, medicalization of death and death wishes, phenomenology, proto-ethics, wish to die","Medicine, Health Care, And Philosophy",elderli peopl ideat manner end live feel life longer worth live import understand live experi thought behaviour order appropri align care support polici need peopl literatur wish die elderli peopl often understood medic psychopatholog paradigm refer cognit impair depress disord patholog bereav suicid paper evalu domin paradigm consid three seriou limit name risk epistem transform risk reduct risk obscur social cultur embedded draw insight research issu elderli death paper argu phenomenolog perspect counteract medicalis death wish elderli peopl disconnected phenomenolog perspect counteract medicalis death wish elderli peopl
228,Finger Pricks and Blood Vials: How doctors medicalize 'cultural' solutions to demedicalize the 'broken' hymen in the Netherlands.,"This paper provides new perspectives on the scholarship on medicalization and demedicalization, building on an ethnography of hymenoplasty consultations in the Netherlands. By examining how doctors can play an active role in demedicalization, this paper presents novel insights into Dutch physicians' attempt to demedicalize the ""broken"" hymen. In their consultations, Dutch doctors persuade hymenoplasty patients to abandon the assumed medical definition of the ""broken"" hymen and offer nonmedical solutions to patients' problems. Drawing from unique ethnographical access from 2012 to 2015 to 70 hymenoplasty consultations in the Netherlands, this paper's original contribution comes from closely examining how demedicalization can be achieved through the process of medicalization. It investigates how Dutch physicians go even further in their efforts to demedicalize by medicalizing ""cultural"" solutions as an alternative course of action to surgery.","demedicalization, hymenoplasty, hymenorrhaphy, medical anthropology, medicalization, sexuality, surgery, the netherlands",Social Science & Medicine (1982),paper provid new perspect scholarship medic demedic build ethnographi hymenoplasti consult netherland examin doctor play activ role demedic paper present novel insight dutch physician attempt demedic broken hymen consult dutch doctor persuad hymenoplasti patient abandon assum medic definit broken hymen offer nonmed solut patient problem draw uniqu ethnograph access hymenoplasti consult netherland paper origin contribut come close examin demedic achiev process medic investig dutch physician go even effort demedic medic cultur solut altern cours action surgeri finger prick blood vial doctor medic solut demedic hymen netherland
229,DNA Tetrahedra-Cross-linked Hydrogel Functionalized Paper for Onsite Analysis of DNA Methyltransferase Activity Using a Personal Glucose Meter.,"Despite the recent developments on the construction of point-of-care testing (POCT) devices, it is still a big challenge to build portable POCT tools for simple, sensitive, selective, and quantitative determination of disease-related biomarkers. With this in mind, we developed a simple and user-friendly POCT tool for onsite analysis of DNA adenine methyltransferase (Dam) activity by using DNA tetrahedra-based hydrogel to trap glucose-producing enzymes for target recognition and signal transduction. The enzyme-encapsulated DNA hydrogel and the substrate of enzyme were separately modified on papers and then combined onto a commercial glucose test strip for the sensitive evaluation of Dam activity via using a personal glucose meter (PGM) for quantitative signal readout. Taking advantage of the great amount of enzyme entrapped in DNA hydrogel and the high signal amplification ability of enzyme, this POCT tool is capable of highly sensitive and selective determination of Dam activity with a direct detection limit down to 0.001 U/mL, which is superior to that of most previously reported biosensors. Furthermore, this device can also be applied to screen inhibitor and analyze Dam activity in spiked serum samples, indicating the great potential for clinical practice and diagnostic applications. Additionally, all the reactions for Dam assay are performed on paper, which is simple and deliverable to end-users for medical diagnostics at home or in-field.",no keywords,Analytical Chemistry,despit recent develop construct test poct devic still big challeng build portabl poct tool simpl sensit select quantit determin biomark mind develop simpl poct tool onsit analysi dna adenin methyltransferas dam activ use dna hydrogel trap enzym target recognit signal transduct dna hydrogel substrat enzym separ modifi paper combin onto commerci glucos test strip sensit evalu dam activ via use person glucos meter pgm quantit signal readout take advantag great amount enzym entrap dna hydrogel high signal amplif abil enzym poct tool capabl highli sensit select determin dam activ direct detect limit superior previous report biosensor furthermor devic also appli screen inhibitor analyz dam activ spike serum sampl indic great potenti clinic practic diagnost applic addit reaction dam assay perform paper simpl deliver medic diagnost home dna hydrogel function paper onsit analysi dna methyltransferas activ use person glucos meter

Eosin Y is used as an assay label to photo-initiate free-radical polymerization to produce colored hydrogels in the presence of target analytes captured by bioactive paper. PBA achieves high-contrast and time-independent signals, but its nanomolar detection limit makes it impractical for early diagnosis of many diseases. In this work, we demonstrated efficient localization of large quantities of eosin Y per captured target analyte by incorporating eosin Y-loaded liposomes into PBA. This new ""materials approach"" allowed 30-fold signal enhancement compared to conventional PBA. To further improve the detection limit of liposome-enhanced PBA, we used a continuous flow-through assay format with 100 μL of analyte solution, achieving sub-nanomolar detection limits with high-contrast signals that were easily discernible to the unaided eye.","colorimetric detection, dye-encapsulating liposome, paper-based diagnostic test, photo-initiated polymerization, signal amplification",Acs Applied Materials & Interfaces,signal amplif pba approach improv sensit diagnost test eosin use assay label polymer produc color hydrogel presenc target analyt captur bioactiv paper pba achiev signal nanomolar detect limit make impract earli diagnosi mani diseas work demonstr effici local larg quantiti eosin per captur target analyt incorpor eosin liposom pba new materi approach allow signal enhanc compar convent pba improv detect limit pba use continu assay format μl analyt solut achiev detect limit signal easili discern unaid eye signal amplif highli sensit biodetect sensor

Furthermore, the CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> selectivity of aerogels decreased with decreasing specific surface area, which was mainly caused by the decrease in CO<sub>2</sub> capture. In addition, the CO<sub>2</sub> sorption capacity of the sample with 2% cellulose content, CA-2, exceeded the values reported so far for many other sorbents with higher specific surface areas, and showed reasonable cyclic stability for CO<sub>2</sub> capture. Therefore, this adsorbent represents an attractive prospect for CO<sub>2</sub> uptake at room temperature.","co(2) uptake, cellulose aerogels, old corrugated containers, physisorption, room temperature and pressure",Carbohydrate Polymers,old corrug contain low recycl use raw materi synthes seri aerogel vari cellulos concentr solut via process result aerogel rich porou structur specif surfac area rang sup sup mesopor volum rang cm sup sup test co sub sorption ambient temperatur pressur display excel co sub adsorpt capac rang sup furthermor co sub sub select aerogel decreas decreas specif surfac area mainli caus decreas co sub captur addit co sub sorption capac sampl cellulos content exceed valu report far mani sorbent higher specif surfac area show reason cyclic stabil co sub captur therefor adsorb repres attract prospect co sub uptak room temperatur co sub captur perform character cellulos aerogel synthes old corrug contain

Herein, we introduce an agarose hydrogel conditioning method to enhance the performance of paper spray ionization mass spectrometry. With facile and fast hydrogel conditioning, the signal intensity of therapeutic drugs spiked in urine was 5 to 15 fold higher than that in direct paper spray ionization mass spectrometry analysis. Consequently, the sensitivity of metabolites in urine was improved via hydrogel conditioning, resulting in 9 to 15 fold decrease in the possibility of detection (POD) levels. These results show that agarose hydrogel conditioning coupled with paper spray ionization mass spectrometry could serve as a facile ionization method for ambient mass spectrometry, which might be useful in fast screening of metabolites and therapeutic drugs in raw biofluids.",no keywords,The Analyst,rapid analysi metabolit biofluid great import diseas diagnosi diseas screen herein introduc agaros hydrogel condit method enhanc perform paper spray ioniz mass spectrometri facil fast hydrogel condit signal intens therapeut drug spike urin fold higher direct paper spray ioniz mass spectrometri analysi consequ sensit metabolit urin improv via hydrogel condit result fold decreas possibl detect pod level result show agaros hydrogel condit coupl paper spray ioniz mass spectrometri could serv facil ioniz method ambient mass spectrometri might use fast screen metabolit therapeut drug raw biofluid agaros paper spray ioniz mass spectrometri metabolit detect raw urin
235,A tutorial translation of the description of the historically first polymer drug conjugate and its in vivo evaluation.,"Preamble Polymer-drug conjugates have been intensively investigated for several decades, and even though their clinical success still lags behind the promise many researchers have placed in them, they are a mainstay in the fields of polymer therapeutics or nanomedicine. For many in the field, the seminal perspective paper by Helmut Ringsdorf from 1975 marks the beginning of this field of research. With more than one thousand citations, this paper has indubitably affected and inspired generations of researchers in the field, including the author of this translation. However, it is not the first paper describing the concept of polymer-drug conjugates. Some twenty years earlier, Horst Jatzkewitz described in two outstanding articles probably the historically first polymer-drug conjugates, detailed its synthesis, characterization and even first in vivo experiments. The results, carefully re-interpreted through the eyes of a scientist of the 21st century, clearly highlight several issues that need to be taken into consideration when designing polymer-drug conjugates. However, despite the pioneering nature of this paper, it is all but forgotten by the scientific community. In the author's opinion, Horst Jatzkewitz and these papers clearly did not receive the attention and praise they deserve. Whether this was because these paper were much ahead of it´s time, or because it was published in German language, or for some other reason, we cannot know. However, these papers are, in my opinion, an excellent piece of work that should be known more widely and available to students and experts world-wide, which is why the author decided to translate it. Also, to give some more context and to help understand some outdated terms or concepts, additional comments and explanations are added throughout.

236,Microfluidic paper-based analytical device for particulate metals.,"A microfluidic paper-based analytical device (μPAD) fabricated by wax printing was designed to assess occupational exposure to metal-containing aerosols. This method employs rapid digestion of particulate metals using microliters of acid added directly to a punch taken from an air sampling filter. Punches were then placed on a μPAD, and digested metals were transported to detection reservoirs upon addition of water. These reservoirs contained reagents for colorimetric detection of Fe, Cu, and Ni. Dried buffer components were used to set the optimal pH in each detection reservoir, while precomplexation agents were deposited in the channels between the sample and detection zones to minimize interferences from competing metals. Metal concentrations were quantified from color intensity images using a scanner in conjunction with image processing software. Reproducible, log-linear calibration curves were generated for each metal, with method detection limits ranging from 1.0 to 1.5 μg for each metal (i.e., total mass present on the μPAD). Finally, a standard incineration ash sample was aerosolized, collected on filters, and analyzed for the three metals of interest. Analysis of this collected aerosol sample using a μPAD showed good correlation with known amounts of the metals present in the sample. This technology can provide rapid assessment of particulate metal concentrations at or below current regulatory limits and at dramatically reduced cost.",no keywords,Analytical Chemistry,microfluid analyt devic μpad fabric wax print design assess occup exposur aerosol method employ rapid digest particul metal use microlit acid ad directli punch taken air sampl filter punch place μpad digest metal transport detect reservoir upon addit water reservoir contain reagent colorimetr detect fe cu ni dri buffer compon use set optim ph detect reservoir precomplex agent deposit channel sampl detect zone minim interfer compet metal metal concentr quantifi color intens imag use scanner conjunct imag process softwar reproduc calibr curv gener metal method detect limit rang μg metal total mass present μpad final standard inciner ash sampl aerosol collect filter analyz three metal interest analysi collect aerosol sampl use μpad show good correl known amount metal present sampl technolog provid rapid assess particul metal concentr current regulatori limit dramat reduc cost microfluid analyt devic particul metal
237,Lateral Flow Assay Based on Paper-Hydrogel Hybrid Material for Sensitive Point-of-Care Detection of Dengue Virus.,"Paper-based devices have been broadly used for the point-of-care detection of dengue viral nucleic acids due to their simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and readily observable colorimetric readout. However, their moderate sensitivity and functionality have limited their applications. Despite the above-mentioned advantages, paper substrates are lacking in their ability to control fluid flow, in contrast to the flow control enabled by polymer substrates (e.g., agarose) with readily tunable pore size and porosity. Herein, taking the benefits from both materials, the authors propose a strategy to create a hybrid substrate by incorporating agarose into the test strip to achieve flow control for optimal biomolecule interactions. As compared to the unmodified test strip, this strategy allows sensitive detection of targets with an approximately tenfold signal improvement. Additionally, the authors showcase the potential of functionality improvement by creating multiple test zones for semi-quantification of targets, suggesting that the number of visible test zones is directly proportional to the target concentration. The authors further demonstrate the potential of their proposed strategy for clinical assessment by applying it to their prototype sample-to-result test strip to sensitively and semi-quantitatively detect dengue viral RNA from the clinical blood samples. This proposed strategy holds significant promise for detecting various targets for diverse future applications.","agarose, dengue viral detection, semi-quantification, sensitivity enhancement, test strips",Advanced Healthcare Materials,devic broadli use detect dengu viral nucleic acid due simplic readili observ colorimetr readout howev moder sensit function limit applic despit advantag paper substrat lack abil control fluid flow contrast flow control enabl polym substrat agaros readili tunabl pore size poros herein take benefit materi author propos strategi creat hybrid substrat incorpor agaros test strip achiev flow control optim biomolecul interact compar unmodifi test strip strategi allow sensit detect target approxim tenfold signal improv addit author showcas potenti function improv creat multipl test zone target suggest number visibl test zone directli proport target concentr author demonstr potenti propos strategi clinic assess appli prototyp test strip sensit detect dengu viral rna clinic blood sampl propos strategi hold signific promis detect variou target diver futur applic later flow assay base hybrid materi sensit detect dengu viru
238,"Lower-dose prescribing: minimizing ""side effects"" of pharmaceuticals on society and the environment.","The prescribed use of pharmaceuticals can result in unintended, unwelcomed, and potentially adverse consequences for the environment and for those not initially targeted for treatment. Medication usage frequently results in the collateral introduction to the environment (via excretion and bathing) of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), bioactive metabolites, and reversible conjugates. Imprudent prescribing and non-compliant patient behavior drive the accumulation of unused medications, which pose major public health risks from diversion as well as risks for the environment from unsound disposal, such as flushing to sewers. The prescriber has the unique wherewithal to reduce each of these risks by modifying various aspects of the practice of prescribing. By incorporating consideration of the potential for adverse environmental impacts into the practice of prescribing, patient care also could possibly be improved and public health better protected. Although excretion of an API is governed by its characteristic pharmacokinetics, this variable can be somewhat controlled by the prescriber in selecting APIs possessing environment-friendly excretion profiles and in selecting the lowest effective dose. This paper presents the first critical examination of the multi-faceted role of drug dose in reducing the ambient levels of APIs in the environment and in reducing the incidence of drug wastage, which ultimately necessitates disposal of leftovers. Historically, drug dose has been actively excluded from consideration in risk mitigation strategies for reducing ambient API levels in the environment. Personalized adjustment of drug dose also holds the potential for enhancing therapeutic outcomes while simultaneously reducing the incidence of adverse drug events and in lowering patient healthcare costs. Optimizing drug dose is a major factor in improving the sustainability of health care. The prescriber needs to be cognizant that the ""patient"" encompasses the environment and other ""bystanders,"" and that prescribed treatments can have unanticipated, collateral impacts that reach far beyond the healthcare setting.",no keywords,The Science Of The Total Environment,prescrib use pharmaceut result unintend unwelcom potenti advers consequ environ initi target treatment medic usag frequent result collater introduct environ via excret bath activ pharmaceut ingredi api bioactiv metabolit revers conjug imprud prescrib patient behavior drive accumul unus medic pose major public health risk diver well risk environ unsound dispos flush sewer prescrib uniqu wherewith reduc risk modifi variou aspect practic prescrib incorpor consider potenti advers environment impact practic prescrib patient care also could possibl improv public health better protect although excret api govern characterist pharmacokinet variabl somewhat control prescrib select api possess excret profil select lowest effect dose paper present first critic examin role drug dose reduc ambient level api environ reduc incid drug wastag ultim necessit dispos leftov histor drug dose activ exclud consider risk mitig strategi reduc ambient api level environ person adjust drug dose also hold potenti enhanc therapeut outcom simultan reduc incid advers drug event lower patient healthcar cost optim drug dose major factor improv sustain health care prescrib need cogniz patient encompass environ bystand prescrib treatment unanticip collater impact reach far beyond healthcar set prescrib minim side effect pharmaceut societi environ
239,Quantitative analysis of finasteride tablets dissolution content with non-isotopically labeled internal standard by paper spray ionization mass spectrometry.,"Paper spray ionization, one of the ambient mass spectrometry technologies, has been developed to characterize the content of drugs in various complex matrixes including urine, whole blood, dissolution solutions, and so on. An isotopically labeled compound as internal standard is often used in quantitative paper spray ionization experiments. But high cost and difficult to access impede the application of this type of internal standards. Application of non-isotopically labeled compounds as internal standards will make this technology more prevalent. In this paper, we explored the application of finasteride impurity as the internal standard in paper spray ionization-mass spectrometry to measure the dissolution content of finasteride tablets. The new method was optimized and the results were compared to those from high-performance liquid chromatography. The whole analysis time was several minutes and limit of detection for finasteride was around 4.8 ng/mL. The results from paper spray ionization-mass spectrometry were similar to those from high-performance liquid chromatography. Combination of paper spray ionization-mass spectrometry and non-isotopically labeled internal standard renders a new method to analyze drug dissolution content with high specificity, low limit of detection, and simple sample preparation within short time period.","dissolution content, internal standards, paper spray ionization",Journal Of Separation Science,paper spray ioniz one ambient mass spectrometri technolog develop character content drug variou complex matrix includ urin whole blood dissolut solut isotop label compound intern standard often use quantit paper spray ioniz experi high cost difficult access imped applic type intern standard applic label compound intern standard make technolog preval paper explor applic finasterid impur intern standard paper spray spectrometri measur dissolut content finasterid tablet new method optim result compar liquid chromatographi whole analysi time sever minut limit detect finasterid around result paper spray spectrometri similar liquid chromatographi combin paper spray spectrometri label intern standard render new method analyz drug dissolut content high specif low limit detect simpl sampl prepar within short time period quantit analysi finasterid tablet dissolut content label intern standard paper spray ioniz mass spectrometri
240,"'Sometimes, it's easier to write the prescription': physician and patient accounts of the reluctant medicalisation of sleeplessness.","The medicalisation of sleep is a rich and growing area of sociological interest. Previous research suggests that medicalisation is occurring within the context of physician office visits, but the inner workings remain unclear. This study is the first to provide perspectives on the office visit interaction from both sleepless patients (n = 27) and the physicians (n = 8) who treat them. Analyses of semi-structured qualitative interviews reveal that sleep-related conversations are typically patient-initiated in routine office visits. Physicians and patients conceptualised insomnia as a symptom of another issue (depression), an everyday problem of living (stress) or the result of a natural life process (aging). Lack of sleep was not necessarily linked to daytime impairment. Even though sleep aids were routinely requested and prescribed, patients and physicians consistently expressed attitudes of reluctance toward the use of sedative hypnotics. I call this a case of 'reluctant medicalisation' and highlight the liminal space between pathology and normalcy inhabited by patients and physicians. I also build on recent work acknowledging the dynamics between macro and micro levels of medicalisation and illustrate the influence of multilevel 'engines' (consumerism, biotechnology, managed care and physicians) in patients' and physicians' accounts.

241,Hormone treatment of children and adolescents with gender dysphoria: an ethical analysis.,"In the context of transgender health, most people are not comfortable with allowing a twelve-year-old child with gender dysphoria to elect to undergo gender reassignment surgery. The likelihood is too high that the child would be unable to fully comprehend the scope of a decision that carries significant, permanent consequences, particularly because the decision to surgically change gender is based upon a conception of gender that can fluctuate during adolescent years. Conversely, however, most people would not contend that this fluidity is reason to wholly deny certain medical care such as hormonal treatments to transgender youth, a demographic with extremely high rates of violent behavior, self-harm, and suicide. This paper will explore ethical considerations to this emerging debate of what therapeutic options should be offered to transgender children and adolescents. Pediatric endocrinologists have been treating gender dysphoric adolescents with puberty-suppressing drugs and, to a lesser extent, with cross-sex hormone therapies for more than twenty years. Clinicians and thought leaders have mentioned ethical components of this emerging practice in the few cohort studies and clinical review articles about the subject. However, ethics have generally been a secondary consideration in the medical academic literature. In this paper, I will provide a brief overview of the practice, summarize the current research on hormone treatment for transgender minors, and provide an ethical analysis of the practice.",no keywords,The Hastings Center Report,context transgend health peopl comfort allow child gender dysphoria elect undergo gender reassign surgeri likelihood high child would unabl fulli comprehend scope decis carri signific perman consequ particularli decis surgic chang gender base upon concept gender fluctuat adolesc year convers howev peopl would contend fluiditi reason wholli deni certain medic care hormon treatment transgend youth demograph extrem high rate violent behavior suicid paper explor ethic consider emerg debat therapeut option offer transgend child adolesc pediatr endocrinologist treat gender dysphor adolesc drug lesser extent hormon therapi twenti year clinician thought leader mention ethic compon emerg practic cohort studi clinic review articl subject howev ethic gener secondari consider medic academ literatur paper provid brief overview practic summar current research hormon treatment transgend minor provid ethic analysi practic hormon treatment child adolesc gender dysphoria ethic analysi

243,Analytical characterization of three hallucinogenic N-(2-methoxy)benzyl derivatives of the 2C-series of phenethylamine drugs.,"This publication reports analytical properties of three new hallucinogenic substances identified in blotter papers seized from the drug market, namely 25D-NBOMe [2-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylphenyl)-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)ethanamine], 25E-NBOMe [2-(4-ethyl-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)ethanamine] and 25G-NBOMe [2-(2,5-dimethoxy-3,4-dimethylphenyl)-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)ethanamine]. These substances are N-(2-methoxy)benzyl derivatives of the 2C-series of phenethylamine drugs. The applied procedure covered a variety of analytical methods, including gas chromatography with electron impact mass spectrometry (GC-EI-MS; without derivatization and after derivatization with trifluoroacetic anhydride (TFAA)), liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-QTOF-MS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which made it possible to identify the active components unequivocally. The GC-MS spectra of analyzed compounds were very similar, with dominant ions observed at m/z = 150, 121, and 91. The remaining ions were analogous to those observed for parent substances, namely 2C-D, 2C-E, 2C-G, but their intensities were low. Derivatization allowed determination of molecular masses of the investigated substances. Their exact masses and chemical formulas were confirmed by LC-QTOF-MS experiments and the fragmentation patterns of these compounds following ESI were determined. The tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) experiments confirmed that the studied substances were N-(2-methoxy)benzyl derivatives of the 2C-series compounds. Final elucidation of the structures was performed by NMR spectroscopy. The substances were also characterized by FTIR spectroscopy to corroborate the identity of the compounds.","nbome, blotter paper, hallucinogens, identification",Drug Testing And Analysis,public report analyt properti three new hallucinogen substanc identifi blotter paper seiz drug market name ethanamin ethanamin ethanamin substanc benzyl deriv phenethylamin drug appli procedur cover varieti analyt method includ ga chromatographi electron impact mass spectrometri without derivat derivat trifluoroacet anhydrid tfaa liquid time flight mass spectrometri fourier transform infrar spectroscopi ftir nuclear magnet reson nmr made possibl identifi activ compon unequivoc spectrum analyz compound similar domin ion observ remain ion analog observ parent substanc name intens low derivat allow determin molecular mass investig substanc exact mass chemic formula confirm experi fragment pattern compound follow esi determin tandem mass spectrometri experi confirm studi substanc benzyl deriv compound final elucid structur perform nmr spectroscopi substanc also character ftir spectroscopi corrobor ident compound analyt character three hallucinogen benzyl deriv phenethylamin drug
244,Sustainable Stability-Indicating spectra manipulations for the concurrent quantification of a novel Anti-COVID-19 drug and its active Metabolite: Green profile assessment.,"Millions of individuals have lost their lives and changed their routines as a direct consequence of exposure to the coronavirus (Covid-19). Molnupiravir (MOL) is an orally bioavailable tiny molecule antiviral prodrug that is effective for curing the coronavirus that produces serious acute respiratory disorder (SARS-CoV-2). Fully green-assessed stability-indicating simple spectrophotometric methods have been developed and fully validated as per ICH criteria. The potential impact of degradation products of drug components on the safety and efficacy of a medication's shelf life is likely to be negligible. The field of pharmaceutical analysis necessitates various stability testing under different conditions. The conduct of such inquiries affords the prospect of predicting the most probable routes of degradation and ascertaining the inherent stability characteristics of the active drugs. Consequently, a surge in demand arose for the creation of an analytical methodology that could consistently measure the degradation products and/or impurities that may be present in pharmaceuticals. Herein, five smart and simple spectrophotometric data manipulation techniques have been produced for the concurrent estimation of MOL and its active metabolite as its possible acid degradation product namely; N-hydroxycytidine (NHC). Structure confirmation of NHC build-up through IR, MS and NMR analyses. All current techniques verified linearity ranging from 10 to 150 μg/ml and 10-60 μg/ml for MOL and NHC, respectively. The limit of quantitation (LOQ) values were in the range of 4.21-9.59 μg/ml, while the limit of detection (LOD) values were ranging from 1.38 - 3.16 μg/ml. The current methods were evaluated in terms of greenness by four assessing methods and confirmed to be green. The significant novelty of these methods depends on their being the first environmentally soundness stability-indicating spectrophotometric approaches for the concurrent estimation of MOL and its active metabolite, NHC. Also, the preparation of purified NHC delivers significant cost savings, instead of purchasing an expensive ingredient. These smart methods were utilized for analyzing the pharmaceutical dosage form which may be of great benefit to the pharmaceutical market.","coronavirus, green, molnupiravir, n-hydroxycytidine, stability-indicating, uv- spectrophotometry","Spectrochimica Acta.

246,Bridging papermaking and hydrogel production: Nanoparticle-loaded cellulosic hollow fibers with pitted walls as skeleton materials for multifunctional electromagnetic hydrogels.,"Electromagnetic hydrogels have attracted significant attention due to their vast potential in soft robotics, biomedical engineering, and energy harvesting. To facilitate future commercialization via large-scale industrial processes, we present a facile concept that utilizes the specialized knowledge of papermaking to fabricate hydrogels with multifunctional electromagnetic properties. The principles of papermaking wet end chemistry, which involves the handling of interactions among cellulosic fibers, fines, polymeric additives, and other components in aqueous systems, serves as a key foundation for this concept. Notably, based on these principles, the versatile use of chemical additives in combination with cellulosic materials enables the tailored design of various products. Our methodology exploits the unique hierarchically pitted and hollow tube-like structures of papermaking grade cellulosic fibers with discernible pits, enabling the incorporation of magnetite nanoparticles through lumen loading. By combining microscale softwood-derived cellulosic fibers with additives, we achieve dynamic covalent interactions that transform the cellulosic fiber slurry into an impressive hydrogel. The cellulosic fibers act as a skeleton, providing structural support within the hydrogel framework and facilitating the dispersion of nanoparticles. In accordance with our concept, the typical hydrogel exhibits combined attributes, including electrical conductivity, self-healing properties, pH responsiveness, and dynamic rheologic behavior. Our approach not only yields hydrogels with interesting properties but also aligns with the forefront of advanced cellulosic material applications. These materials hold the promise in remote strain sensing devices, electromagnetic navigation systems, contactless toys, and flexible electronic devices. The concept and findings of the current work may shed light on materials innovation based on traditional pulp and paper processes. Furthermore, the facile processes involved in hydrogel formation can serve as valuable tools for chemistry and materials education, providing easy demonstrations of principles for university students at different levels.","cellulosic materials, electromagnetic hydrogels, hierarchically pitted structures, lumen loading, papermaking fibers, papermaking-inspired materials science, pulp and paper processes, wet end chemistry & chemical additives",International Journal Of Biological Macromolecules,electromagnet hydrogel attract signific attent due vast potenti soft robot biomed engin energi harvest facilit futur commerci via industri process present facil concept util special knowledg papermak fabric hydrogel multifunct electromagnet properti principl papermak wet end chemistri involv handl interact among cellulos fiber fine polymer addit compon aqueou system serv key foundat concept notabl base principl versatil use chemic addit combin cellulos materi enabl tailor design variou product methodolog exploit uniqu hierarch pit hollow structur papermak grade cellulos fiber discern pit enabl incorpor magnetit nanoparticl lumen load combin microscal cellulos fiber addit achiev dynam coval interact transform cellulos fiber slurri impress hydrogel cellulos fiber act skeleton provid structur support within hydrogel framework facilit dispers nanoparticl accord concept typic hydrogel exhibit combin attribut includ electr conduct properti ph respons dynam rheolog behavior approach yield hydrogel interest properti also align forefront advanc cellulos materi applic materi hold promis remot strain sen devic electromagnet navig system contactless toy flexibl electron devic concept find current work may shed light materi innov base tradit pulp paper process furthermor facil process involv hydrogel format serv valuabl tool chemistri materi educ provid easi demonstr principl univers student differ level bridg papermak hydrogel product cellulos hollow fiber pit wall skeleton materi multifunct electromagnet hydrogel
247,Double-Color Lanthanide Metal-Organic Framework Based Logic Device and Visual Ratiometric Fluorescence Water Microsensor for Solid Pharmaceuticals.,"Water is one of the most widespread impurities and contaminants for pharmaceuticals and chemical products. A simple, fast and reliable water assay method is of high significance for the pharmaceutical and chemical manufacturing industries. In this work, lanthanide metal-organic framework Eu-dipicolinic acid/2-aminophthalic acid (Eu-DPA/PTA-NH<sub>2</sub>) was prepared as a double-color ratiometric fluorescent water sensor, which shows ultrasensitive (limit of detection 0.01% v/v) and linear broad-range (0-100% v/v) response to water. An innovative analytical device based on a one-to-two logic gate was constructed by using the water content and the two fluorescence responses as the input and output signals, respectively. The direct analysis of water content can be achieved by the four output types, NOT (0, 1), PASS 0 (0, 0), PASS 1 (1, 1), and YES (1, 0). Importantly, the metal-organic framework (MOF)-loaded fiber paper was prepared as a microsensor, and a water assay tube was designed for rapid water detection of solid pharmaceuticals via ratiometric chromaticity, coupled with a portable visual determination device. The paper-based microsensor is response-rapid (20 s), long-term stable (at least 30 days), and can achieve the accurate (relative error <9.8%) visual assay of trace water in solid pharmaceuticals. To our knowledge, this is the first time to report an MOF-based double-color ratiometric fluorescent water sensor, a water analytical logic device, and a paper-based water microsensor for point-of-care visual water assay in solid samples via ratiometric chromaticity.",no keywords,Analytical Chemistry,water one widespread impur contamin pharmaceut chemic product simpl fast reliabl water assay method high signific pharmaceut chemic manufactur industri work lanthanid framework acid sub prepar ratiometr fluoresc water sensor show ultrasensit limit detect linear respons water innov analyt devic base logic gate construct use water content two fluoresc respons input output signal respect direct analysi water content achiev four output type pas pas ye importantli framework mof fiber paper prepar microsensor water assay tube design rapid water detect solid pharmaceut via ratiometr chromat coupl portabl visual determin devic microsensor stabl least day achiev accur rel error visual assay trace water solid pharmaceut knowledg first time report ratiometr fluoresc water sensor water analyt logic devic water microsensor visual water assay solid sampl via ratiometr chromat lanthanid framework base logic devic visual ratiometr fluoresc water microsensor solid pharmaceut
248,An examination of the medicalization trend in female genital cutting in Egypt: How does it relate to a girl's risk of being cut?,"Female Genital Cutting (FGC) is increasingly being performed by trained health professionals. International, national, and local institutions strongly oppose this medicalization trend, arguing that the involvement of health-care providers in the performance of FGC will counteract efforts to eliminate the practice. However, no empirical research to date has confirmed or refuted this claim. Therefore, it remains unclear how the medicalization of FGC relates to changes in the prevalence of the practice. In the current paper, we aim to fill this gap in the literature by examining the association between this medicalization trend and the risk of FGC. We focus on Egypt because of its high medicalization and prevalence rates and its unique history of FGC legislation. We performed a discrete-time event-history regression analysis combined with governorate fixed effects using the Egyptian Demographic Health Surveys from 2005, 2008, and 2014 (N = 49,273 daughters clustered within 29,810 mothers). Our results show that increasing medicalization rates coexist with decreasing prevalence rates. This effect is particularly pronounced in a context where a substantial number of cuts were medicalized (estimated at 40% and above). This effect is significantly more pronounced in higher educated mothers. Our study thus shows that the medicalization of FGC can coincide with decreasing prevalence rates of FGC. Medicalization of FGC may take place in a context where an awareness of the health hazards related to FGC is more pronounced, thereby also discouraging the practice as a whole. In addition, the medicalization of FGC may make the practice more individualized and therefore reduce the incentives for FGC.","egypt, female circumcision, female genital cutting, female genital mutilation/cutting, harm reduction, health stratification, medicalization, social norm, status symbol",Social Science & Medicine (1982),femal genit cut fgc increasingli perform train health profession intern nation local institut strongli oppos medic trend argu involv provid perform fgc counteract effort elimin practic howev empir research date confirm refut claim therefor remain unclear medic fgc relat chang preval practic current paper aim fill gap literatur examin associ medic trend risk fgc focu egypt high medic preval rate uniqu histori fgc legisl perform regress analysi combin governor fix effect use egyptian demograph health survey n daughter cluster within mother result show increas medic rate coexist decreas preval rate effect particularli pronounc context substanti number cut medic estim effect significantli pronounc higher educ mother studi thu show medic fgc coincid decreas preval rate fgc medic fgc may take place context awar health hazard relat fgc pronounc therebi also discourag practic whole addit medic fgc may make practic individu therefor reduc incent fgc examin medic trend femal genit cut egypt relat girl risk cut
249,Detection of doxycycline hyclate and oxymetazoline hydrochloride in pharmaceutical preparations via spectrophotometry and microfluidic paper-based analytical device (μPADs).,"There is growing demand for simple to operate, sensitive, on-site quantitative assays to investigate concentrations of drug molecules in pharmaceutical preparations for quality assurance. Here, we report on the development of two colorimetric analysis methods for the study the antibiotic doxycycline hyclate (DOX) and the nasal decongestant oxymetazoline hydrochloride (OXY), in solution as well as in their respective formulations. We compare a UV/vis spectrophotometry method with a color change recorded on a microfluidic paper-based analytical device (μPAD). Detection is based on the pharmaceutical compounds coupling with diazotized 4-aminoacetophenone (DAAP) under alkaline conditions to produce colored azo-dye products. These azo-compounds were monitored by absorbance at 425 nm for DOX and 521 nm for OXY, with linear calibration graphs in the concentration range of 0.5-35 mg L<sup>-1</sup> (DOX) and 1.0-40 mg L<sup>-1</sup> (OXY) and limits of detection of 0.24 mg L<sup>-1</sup> (DOX) and 0.32 mg L<sup>-1</sup> (OXY). For the μPAD method, color intensity was measured from photographs and a linear increase was observed at concentrations from above approximately 15 mg L<sup>-1</sup> for both compounds and up to 35 mg L<sup>-1</sup> for DOX and 40 mg L<sup>-1</sup> for OXY. The developed methods were also applied to the formulated pharmaceuticals and no interference was found from the excipient. Thus, the paper-based device provides an inexpensive, simple alternative approach for use outside centralized laboratories with semi-quantitative capability.","doxycycline hyclate, microfluidic paper-based analytical device (μpads), oxymetazoline hydrochloride, pharmaceutical formulations, spectrophotometry",Analytica Chimica Acta,grow demand simpl oper sensit quantit assay investig concentr drug molecul pharmaceut prepar qualiti assur report develop two colorimetr analysi method studi antibiot doxycyclin hyclat dox nasal decongest oxymetazolin hydrochlorid oxi solut well respect formul compar spectrophotometri method color chang record microfluid analyt devic μpad detect base pharmaceut compound coupl diazot daap alkalin condit produc color product monitor absorb nm dox nm oxi linear calibr graph concentr rang mg l sup dox mg l sup oxi limit detect mg l sup dox mg l sup oxi μpad method color intens measur photograph linear increas observ concentr approxim mg l sup compound mg l sup dox mg l sup oxi develop method also appli formul pharmaceut interfer found excipi thu devic provid inexpens simpl altern approach use outsid central laboratori capabl detect doxycyclin hyclat oxymetazolin hydrochlorid pharmaceut prepar via spectrophotometri microfluid analyt devic μpad

We unravel in detail how counterions, being either of the organic alkyl ammonium kind (NR<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) or of the earth metal series (Li<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, Cs<sup>+</sup>), need to be chosen to achieve outstanding combinations of stiffness, strength, and toughness, extending to previously unreached territories. We relate structure formation processes in terms of colloidal stabilization to nanostructural details such as porosity and ability for swelling, as well as to interfibrillar interactions in bulk and macroscale mechanical properties. We demonstrate that our understanding also leads to new levels of ductility in bioinspired CNF/polymer nanocomposites at high levels of reinforcements.

251,Influence of ZnO morphology on the capability of portable paper-based electrospray ionization mass spectrometry to determine therapeutic drugs in complex matrices.,"Adsorbents play a significant role in enhancing the analytical sensitivity of target analytes in complex samples by mitigating matrix effects. In our recent report, ZnO stood out among various adsorbents to determine target therapeutic drugs in complex biological matrices when applied for portable paper-based electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PPESI-MS). However, the influence of the morphology of ZnO on the performance of PPESI-MS is elusive. Herein, different morphologies of ZnO particles were prepared via co-precipitation or ultrasonic methods, and their capability to determine different therapeutic drugs in serum were systemically investigated. The results demonstrated that flower-shaped ZnO gave a superior capacity, and its analysis sensitivity was 2.9-12.8-fold higher than those achieved with other ZnO morphologies. Further characterization revealed that the unique performance of flower-shaped ZnO was closely associated with its favorable desorption behavior to drugs, small spray plume, and few spray emitters at the tip of coated paper substrate. To illustrate the potential of flower-shaped ZnO, its coated paper was used as a substrate for the determination of various drugs in complex matrices such as serum, and a limit of detection as low as 2 pg mL<sup>-1</sup> was achieved. The corresponding recoveries ranged from 93.2% to 107.2%. The developed protocol is promising in high-sensitivity analysis of target drugs in complex sample matrices.","adsorbent, mass spectrometry, zinc oxide",Drug Testing And Analysis,adsorb play signific role enhanc analyt sensit target analyt complex sampl mitig matrix effect recent report zno stood among variou adsorb determin target therapeut drug complex biolog matric appli portabl electrospray ioniz mass spectrometri howev influenc morpholog zno perform elus herein differ morpholog zno particl prepar via ultrason method capabl determin differ therapeut drug serum system investig result demonstr zno gave superior capac analysi sensit higher achiev zno morpholog character reveal uniqu perform zno close associ favor desorpt behavior drug small spray plume spray emitt tip coat paper substrat illustr potenti zno coat paper use substrat determin variou drug complex matric serum limit detect low pg ml sup achiev correspond recoveri rang develop protocol promis analysi target drug complex sampl matric influenc zno morpholog capabl portabl electrospray ioniz mass spectrometri determin therapeut drug complex matric
252,Binder-block copolymer micelle interactions in bactericidal filter paper.,"We previously produced a bactericidal filter paper loaded with PAA47-b-PS214 block copolymer micelles containing the biocide triclosan (TCN), using cationic polyacryamide (cPAM) as a binder. However, we encountered a very slow filtration, resulting in long bacteria deactivation times. Slow drainage occurred only when the filter paper was left to dry. It appears that the filter paper with cPAM and micelles develops hydrophobic properties responsible for this very slow filtration. Three approaches were taken to accelerate the very slow drainage all based on modification of binder-micelle interactions: (i) keeping the micelles wet, (ii) modification of the corona, and (iii) replacing cPAM with smaller and more highly charged cationic poly(isopropanol dimethylammonium) chloride (PIDMAC). In all cases, the drainage time of bactericidal filter paper became close to that of untreated filter paper, without decreasing its efficiency. Moreover, replacing cPAM with PIDMAC led to a much more efficient bactericidal filter paper that reduced bacteria viability by more than 6 orders of magnitude. In addition to resolving the hydrophobic drainage hurdle, the three solutions also offer a better understanding of the interaction between cPAM and micelles in the filter paper.",no keywords,Langmuir : The Acs Journal Of Surfaces And Colloids,previous produc bactericid filter paper load block copolym micel contain biocid triclosan tcn use cation polyacryamid cpam binder howev encount slow filtrat result long bacteria deactiv time slow drainag occur filter paper left dri appear filter paper cpam micel develop hydrophob properti respons slow filtrat three approach taken acceler slow drainag base modif interact keep micel wet ii modif corona iii replac cpam smaller highli charg cation poli isopropanol dimethylammonium chlorid pidmac case drainag time bactericid filter paper becam close untreat filter paper without decreas effici moreov replac cpam pidmac led much effici bactericid filter paper reduc bacteria viabil order magnitud addit resolv hydrophob drainag hurdl three solut also offer better understand interact cpam micel filter paper copolym micel interact bactericid filter paper

After being treated with trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) via a simple thermal chemical vapor deposition process, the resulting CBAs were rendered both hydrophobic and oleophilic. Successful silanization on the surface of the porous CBA was verified by a variety of techniques including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), and water contact angle (WCA) measurements. As a result, the silane-coated, interconnected CBAs not only exhibited good absorption performance for oils (e.g., waste engine oil), but also showed absorption capacity for organic solvents such as chloroform (with a representative weight gain ranging from 11 to 22 times of their own dry weight), making them diversified absorbents for potential applications including sewage purification.","aerogel, cellulose, ionic liquid, waste newspaper",Carbohydrate Polymers,aerogel cba prepar wast newspap wnp without pretreat use chlorid amimcl solvent via regener environment friendli method treat trimethylchlorosilan tmc via simpl thermal chemic vapor deposit process result cba render hydrophob oleophil success silan surfac porou cba verifi varieti techniqu includ scan electron microscopi sem analysi edx water contact angl wca measur result interconnect cba exhibit good absorpt perform oil wast engin oil also show absorpt capac organ solvent chloroform repres weight gain rang time dri weight make diversifi absorb potenti applic includ sewag purif fabric aerogel wast newspap without pretreat use absorb

255,A simple computer-assisted quantification of contrast in a fingerprint.,"A simple method for quantification of contrast in a fingerprint is proposed. Contrast is defined as the average difference in intensity of pixels between valleys and ridges in a fingerprint. It is quantified from a scanner-acquired image of the fingerprint using a histogram function of Adobe Photoshop. The method was validated with black inked prints and marks developed with aluminum powder. Moreover, we tested resistance of the method to rater-dependent errors and dependence of the measurements on the resolution of an image and the model of the scanner. For both groups of fingerprints, the method gave coherent and easily interpretable quantitative values for contrast. There were no significant differences between measurements performed by different raters and by the same rater in a test-retest procedure. However, the method was found to be instrument dependent, as measurements were significantly affected by image resolution and the model of the scanner.","criminalistics, fingerprint development, fingerprint image, fingerprint quality, fingerprints, forensic science",Journal Of Forensic Sciences,simpl method quantif contrast fingerprint propos contrast defin averag differ intens pixel valley ridg fingerprint quantifi imag fingerprint use histogram function adob photoshop method valid black ink print mark develop aluminum powder moreov test resist method error depend measur resolut imag model scanner group fingerprint method gave coher easili interpret quantit valu contrast signific differ measur perform differ rater rater procedur howev method found instrument depend measur significantli affect imag resolut model scanner simpl quantif contrast fingerprint
256,Medicine's perception of reality - a split picture: critical reflections on apparent anomalies within the biomedical theory of science.,"Escalating costs, increasing multi-morbidity, medically unexplained health problems, complex risk, poly-pharmacy and antibiotic resistance can be regarded as artefacts of the traditional knowledge production in Western medicine, arising from its particular worldview. Our paper presents a historically grounded critical analysis of this view. The materialistic shift of Enlightenment philosophy, separating subjectivity from bodily matter, became normative for modern medicine and yielded astonishing results. The traditional dichotomies of mind/body and subjective/objective are, however, incompatible with modern biological theory. Medical knowledge ignores central tenets of human existence, notably the physiological impact of subjective experience, relationships, history and sociocultural contexts. Biomedicine will not succeed in resolving today's poorly understood health problems by doing 'more of the same'. We must acknowledge that health, sickness and bodily functioning are interwoven with human meaning-production, fundamentally personal and biographical. This implies that the biomedical framework, although having engendered 'success stories' like the era of antibiotics, needs to be radically revised.","dichotomies, general practice, lived body, medical anomalies, phenomenology",Journal Of Evaluation In Clinical Practice,escal cost increas medic unexplain health problem complex risk antibiot resist regard artefact tradit knowledg product western medicin aris particular worldview paper present histor ground critic analysi view materialist shift enlighten philosophi separ subject bodili matter becam norm modern medicin yield astonish result tradit dichotomi howev incompat modern biolog theori medic knowledg ignor central tenet human exist notabl physiolog impact subject experi relationship histori sociocultur context biomedicin succeed resolv today poorli understood health problem must acknowledg health sick bodili function interwoven human fundament person biograph impli biomed framework although engend stori like era antibiot need radic revis medicin percept realiti split pictur critic reflect appar anomali within biomed theori scienc

258,"New psychoactive substances (NPS) prevalence over LSD in blotter seized in State of Santa Catarina, Brazil: A six-year retrospective study.","Designer drugs or new psychoactive substances (NPS) are a heterogeneous group of substances obtained through the modification of chemical structure of some natural products or drugs. NPS illegally commercialized in blotter papers mimicking the most common form of LSD consumption, with a great variability of colours and symbols, have largely increased worldwide, including in Brazil, becoming an important emerging public health issue. In this study, we have evaluated the presence and profile of NPS in blotters seized in the State of Santa Catarina, Brazil, over the period of 2011 to 2017. The state government criminal forensics staff has performed gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) analyses in order to determine the chemical composition of the blotters. During the evaluated period, there was a considerable increase in the seizing of blotters events, from 87 in 2011, to 301 in 2016 and reaching 277 in 2017. There was also an increase in the number of blotters seized per event. Interestingly, while in 2011, 100% of blotters contained LSD, this number decreased to 0,1% in 2014, and achieved 17,6% in 2017, when up to 25 different substances were detected in blotters seized. Drugs such as DOx, NBOMe, fentanyl, mescaline derivatives, triptamines, cathinones, and synthetic cannabinoids were detected and became the major substances found in blotters. In some cases, more than one substance was found in the same blotter, characterizing a new mixture scenario. The presence of several new psychoactive substances in blotters is a reality in forensic toxicology. In Brazil, it might be related to the fact that most of these substances were not considered illegal by Brazilian legislation by the time they emerged.","chemical profile, lsd, new psychoactive substances (nps), paper blotters",Forensic Science International,design drug new psychoact substanc np heterogen group substanc obtain modif chemic structur natur product drug np illeg commerci blotter paper mimick common form lsd consumpt great variabl colour symbol larg increas worldwid includ brazil becom import emerg public health issu studi evalu presenc profil np blotter seiz state santa catarina brazil period state govern crimin forens staff perform ga spectromet analys order determin chemic composit blotter evalu period consider increas seiz blotter event reach also increas number blotter seiz per event interestingli blotter contain lsd number decreas achiev differ substanc detect blotter seiz drug dox nbome fentanyl mescalin deriv triptamin cathinon synthet cannabinoid detect becam major substanc found blotter case one substanc found blotter character new mixtur scenario presenc sever new psychoact substanc blotter realiti forens toxicolog brazil might relat fact substanc consid illeg brazilian legisl time emerg new psychoact substanc np preval lsd blotter seiz state santa catarina brazil retrospect studi
259,Exploring the chemical profile of designer drugs by ESI(+) and PSI(+) mass spectrometry-An approach on the fragmentation mechanisms and chemometric analysis.,"The consumption of design drugs, frequently known as new psychoactive substances (NPS), has increased considerably worldwide, becoming a severe issue for the responsible governmental agencies. These illicit substances can be defined as synthetic compounds produced in clandestine laboratories in order to act as analogs of schedule drugs mimetizing its chemical structure and improving its pharmacological effects while hampering the control and making regulation more complicated. In this way, the development of new methodologies for chemical analysis of NPS drugs is indispensable to determine a novel class of drugs arising from the underground market. Therefore, this work shows the use of high-resolution mass spectrometry Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) applying different ionization sources such as paper spray ionization (PSI) and electrospray ionization (ESI) in the evaluation of miscellaneous of seized drugs samples as blotter paper (n = 79) and tablet (n = 100). Also, an elucidative analysis was performed by ESI(+)MS/MS experiments, and fragmentation mechanisms were proposed to confirm the chemical structure of compounds identified. Besides, the results of ESI(+) and PSI(+)-FT-ICR MS were compared with those of GC-MS, revealing that ESI(+)MS showed greater detection efficiency among the methodologies employed in this study. Moreover, this study stands out as a guide for the chemical analysis of NPS drugs, highlighting the differences between the techniques of ESI(+)-FT-ICR MS, PSI(+)-FT-ICR MS, and GC-MS.","esi, gc-ms, psi, designer drugs, new psychoactive substances (nps)",Journal Of Mass Spectrometry : Jms,consumpt design drug frequent known new psychoact substanc np increas consider worldwid becom sever issu respons government agenc illicit substanc defin synthet compound produc clandestin laboratori order act analog schedul drug mimet chemic structur improv pharmacolog effect hamper control make regul complic way develop new methodolog chemic analysi np drug indispens determin novel class drug aris underground market therefor work show use mass spectrometri fourier transform ion cyclotron reson mass spectrometri m appli differ ioniz sourc paper spray ioniz psi electrospray ioniz esi evalu miscellan seiz drug sampl blotter paper n tablet n also elucid analysi perform esi experi fragment mechan propos confirm chemic structur compound identifi besid result esi psi m compar reveal esi m show greater detect effici among methodolog employ studi moreov studi stand guid chemic analysi np drug highlight differ techniqu esi m psi m explor chemic profil design drug esi psi mass approach fragment mechan chemometr analysi
260,Sub-ppt Mass Spectrometric Detection of Therapeutic Drugs in Complex Biological Matrixes Using Polystyrene-Microsphere-Coated Paper Spray.,"Polystyrene (PS) is a class of polymer materials that offers great potential for various applications. However, the applications of PS microspheres in paper spray mass spectrometry are largely underexplored. Herein we prepared a series of PS microspheres via a simple dispersion polymerization and then used them as coating materials for paper spray mass spectrometry (MS) in high-sensitivity analysis of various therapeutic drugs in complex biological matrixes. In the preparation of PS-coated papers, the coating method was found playing a key role in determining the performance of the resulting paper substrate in addition to other parameters (e.g., starch type and amount, PS coating amount, and spray solvent). We also found that as a solvent was applied on PS-coated paper for paper spray, the analytes of interest would be first extracted out and then moved to the tip of paper triangle for spray along with the applied solvent. In the process, the surface energy of PS particles had a strong impact on the desorption performance of analytes from PS-coated paper substrate, and the PS with a high surface energy favored the elution of analytes to allow a high MS sensitivity. When the prepared PS coated paper was used as a substrate for paper spray, it gave high sensitivity in analysis of therapeutic drugs in various biological matrixes such as whole blood, serum, and urine with excellent repeatability and reproducibility. In contrast to uncoated filter paper, an improvement of 10-546-fold in sensitivity was achieved using PS-coated paper for paper spray, and an estimated lower limit of quantitation (LLOQs) in the range of 0.004-0.084 ng mL<sup>-1</sup> was obtained. The present study is significant in exploring the potential of PS for high-sensitivity MS analysis, and it provides a promising platform in the translation of the MS technique to clinical applications.",no keywords,Analytical Chemistry,polystyren p class polym materi offer great potenti variou applic howev applic p microspher paper spray mass spectrometri larg underexplor herein prepar seri p microspher via simpl dispers polymer use coat materi paper spray mass spectrometri m analysi variou therapeut drug complex biolog matrix prepar paper coat method found play key role determin perform result paper substrat addit paramet starch type amount p coat amount spray solvent also found solvent appli paper paper spray analyt interest would first extract move tip paper triangl spray along appli solvent process surfac energi p particl strong impact desorpt perform analyt paper substrat p high surfac energi favor elut analyt allow high m sensit prepar p coat paper use substrat paper spray gave high sensit analysi therapeut drug variou biolog matrix whole blood serum urin excel repeat reproduc contrast uncoat filter paper improv sensit achiev use paper paper spray estim lower limit quantit lloq rang ng ml sup obtain present studi signific explor potenti p m analysi provid promis platform translat m techniqu clinic applic mass spectrometr detect therapeut drug complex biolog matrix use paper spray
261,Combining the geometry of folded paper with liquid-infused polymer surfaces to concentrate and localize bacterial solutions.,"Point-of-care (POC) detection and diagnostic platforms provide critical information about health and safety conditions in austere and resource-limited settings in which medical, military, and disaster relief operations are conducted. In this work, low-cost paper materials commonly used in POC devices are coated with liquid-infused polymer surfaces and folded to produce geometries that precisely localize complex liquid samples undergoing concentration by evaporation. Liquid-infused polymer surfaces were fabricated by infusing silicone-coated paper with a chemically compatible polydimethylsiloxane oil to create a liquid overlayer. Tests on these surfaces showed no remaining bacterial cells after exposure to a sliding droplet containing a concentrated solution of Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus, while samples without a liquid layer showed adhesion of both microdroplets and individual bacterial cells. Folding of the paper substrates with liquid-infused polymer surfaces into several functional 3D geometries enabled a clean separation and simultaneous concentration of a liquid containing rhodamine dye into discrete, predefined locations. When used with bacteria, which are known for their ability to adhere to nearly any surface type, functional geometries with liquid-infused polymer surfaces concentrated the cells at levels significantly higher than geometries with dry control surfaces. These results show the potential of synergistically combining paper-based materials with liquid-infused polymer surfaces for the manipulation and handling of complex samples, which may help the future engineering of POC devices.",no keywords,Biointerphases,poc detect diagnost platform provid critic inform health safeti condit auster set medic militari disast relief oper conduct work paper materi commonli use poc devic coat polym surfac fold produc geometri precis local complex liquid sampl undergo concentr evapor polym surfac fabric infus paper chemic compat polydimethylsiloxan oil creat liquid overlay test surfac show remain bacteri cell exposur slide droplet contain concentr solut escherichia coli staphylococcu aureu sampl without liquid layer show adhes microdroplet individu bacteri cell fold paper substrat polym surfac sever function geometri enabl clean separ simultan concentr liquid contain rhodamin dye discret predefin locat use bacteria known abil adher nearli surfac type function geometri polym surfac concentr cell level significantli higher geometri dri control surfac result show potenti synergist combin materi polym surfac manipul handl complex sampl may help futur engin poc devic combin geometri fold paper polym surfac concentr local bacteri solut
262,Silica coated paper substrate for paper-spray analysis of therapeutic drugs in dried blood spots.,"Paper spray is a newly developed ambient ionization method that has been applied for direct qualitative and quantitative analysis of biological samples. The properties of the paper substrate and spray solution have a significant impact on the release of chemical compounds from complex sample matrices, the diffusion of the analytes through the substrate, and the formation of ions for mass spectrometry analysis. In this study, a commercially available silica-coated paper was explored in an attempt to improve the analysis of therapeutic drugs in dried blood spots (DBS). The dichloromethane/isopropanol solvent has been identified as an optimal spray solvent for the analysis. The comparison was made with paper spray using chromatography paper as substrate with methanol/water as solvent for the analysis of verapamil, citalopram, amitriptyline, lidocaine, and sunitinib in dried blood spots. It has been demonstrated that the efficiency of recovery of the analytes was notably improved with the silica coated paper and the limit of quantitation (LOQ) for the drug analysis was 0.1 ng mL(-1) using a commercial triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. The use of silica paper substrate also resulted in a sensitivity improvement of 5-50-fold in comparison with chromatography papers, including the Whatman ET31 paper used for blood cards. Analysis using a hand-held miniature mass spectrometer Mini 11 gave LOQs of 10-20 ng mL(-1) for the tested drugs, which is sufficient to cover the therapeutic ranges of these drugs.",no keywords,Analytical Chemistry,paper spray newli develop ambient ioniz method appli direct qualit quantit analysi biolog sampl properti paper substrat spray solut signific impact releas chemic compound complex sampl matric diffus analyt substrat format ion mass spectrometri analysi studi commerci avail paper explor attempt improv analysi therapeut drug dri blood spot db solvent identifi optim spray solvent analysi comparison made paper spray use chromatographi paper substrat solvent analysi verapamil citalopram amitriptylin lidocain sunitinib dri blood spot demonstr effici recoveri analyt notabl improv silica coat paper limit quantit loq drug analysi ng ml use commerci tripl quadrupol mass spectromet use silica paper substrat also result sensit improv comparison chromatographi paper includ whatman paper use blood card analysi use miniatur mass spectromet mini gave loq ng ml test drug suffici cover therapeut rang drug silica coat paper substrat analysi therapeut drug dri blood spot

264,Substituted naphthoquinones as novel amino acid sensitive reagents for the detection of latent fingermarks on paper surfaces.,"In this paper, we present our preliminary studies into naphthoquinones as novel reagents for the detection of latent fingermarks on paper. Latent fingermarks deposited on paper substrates were treated with solutions of selected naphthoquinones in ethyl acetate/HFE-7100, with subsequent heating. The selected compounds were 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid, 1,2-naphthoquinone-4-sulfonate, 2-methoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone and 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone. All of the tested compounds yielded purple-brown visible fingermarks, which also exhibited photoluminescence when illuminated with a high intensity filtered light source at 555 nm and viewed through red goggles. Indirect heat using an oven at 150°C for 1h was found to be superior to direct heat with an iron, which while providing faster development lead to increased levels of background colouration. Luminescence spectrophotometry revealed differences in photoluminescence characteristics for fingermarks developed with the different naphthoquinones, with excitation over the range 530-590 nm. Luminescence spectrophotometry of developed lysine, glycine and serine spots on paper was used to confirm that the naphthoquinones were reacting with amino acids in the latent fingermark.",no keywords,Talanta,paper present preliminari studi naphthoquinon novel reagent detect latent fingermark paper latent fingermark deposit paper substrat treat solut select naphthoquinon ethyl subsequ heat select compound acid test compound yield visibl fingermark also exhibit photoluminesc illumin high intens filter light sourc nm view red goggl indirect heat use oven found superior direct heat iron provid faster develop lead increas level background colour luminesc spectrophotometri reveal differ photoluminesc characterist fingermark develop differ naphthoquinon excit rang nm luminesc spectrophotometri develop lysin glycin serin spot paper use confirm naphthoquinon react amino acid latent fingermark substitut naphthoquinon novel amino acid sensit reagent detect latent fingermark paper surfac
265,Impedimetric quantification of cells encapsulated in hydrogel cultured in a paper-based microchamber.,"Recently, 3D cell culture technique was proposed to provide a more physiologically-meaningful environment for cell-based assays. With the development of microfluidics technology, cellular response can be quantified by impedance measurement technique in a real-time and non-invasive manner. However, handling of these microfluidic systems requires a trained engineering personnel and the operation is not compatible to traditional biological research laboratories. In this work, we incorporated the impedance measurement technique to paper-based 3D cell culture model and demonstrated non-invasive quantification of cells encapsulated in hydrogel during the culture course. A cellulose filter paper was patterned with an array of circular microchambers. Cells were encapsulated in hydrogel and loaded to the microchambers for culturing cells in 3D environment. At the preset schedule during the culture course, the paper was placed on a glass substrate with measurement electrodes for the impedance measurement. Cells in each microchamber was represented by impedance magnitude and cell proliferation could be studied over time. Also, conventional bio-assay was performed to further confirm the feasibility of the impedimetric quantification of cells encapsulated in hydrogel cultured in the paper-based microchamber. This technique provides a convenient, fast, and non-invasive approach to monitor cells cultured in 3D environment. It has potential to be developed for routine 3D cell culture protocol in biological research laboratories.","3d cell culture, cell proliferation, impedance measurement",Talanta,recent cell cultur techniqu propos provid environ assay develop microfluid technolog cellular respons quantifi imped measur techniqu manner howev handl microfluid system requir train engin personnel oper compat tradit biolog research laboratori work incorpor imped measur techniqu cell cultur model demonstr quantif cell encapsul hydrogel cultur cours cellulos filter paper pattern array circular microchamb cell encapsul hydrogel load microchamb cultur cell environ preset schedul cultur cours paper place glass substrat measur electrod imped measur cell microchamb repres imped magnitud cell prolifer could studi time also convent perform confirm feasibl impedimetr quantif cell encapsul hydrogel cultur microchamb techniqu provid conveni fast approach monitor cell cultur environ potenti develop routin cell cultur protocol biolog research laboratori impedimetr quantif cell encapsul hydrogel cultur microchamb

267,Evaluation of DFO/PVP and its application to latent fingermarks development on thermal paper.,"A new method for improved development of latent fingermarks on thermal paper by 1,8-diazafluoren-9-one (DFO) treatment is described. Compared with conventional DFO solution, the mixed solution of DFO/PVP (polyvinylpyrrolidone) described here reduces black background staining without removing the thermosensitive layer and develops fingermarks by the reaction of DFO with amino acid deposited on the thermal paper's surface. An advantage of this approach is that the developed fluorescent fingermarks have high contrast and can be observed and photographed when excited in the 515 nm region and observed through an orange-red barrier long-pass filter with no background coloration. In addition, the method reported here does not involve any pre- or post treatment of the substrate and exhibits high sensitivity with good stability. Experimental results showed that the method was able to develop very old fingermarks, up to 154 days old, demonstrating the feasibility of using the method to develop identifiable latent fingermarks operationally. Furthermore, we extended our experiments to various types of thermal papers. Notably, this method exhibits several very attractive features, namely time saving, simple procedures, inexpensive, convenient operation, and PVP is non-toxic and reasonably priced.

269,'Every bone of my body:' domestic violence and the diagnostic body.,"Diagnostic categories for domestic violence have shifted over time, transforming from a disorder of psychological passivity and acute injury into a chronic and somatically invasive condition. This paper links these changing diagnoses to constructions of the abused body and to victim-blaming narratives. Based on an analysis of medical journal articles, this research identifies two logics that undergird domestic violence diagnoses, the body, and victim-blaming: 1) the logic of injury (1970s-1980s); and 2) the logic of health (late 1980s-present). The logic of injury is associated with overt victim-blaming, a temporally bounded and injured body, and psychological passivity. Once the feminist anti-violence movement gained mainstream credibility, however, the logic of injury fell out of favor as an explanation for domestic violence. What surfaced next was the logic of health, which is associated with chronic diagnoses and what the author calls a temporally extended body. The temporally extended body is flexible and layered, linking up past, present, and future states of disordered embodiment. The author suggests that, rather than ushering in hope and possibility via the logic of health's somatic flexibility, this abused body creates spaces into which new forms of blame and self-responsibility can take shape.","biomedicalization, body, chronic, diagnosis, domestic violence, temporality",Social Science & Medicine (1982),diagnost categori domest violenc shift time transform disord psycholog passiv acut injuri chronic somat invas condit paper link chang diagnos construct abus bodi narr base analysi medic journal articl research identifi two logic undergird domest violenc diagnos bodi logic injuri logic health late logic injuri associ overt tempor bound injur bodi psycholog passiv feminist movement gain mainstream credibl howev logic injuri fell favor explan domest violenc surfac next logic health associ chronic diagnos author call tempor extend bodi tempor extend bodi flexibl layer link past present futur state disord embodi author suggest rather usher hope possibl via logic health somat flexibl abus bodi creat space new form blame take shape bone bodi domest violenc diagnost bodi
270,Political economy of hope as a cultural facet of biomedicalization: A qualitative examination of constraints to hospice utilization among U.S. end-stage cancer patients.,"A growing body of social science literature is devoted to describing processes of biomedicalization. The issue of biomedicalization is especially relevant for individuals suffering from end-stage cancer and hoping that aggressive end-of-life interventions, which are riddled with uncertainty around quantity or quality of life, will produce a 'cure'. To examine hospice underutilization among end-stage cancer patients, we apply the anthropological concept 'political economy of hope,' which describes how personal and collective 'hope' is associated with the political and economic structures that produce biomedicalization processes. Previous studies have examined hospice underutilization among end-stage cancer patients and have identified barriers stemming from patient and physician characteristics or health insurance reimbursement policies. Yet, these studies do not provide an organized synthesis of how barriers articulate, how they are part of the longitudinal decision-making process, or describe the sociocultural context surrounding hospice care enrollment decisions. This paper focuses on US-specific mechanisms and is based on qualitative, in-depth, interviews with physicians at an academic hospital (N = 24). We find that hospice underutilization results from a web of interconnected constraints surrounding end-stage cancer patients. Our research reveals how hospice care contradicts the political and economic structures associated with end-stage cancer care and illustrates how end-stage cancer patients are transformed into a form of biovalue, a fundamental commodity sustaining the political economy of hope.","biomedicalization, cancer, hope, hospice care, political economy, qualitative methods, united states",Social Science & Medicine (1982),grow bodi social scienc literatur devot describ process biomedic issu biomedic especi relev individu suffer cancer hope aggress intervent riddl uncertainti around quantiti qualiti life produc examin hospic underutil among cancer patient appli anthropolog concept economi hope describ person collect associ polit econom structur produc biomedic process previou studi examin hospic underutil among cancer patient identifi barrier stem patient physician characterist health insur reimburs polici yet studi provid organ synthesi barrier articul part longitudin process describ sociocultur context surround hospic care enrol decis paper focus mechan base qualit interview physician academ hospit n find hospic underutil result web interconnect constraint surround cancer patient research reveal hospic care contradict polit econom structur associ cancer care illustr cancer patient transform form biovalu fundament commod sustain polit economi hope polit economi hope cultur facet biomedic qualit examin constraint hospic util among cancer patient
271,The non-positive antiretroviral gay body: the biomedicalisation of gay sex in England.,"Drawing on testimonies from oral history interviews, this paper analyses the implications of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) practices for gay men in England. Through perspectives on biomedicalisation, the paper focuses on three aspects relevant to the construction of technoscientific identities in the realm of HIV prevention: (i) the question of agency of PrEP users in the context of what has been defined as a biomedical intervention, (ii) practices of freedom framed within neoliberal narratives of personal responsibility versus responsibilisation and (iii) the governance of risk in the era of biomedicalisation. The paper concludes that biomedical governmentalities, even those shaped by the rhetoric of personal responsibility, can be understood as rationalities linked more to solidarity and <i>care of the other</i>. Despite this, the use of PrEP in England is also giving way to the configuration of new sexual scenarios shaped by zero-risk mentalities. It will be important to remain alert to the implications of zero-risk scenarios for HIV-related stigma.RésuméEn s'appuyant sur des témoignages provenant d'entretiens centrés sur des histoires orales, cet article analyse les implications des pratiques de la PrEP chez les hommes gays en Angleterre. À travers les points de vue sur la bio-médicalisation, il se concentre sur trois aspects de la construction des identités technoscientifiques dans le royaume de la prévention du VIH : i) la question de la capacité à agir des utilisateurs de la PrEP dans le contexte de ce qui a été défini comme une intervention biomédicale, ii) les pratiques de la liberté, encadrées par les récits néolibéraux sur la responsabilité personnelle, versus la responsabilisation, et iii) la gouvernance du risque à l'ère de la bio-médicalisation. En conclusion de leur article, les auteurs soutiennent que les << gouvernementalités >> biomédicales, y compris celles qui sont déterminées par la rhétorique de la responsabilité personnelle, peuvent être comprises comme des rationalités plus en rapport avec la solidarité et le souci des autres. Malgré cela, l'usage de la PrEP en Angleterre laisse la place à la configuration de nouveaux scénarios sexuels déterminés par les mentalités du risque zéro. Il est important de rester attentif aux implications des scénarios du risque zéro au regard du stigma lié au VIH.ResumenA partir de testimonios obtenidos a través de entrevistas de historia oral, el presente artículo analiza las repercusiones de la PrEP (profilaxis preexposición para el vih, por sus iniciales en inglés) en las prácticas de hombres gais en Inglaterra. Partiendo de perspectivas sobre la biomedicalización, el artículo se centra en tres aspectos pertinentes a la construcción de identidades tecnocientíficas en el ámbito de la prevención del vih: i) la cuestión de la gestión (agency) de los usuarios de la PrEP en un contexto identificado como de intervención biomédica; ii) las prácticas de libertad enmarcadas en narrativas neoliberales de responsabilidad personal versus responsabilización; iii) el manejo del riesgo en la era de la biomedicalización. El artículo concluye que los manejos biomédicos, incluso aquellos moldeados por la retórica de responsabilidad personal, pueden entenderse como racionalidades vinculadas más con la solidaridad y el cuidado de los demás. A pesar de esto, el uso de la PrEP en Inglaterra está cediendo espacio a la configuración de nuevos escenarios sexuales determinados por esquemas mentales de riesgo cero. Debemos permanecer atentos ante las implicaciones que conllevan los escenarios riesgo cero para el estigma vinculado con el vih.","hiv narratives, prep, biomedical govermentalities, biomedicalisation, oral history","Culture, Health & Sexuality",draw testimoni oral histori interview paper analys implic prophylaxi prep practic gay men england perspect biomedicalis paper focus three aspect relev construct technoscientif ident realm hiv prevent question agenc prep user context defin biomed intervent ii practic freedom frame within neoliber narr person respons versu responsibilis iii govern risk era biomedicalis paper conclud biomed government even shape rhetor person respons understood ration link solidar care despit use prep england also give way configur new sexual scenario shape mental import remain alert implic scenario sur de témoignag proven centré sur de histoir oral cet articl analys le implic de pratiqu de la prep chez le homm gay en angleterr à traver le point de vue sur la il se concentr sur troi aspect de la construct de identité technoscientifiqu dan le royaum de la prévention du vih la question de la capacité à agir de utilisateur de la prep dan le context de ce qui été défini comm une intervent biomédical ii le pratiqu de la liberté encadré par le récit néolibéraux sur la responsabilité personnel versu la responsabilis et iii la gouvern du risqu à de la en conclus de leur articl le auteur soutienn que le gouvernementalité biomédical compri cell qui sont déterminé par la rhétoriqu de la responsabilité personnel peuvent être compris comm de rationalité plu en rapport avec la solidarité et le souci de autr malgré cela de la prep en angleterr laiss la place à la configur de nouveaux scénario sexuel déterminé par le mentalité du risqu zéro il est import de rester attentif aux implic de scénario du risqu zéro au regard du stigma lié au partir de testimonio obtenido travé de entrevista de historia oral el present artículo analiza la repercusion de la prep profilaxi preexposición para el vih por su inicial en inglé en la práctica de hombr gai en inglaterra partiendo de perspectiva sobr la biomedicalización el artículo se centrum en tre aspecto pertinent la construcción de identidad tecnocientífica en el ámbito de la prevención del vih la cuestión de la gestión agenc de lo usuario de la prep en un contexto identificado como de intervención biomédica ii la práctica de libertad enmarcada en narrativa neoliberal de responsabilidad person versu responsabilización iii el manejo del riesgo en la era de la biomedicalización el artículo concluy que lo manejo biomédico incluso aquello moldeado por la retórica de responsabilidad person pueden entenders como racionalidad vinculada má con la solidaridad el cuidado de lo demá pesar de esto el uso de la prep en inglaterra está cediendo espacio la configuración de nuevo escenario sexual determinado por esquema mental de riesgo cero debemo permanec atento ant la implicacion que conllevan lo escenario riesgo cero para el estigma vinculado con el vih antiretrovir gay bodi biomedicalis gay sex england
272,Beyond the medicine cabinet: an analysis of where and why medications accumulate.,"Active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) from medications can enter the environment as trace contaminants, at individual concentrations generally below a part per billion (microg/L). APIs enter the environment primarily via the discharge of raw and treated sewage. Residues of unmetabolized APIs from parenteral and enteral drugs are excreted in feces and urine, and topically applied medications are washed from skin during bathing. These trace residues may pose risks for aquatic life and cause concern with regard to subsequent human exposure. APIs also enter the environment from the disposal of unwanted medications directly to sewers and trash. The relative significance of this route compared with excretion and bathing is poorly understood and has been subject to much speculation. Two major aspects of uncertainty exist: the percentage of any particular API in the environment originating from disposal is unknown, and disposal undoubtedly occurs from a variety of dispersed sources. Sources of disposal, along with the types and quantities of APIs resulting from each source, are important to understand so that effective pollution prevention approaches can be designed and implemented. Accumulation of leftover, unwanted drugs poses three major concerns: (i) APIs disposed to sewage or trash compose a diverse source of potential chemical stressors in the environment. (ii) Accumulated drugs represent increased potential for drug diversion, with its attendant risks of unintentional poisonings and abuse. (iii) Leftover drugs represent wasted healthcare resources and lost opportunities for medical treatment. This paper has four major purposes: (1) Define the processes, actions, and behaviors that control and drive the consumption, accumulation, and need for disposal of pharmaceuticals. (2) Provide an overview of the diverse locations where drugs are used and accumulate. (3) Present a summary of the first cataloging of APIs disposed by a defined subpopulation.

273,"Investigating sources of pharmaceutical pollution: Survey of over-the-counter and prescription medication purchasing, use, and disposal practices among university students.","Pharmaceutical pollution in surface waters poses a range of risks to public health and aquatic ecosystems. Consumers contribute to pharmaceutical pollution via use and disposal of medications, though data on such behaviors is limited. This paper investigates the purchasing, use, and disposal practices among a population that has been researched only minimally to date, yet will determine pharmaceutical pollution for decades to come: young adults represented by a university student population. We employed an online, 21-question survey to examine behaviors related to pharmaceuticals among students at the University of Vermont (n = 358). Results indicate that the majority of respondents had purchased medications in the previous 12 months (94%), and had leftover drugs (61%). Contrary to previous studies of older populations, only a small proportion of students had disposed of drugs (18%); municipal trash was the primary route of drug disposal (25%), and very few students disposed drugs via flushing (1%). Less than a quarter of students were aware of drug take-back programs (24%), and only 4% had ever used take-back services. These findings indicate that the university student population may be storing a large volume of unused drugs that will require future disposal. Increasing awareness of, access to, and participation in pro-environment pharmaceutical behaviors, such as purchasing over-the-counter medication in smaller quantities and utilizing drug take-back programs, could minimize future pharmaceutical pollution from this population.","pharmaceutical pollution, pharmaceutical waste disposal, social science survey, sources of pharmaceuticals in wastewater, university demographic",Journal Of Environmental Management,pharmaceut pollut surfac water pose rang risk public health aquat ecosystem consum contribut pharmaceut pollut via use dispos medic though data behavior limit paper investig purchas use dispos practic among popul research minim date yet determin pharmaceut pollut decad come young adult repres univers student popul employ onlin survey examin behavior relat pharmaceut among student univers vermont n result indic major respond purchas medic previou month leftov drug contrari previou studi older popul small proport student dispos drug municip trash primari rout drug dispos student dispos drug via flush less quarter student awar drug program ever use servic find indic univers student popul may store larg volum unus drug requir futur dispos increas awar access particip pharmaceut behavior purchas medic smaller quantiti util drug program could minim futur pharmaceut pollut popul investig sourc pharmaceut pollut survey prescript medic purchas use dispos practic among univers student
274,"Old age and vulnerability between first, second and third person perspectives. Ethnographic explorations of aging in contemporary Denmark.","This paper is based on an ethnographic fieldwork aimed at exploring ethnographically how vulnerability in old age is perceived and experienced in contemporary Denmark. The fieldwork showed remarkable differences between two phases of the fieldwork: the first addressing vulnerability from the ""outside"" through group interviews with professionals, leaders and older people who were not (yet) vulnerable; and the second from the ""inside"" through more in depth fieldwork with older people who in diverse ways could be seen as vulnerable. After a short introduction to anthropological and social gerontological literature on characteristics of ""Western"" aging: medicalization, successful, healthy and active aging, I present findings from both phases of this ethnographic fieldwork arguing that the ethnographic approach reveals the composite and complex nature of vulnerability in old age and the constant interactions between first, second and third person perspectives. Through these methodological and analytical moves a complex and empirically tenable understanding of vulnerability in old age has emerged which 1. moves beyond rigid dichotomies that have characterized the study of old age, 2. integrates individual experience, social interaction and the structural and discursive context into the analysis, and 3. reveals the complex interplay between vulnerability and agency in diverse situations and settings of old age.","active aging, denmark, ethnography, old age, vulnerability",Journal Of Aging Studies,paper base ethnograph fieldwork aim explor ethnograph vulner old age perceiv experienc contemporari denmark fieldwork show remark differ two phase fieldwork first address vulner outsid group interview profession leader older peopl yet vulner second insid depth fieldwork older peopl diver way could seen vulner short introduct anthropolog social gerontolog literatur characterist western age medic success healthi activ age present find phase ethnograph fieldwork argu ethnograph approach reveal composit complex natur vulner old age constant interact first second third person perspect methodolog analyt move complex empir tenabl understand vulner old age emerg move beyond rigid dichotomi character studi old age integr individu experi social interact structur discurs context analysi reveal complex interplay vulner agenc diver situat set old age old age vulner first second third person perspect ethnograph explor age contemporari denmark
275,Iron stains on paper. Can electrophoretic removal become an effective alternative to chemical cleaning?,"Research in restoration and conservation is directed vs. more sustainable working materials, methods and technologies. Electrophoretic removal, from porous material, of undesired stains due to charged species is theoretically an interesting alternative to chemical cleaning methods, but the lack of specific and comprehensive research work leads to controversial opinions about the efficiency and the needed harmfulness for the treated objects. In this work paper, samples with artificial rust stains were subjected to electrophoretic cleaning treatments in mineral water as electrolyte. Treatments were carried out either in a bath by complete sample immersion between the distanced electrodes or by sample wetting and sandwiching between the electrodes. Evaluation of cleaning efficiency and treatment effects was based on colour change measurements (image analysis of scanned paper samples before and after the treatment and by colorimetric data via spectrophotometric measurements), investigation of morphological changes by SEM observations and folding endurance measurements.","electrophoresis, cultural heritage, green chemistry, iron stains, paper, restoration",Natural Product Research,research restor conserv direct sustain work materi method technolog electrophoret remov porou materi undesir stain due charg speci theoret interest altern chemic clean method lack specif comprehens research work lead controversi opinion effici need harm treat object work paper sampl artifici rust stain subject electrophoret clean treatment miner water electrolyt treatment carri either bath complet sampl immers distanc electrod sampl wet sandwich electrod evalu clean effici treatment effect base colour chang measur imag analysi scan paper sampl treatment colorimetr data via spectrophotometr measur investig morpholog chang sem observ fold endur measur iron stain paper electrophoret remov becom effect altern chemic clean
276,Two-dimensional paper networks: programmable fluidic disconnects for multi-step processes in shaped paper.,"Most laboratory assays take advantage of multi-step protocols to achieve high performance, but conventional paper-based tests (e.g., lateral flow tests) are generally limited to assays that can be carried out in a single fluidic step. We have developed two-dimensional paper networks (2DPNs) that use materials from lateral flow tests but reconfigure them to enable programming of multi-step reagent delivery sequences. The 2DPN uses multiple converging fluid inlets to control the arrival time of each fluid to a detection zone or reaction zone, and it requires a method to disconnect each fluid source in a corresponding timed sequence. Here, we present a method that allows programmed disconnection of fluid sources required for multi-step delivery. A 2DPN with legs of different lengths is inserted into a shared buffer well, and the dropping fluid surface disconnects each leg at in a programmable sequence. This approach could enable multi-step laboratory assays to be converted into simple point-of-care devices that have high performance yet remain easy to use.",no keywords,Lab On A Chip,laboratori assay take advantag protocol achiev high perform convent test later flow test gener limit assay carri singl fluidic step develop paper network use materi later flow test reconfigur enabl program reagent deliveri sequenc use multipl converg fluid inlet control arriv time fluid detect zone reaction zone requir method disconnect fluid sourc correspond time sequenc present method allow program disconnect fluid sourc requir deliveri leg differ length insert share buffer well drop fluid surfac disconnect leg programm sequenc approach could enabl laboratori assay convert simpl devic high perform yet remain easi use paper network programm fluidic disconnect process shape paper
277,Deconstructing 'barriers' to access: minority ethnic women and medicalised maternal health services in Vietnam.,"Low maternal health service utilisation amongst minority ethnic women in Vietnam is often attributed to 'traditional customs'. Drawing on secondary data and original, qualitative research amongst Hmong and Thai communities, this paper analyses minority behaviour related to childbirth. The informed selectivity in service attendance identified can be considered, in part, a rejection of current medicalised approaches at health facilities, where supine delivery is compulsory and family members are prohibited from attending women in labour. The paper reveals how conventional analyses of barriers to minority maternal health service utilisation inhibit scrutiny of the ways services fail to engage with or accommodate local preferences. Participatory identification of mutually acceptable delivery methods by maternal health staff and local women is recommended to enable the development of culturally inclusive services.",no keywords,Global Public Health,low matern health servic utilis amongst minor ethnic woman vietnam often attribut custom draw secondari data origin qualit research amongst hmong thai commun paper analys minor behaviour relat childbirth inform select servic attend identifi consid part reject current medicalis approach health facil supin deliveri compulsori famili member prohibit attend woman labour paper reveal convent analys barrier minor matern health servic utilis inhibit scrutini way servic fail engag accommod local prefer participatori identif mutual accept deliveri method matern health staff local woman recommend enabl develop cultur inclus servic deconstruct access minor ethnic woman medicalis matern health servic vietnam

The pre-treatments reduced the yield of pulps and their Kappa number noticeably, diminished the degree of polymerization moderately, and increased their brightness. One-step peroxide bleaching of pulps from the pre-treated spruce wood resulted in their higher brightness compared to bleached pulp from sound wood. From the viewpoint of improved properties of pulp, the most efficient were the sodium hydroxide/per-acetic acid and per-acetic acid/sodium hydroxide sequences.

279,Cross-terminology mapping challenges: a demonstration using medication terminological systems.,"Standardized terminological systems for biomedical information have provided considerable benefits to biomedical applications and research. However, practical use of this information often requires mapping across terminological systems-a complex and time-consuming process. This paper demonstrates the complexity and challenges of mapping across terminological systems in the context of medication information. It provides a review of medication terminological systems and their linkages, then describes a case study in which we mapped proprietary medication codes from an electronic health record to SNOMED CT and the UMLS Metathesaurus. The goal was to create a polyhierarchical classification system for querying an i2b2 clinical data warehouse. We found that three methods were required to accurately map the majority of actively prescribed medications. Only 62.5% of source medication codes could be mapped automatically. The remaining codes were mapped using a combination of semi-automated string comparison with expert selection, and a completely manual approach. Compound drugs were especially difficult to map: only 7.5% could be mapped using the automatic method. General challenges to mapping across terminological systems include (1) the availability of up-to-date information to assess the suitability of a given terminological system for a particular use case, and to assess the quality and completeness of cross-terminology links; (2) the difficulty of correctly using complex, rapidly evolving, modern terminologies; (3) the time and effort required to complete and evaluate the mapping; (4) the need to address differences in granularity between the source and target terminologies; and (5) the need to continuously update the mapping as terminological systems evolve.",no keywords,Journal Of Biomedical Informatics,standard terminolog system biomed inform provid consider benefit biomed applic research howev practic use inform often requir map across terminolog complex process paper demonstr complex challeng map across terminolog system context medic inform provid review medic terminolog system linkag describ case studi map proprietari medic code electron health record snome ct uml metathesauru goal creat polyhierarch classif system queri clinic data warehous found three method requir accur map major activ prescrib medic sourc medic code could map automat remain code map use combin string comparison expert select complet manual approach compound drug especi difficult map could map use automat method gener challeng map across terminolog system includ avail inform assess suitabl given terminolog system particular use case assess qualiti complet link difficulti correctli use complex rapidli evolv modern terminolog time effort requir complet evalu map need address differ granular sourc target terminolog need continu updat map terminolog system evolv map challeng demonstr use medic terminolog system
280,A comparative analytical study on reagent-fused silica gel plate and wax painted paper-based microfluidic device for serological testing.,"The detection and identification of body fluids at a crime scene shed light on the events which might have occurred and the people involved in the crime; the techniques used being lengthy, makes the on-scene detection a tough process to carry out and handle. This study aims to develop an on-spot detection method for serological testing using silica gel encapsulation technique and a modified microfluidic paper-based analytical device (μPADs). Kastle-Meyer reagent was incorporated into the μPAD and Silica Gel plate and was subsequently validated for the detection of blood. This study revealed that the μPAD was a better option. The emerging technique of μPADs allows a cost-effective and simple method of detection for body fluids. The fibrous network of the paper is manipulated to fabricate a guided channel for the fluid flow. The guided channels in the modified μPADs were fabricated by patterning a hydrophobic barrier out of wax. The analyte of interest for this study is blood but the principle can be modified to include other biological fluids.","body fluids, crime scene, kastle-meyer test, microfluidic paper-based analytical device (μpad), serological testing, silica gel encapsulation",Forensic Science International,detect identif bodi fluid crime scene shed light event might occur peopl involv crime techniqu use lengthi make detect tough process carri handl studi aim develop detect method serolog test use silica gel encapsul techniqu modifi microfluid analyt devic μpad reagent incorpor μpad silica gel plate subsequ valid detect blood studi reveal μpad better option emerg techniqu μpad allow simpl method detect bodi fluid fibrou network paper manipul fabric guid channel fluid flow guid channel modifi μpad fabric pattern hydrophob barrier wax analyt interest studi blood principl modifi includ biolog fluid compar analyt studi silica gel plate wax paint microfluid devic serolog test
281,Sadness or depression: Making sense of low mood and the medicalization of everyday life.,"This research focusses on low mood as a generic category in everyday social interactions, outside the clinical realm and among non-patients. We examine if and how a clinical depression label and treatment are employed when low mood occurs in everyday life, which enables us to analyze the extent and content of medicalization and brings to the fore the interactional mechanisms and cultural concerns that potentially drive medicalization. The analysis is based on 316 observations of everyday life in the Netherlands. We observed and recorded interactions in which low mood was spontaneously expressed. Our paper shows that the clinical depression label resonates widely even if low mood is not fully medicalized. People de-medicalize low mood, and low mood can be un-medicalized. Our analysis thus suggests that dominance is not achieved, which nuances Horwitz and Wakefield's claim that the clinical category of depression has come to encompass all forms of low mood. Moreover, uncertainties about the meaning of low mood and about the depression label remain pragmatic concerns of everyday life. The cultural norm of happiness and active citizenship are very prominent in everyday life across medicalized and un-medicalized interactions. These norms thus seem to be a necessary but insufficient condition for medicalization. While pragmatic concerns do not seem to trigger medicalization either, one specific type of concern is consistently related to medicalization: relational conflicts. In sum, the cultural construction of low mood is not dominated by a single medical approach; however, it mirrors the diversity and uncertainties within and around the medical field.","depression, everyday life, medicalization, observational methods, the netherlands",Social Science & Medicine (1982),research focus low mood gener categori everyday social interact outsid clinic realm among examin clinic depress label treatment employ low mood occur everyday life enabl u analyz extent content medic bring fore interact mechan cultur concern potenti drive medic analysi base observ everyday life netherland observ record interact low mood spontan express paper show clinic depress label reson wide even low mood fulli medic peopl low mood low mood analysi thu suggest domin achiev nuanc horwitz wakefield claim clinic categori depress come encompass form low mood moreov uncertainti mean low mood depress label remain pragmat concern everyday life cultur norm happi activ citizenship promin everyday life across medic interact norm thu seem necessari insuffici condit medic pragmat concern seem trigger medic either one specif type concern consist relat medic relat conflict sum cultur construct low mood domin singl medic approach howev mirror diver uncertainti within around medic field sad depress make sen low mood medic everyday life

283,Fluorescent and visual detection of norfloxacin in aqueous solutions with a molecularly imprinted polymer coated paper sensor.,"A dual functional molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) coated paper (MIP-CP) sensor was firstly proposed for rapid fluorescent (FL) and visual analysis of norfloxacin (NOR) in aqueous solutions. The sensor was fabricated via a sol-gel technique, and characterized by FTIR and SEM. The extraction capacity, selectivity, detection limit, and linear range of the MIP-CP sensor were studied by an FL spectrophotometer. The modified paper sensor showed good selectivity and high extraction capacity for NOR and its structural analogues. For FL analysis of NOR, the linear range and detection limit were found to be 10-100 ng/ml and 2.59 ng/ml, respectively. The visual determination of NOR (under UV light) based on the MIP-CP sensor was also explored, and the determination limit was found to be 0.1 μg/ml. Finally, the proposed methods were successfully applied to the direct determination of NOR in pharmaceutical preparations and cross-validated by UPLC. The MIP-CP sensor might be a potential platform for antibiotic determination due to its multifunction and good analytical performance.","fluorescence analysis, molecularly imprinted polymer, norfloxacin, paper sensor, sol-gel, visual analysis",Talanta,dual function molecularli imprint polym mip coat paper sensor firstli propos rapid fluoresc fl visual analysi norfloxacin aqueou solut sensor fabric via techniqu character ftir sem extract capac select detect limit linear rang sensor studi fl spectrophotomet modifi paper sensor show good select high extract capac structur analogu fl analysi linear rang detect limit found respect visual determin uv light base sensor also explor determin limit found final propos method success appli direct determin pharmaceut prepar uplc sensor might potenti platform antibiot determin due multifunct good analyt perform fluoresc visual detect norfloxacin aqueou solut molecularli imprint polym coat paper sensor
284,Geneticization in MIM/OMIM®? Exploring Historic and Epistemic Drivers of Contemporary Understandings of Genetic Disease.,"Prior to the genomic sequencing era, the bible for those working in clinical genetics was McKusick's Mendelian Inheritance in Man (MIM), which appeared in multiple editions between the 1960s and the late 1990s. This catalogue was organized according to general patterns of inheritance and focused on phenotypes. Beginning in the mid-1980s, it was replaced by Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM®), a continuously updated catalogue documenting molecular relationships between genetic variation and phenotypic expression. This paper explores this resource's evolution with attention to how disease is distinguished from clinically irrelevant variation and how phenotypic similarities are captured in cases where there is no obvious genotypic association. It is argued that hybrid compromises are encoded into OMIM®; in addition to serving its key original purpose of being a diagnostic catalogue, it also began to record detectable variations in the genome even if they were not known to be associated with phenotypically visible disorders or even phenotypic variations. Although the impacts of geneticization have been well recognized, particularly in popular media, this example allows exploration of some of the historic, epistemic, and methodological causes that underlie tendencies toward disease geneticization in contemporary medicine, while highlighting that such gene-focused strategies may in fact be warranted in some contexts.","victor mckusick, clinical genetics, disease, genetic variation, geneticization",The Journal Of Medicine And Philosophy,prior genom sequenc era bibl work clinic genet mckusick mendelian inherit man mim appear multipl edit late catalogu organ accord gener pattern inherit focus phenotyp begin replac onlin mendelian inherit man continu updat catalogu document molecular relationship genet variat phenotyp express paper explor resourc evolut attent diseas distinguish clinic irrelev variat phenotyp similar captur case obviou genotyp associ argu hybrid compromis encod addit serv key origin purpos diagnost catalogu also began record detect variat genom even known associ phenotyp visibl disord even phenotyp variat although impact genetic well recogn particularli popular medium exampl allow explor histor epistem methodolog caus underli tendenc toward diseas genetic contemporari medicin highlight strategi may fact warrant context genetic explor histor epistem driver contemporari understand genet diseas

This paper considers dynamics of knowledge production in relation to a specific condition area, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), by investigating how parents of children with ADHD are intervening in knowledge creation about the effectiveness of different treatments for the disorder. It draws on qualitative research carried out between 2009 and 2011 with organisations representing parents of children with ADHD in Ireland, to explore how parents have commissioned evaluations of alternative interventions to medication. Drawing on analysis of 12 semi-structured interviews with both parents and professionals active in the arena of ADHD, documentary evidence, and observation at parent organisations' events, the study demonstrates how parents' interventions have sought to expand the therapeutic domain of ADHD beyond the exclusive realm of biopsychiatry, and the dilemmas they face in making their experiences count in a context where the need for evidence has become paramount in the governance of health.",no keywords,Social Science & Medicine (1982),role patient organis shape medic knowledg particular health condit ill shed light notion inform patienthood dynam knowledg context medicalis paper consid dynam knowledg product relat specif condit area attent deficit hyperact disord adhd investig parent child adhd interven knowledg creation effect differ treatment disord draw qualit research carri organis repres parent child adhd ireland explor parent commiss evalu altern intervent medic draw analysi interview parent profession activ arena adhd documentari evid observ parent organis event studi demonstr parent intervent sought expand therapeut domain adhd beyond exclus realm biopsychiatri dilemma face make experi count context need evid becom paramount govern health put knowledg trial parent evalu altern therapeut regim

288,Gender differences in approaches to self-management of poor sleep in later life.,"In this paper we seek to understand the influence of gender on the different approaches to managing poor sleep by older men and women through the conceptual framework of existing theoretical debates on medicalization, healthicization and 'personalization'. In-depth interviews undertaken between January and July 2008 with 62 people aged 65-95 who were experiencing poor sleep, revealed that the majority of older men and women resisted the medicalization of poor sleep, as they perceived sleep problems in later life were an inevitable consequence of ageing. However, older men and women engaged differently with the healthicization of poor sleep, with women far more likely than men to explore a range of alternative sleep remedies, such as herbal supplements, and were also much more likely than men to engage in behavioural practices to promote good sleep, and to avoid practices which prevented sleep.

289,Tailoring controlled-release oral dosage forms by combining inkjet and flexographic printing techniques.,"We combined conventional inkjet printing technology with flexographic printing to fabricate drug delivery systems with accurate doses and tailored drug release. Riboflavin sodium phosphate (RSP) and propranolol hydrochloride (PH) were used as water-soluble model drugs. Three different paper substrates: A (uncoated woodfree paper), B (triple-coated inkjet paper) and C (double-coated sheet fed offset paper) were used as porous model carriers for drug delivery. Active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) containing solutions were printed onto 1 cm × 1 cm substrate areas using an inkjet printer. The printed APIs were coated with water insoluble polymeric films of different thickness using flexographic printing. All substrates were characterized with respect to wettability, surface roughness, air permeability, and cell toxicity. In addition, content uniformity and release profiles of the produced solid dosage forms before and after coating were studied. The substrates were nontoxic for the human cell line assayed. Substrate B was smoothest and least porous. The properties of substrates B and C were similar, whereas those of substrate A differed significantly from those of B, C. The release kinetics of both printed APIs was slowest from substrate B before and after coating with the water insoluble polymer film, following by substrate C, whereas substrate A showed the fastest release. The release rate decreased with increasing polymer coating film thickness. The printed solid dosage forms showed excellent content uniformity. So, combining the two printing technologies allowed fabricating controlled-release oral dosage forms that are challenging to produce using a single technique. The approach opens up new perspectives in the manufacture of flexible doses and tailored drug-delivery systems.",no keywords,European Journal Of Pharmaceutical Sciences : Official Journal Of The European Federation For Pharmaceutical Sciences,combin convent inkjet print technolog flexograph print fabric drug deliveri system accur dose tailor drug releas riboflavin sodium phosphat rsp propranolol hydrochlorid ph use model drug three differ paper substrat uncoat woodfre paper b inkjet paper c sheet fed offset paper use porou model carrier drug deliveri activ pharmaceut ingredi api contain solut print onto cm cm substrat area use inkjet printer print api coat water insolubl polymer film differ thick use flexograph print substrat character respect wettabl surfac rough air permeabl cell toxic addit content uniform releas profil produc solid dosag form coat studi substrat nontox human cell line assay substrat b smoothest least porou properti substrat b c similar wherea substrat differ significantli b releas kinet print api slowest substrat b coat water insolubl polym film follow substrat c wherea substrat show fastest releas releas rate decreas increas polym coat film thick print solid dosag form show excel content uniform combin two print technolog allow fabric oral dosag form challeng produc use singl techniqu approach open new perspect manufactur flexibl dose tailor system tailor oral dosag form combin inkjet flexograph print techniqu
290,"Heroic struggles, criminals and scientific breakthroughs: ADHD and the medicalization of child behaviour in Australian newsprint media 1999-2009.","There is a dearth of scholarly analysis and critique of the Australian newsprint media's role in the medicalization of child behaviour. To begin to redress this lack this paper analyses newsprint media's use of metaphors that re/describe and construct realities of ADHD with a medicalizing effect. The interdisciplinary team used the Factiva<sup>TM</sup> database to locate and review 453 articles published in Australian national and metropolitan newspapers during the decade 1999-2009. Data analysis involved generating statistical descriptions of the dataset according to attributes such as: date, state, newspaper titles and author names. This was followed by inductive analysis of article content. Content analysis revealed pervasive and striking use of metaphor in newsprint media reporting of ADHD content, especially when describing health professionals, educators, parents and children. This collection of metaphors was striking, and while the metaphors deployed were varied, this diversity seemed underscored by a common functionality that increased the risk that child behaviour was explained using medicalized knowledge. We contend that these metaphors collectively and coherently functioned to simplify and delimit meanings of children's health and behaviour to favour depictions that medicalize problems of children and childhood.","adhd, child behaviour, medicalization, metaphor, newsprint media",International Journal Of Qualitative Studies On Health And Well-Being,dearth scholarli analysi critiqu australian newsprint medium role medic child behaviour begin redress lack paper analys newsprint medium use metaphor construct realiti adhd medic effect interdisciplinari team use factiva sup tm databas locat review articl publish australian nation metropolitan newspap decad data analysi involv gener statist descript dataset accord attribut date state newspap titl author name follow induct analysi articl content content analysi reveal pervas strike use metaphor newsprint medium report adhd content especi describ health profession educ parent child collect metaphor strike metaphor deploy vari diver seem underscor common function increas risk child behaviour explain use medic knowledg contend metaphor collect coher function simplifi delimit mean child health behaviour favour depict medic problem child childhood heroic struggl crimin scientif breakthrough adhd medic child behaviour australian newsprint medium
291,"Medicalisation or customisation? Sleep, enterprise and enhancement in the 24/7 society.","This paper extends and problematises recent sociological research on the medicalisation of sleep, focussing on trends and transformations in the prospective 'customisation' of sleep in the 24/7 society. What exactly does customisation mean in this context; how does it relate to the medicalisation of sleep; and how salient or significant are these trends to date in the 24/7 society? These are the key questions this paper seeks to address, taking workplace napping and wakefulness promoting drugs amongst the 'healthy' as our comparative case studies. Both we argue, despite their apparent differences and embryonic status to date, provide alternative routes to broadly similar ends. Namely they customise our sleep patterns and practices to fit around the escalating temporal demands of daily life, thereby helping remedy the increasing misalignment between biological and social time. Each, moreover, seeks to improve or optimise safety, productivity and performance in late modern society, where alertness is prized, sleepiness is problematised and vigilance is valorised. The paper concludes with some further reflections on these matters, including relations between the biomedicalisation and the customisation of sleep and a research agenda on the biopolitics of sleep and wakefulness.",no keywords,Social Science & Medicine (1982),paper extend problematis recent sociolog research medicalis sleep focus trend transform prospect sleep societi exactli customis mean context relat medicalis sleep salient signific trend date societi key question paper seek address take workplac nap wake promot drug amongst compar case studi argu despit appar differ embryon statu date provid altern rout broadli similar end name customis sleep pattern practic fit around escal tempor demand daili life therebi help remedi increas misalign biolog social time moreov seek improv optimis safeti product perform late modern societi alert prize sleepi problematis vigil valoris paper conclud reflect matter includ relat biomedicalis customis sleep research agenda biopolit sleep wake medicalis customis sleep enterpris enhanc societi
292,Quantitative analysis of therapeutic drugs in dried blood spot samples by paper spray mass spectrometry: an avenue to therapeutic drug monitoring.,"A method is presented for the direct quantitative analysis of therapeutic drugs from dried blood spot samples by mass spectrometry. The method, paper spray mass spectrometry, generates gas phase ions directly from the blood card paper used to store dried blood samples without the need for complex sample preparation and separation; the entire time for preparation and analysis of blood samples is around 30 s. Limits of detection were investigated for a chemically diverse set of some 15 therapeutic drugs; hydrophobic and weakly basic drugs, such as sunitinib, citalopram, and verapamil, were found to be routinely detectable at approximately 1 ng/mL. Samples were prepared by addition of the drug to whole blood. Drug concentrations were measured quantitatively over several orders of magnitude, with accuracies within 10% of the expected value and relative standard deviation (RSD) of around 10% by prespotting an internal standard solution onto the paper prior to application of the blood sample. We have demonstrated that paper spray mass spectrometry can be used to quantitatively measure drug concentrations over the entire therapeutic range for a wide variety of drugs.

Addition of the coagulant alum clotted the blood and allowed for immediate sample analysis. The coagulant did not interfere with the function of the paper spray nor did it add features to the mass spectra. Quantitative analysis of therapeutic drugs in the blood was achieved utilizing internal standards which were pre-spotted onto the filter paper. Eight oncology drugs were examined, with lower limits of detection ranging between 0.5 and 17 ng mL(-1) and linear dynamic ranges greater than two orders of magnitude. Inter-day accuracies of quality controls for pazopanib ranged from 102 to 118%, with imprecisions of 9 to 13%.

294,The medicalisation of health inequalities and the English NHS: the role of resource allocation.,"Tackling health inequalities (HI) has become a key policy objective in England in recent years. Yet, despite the wide-ranging policy response of the 1997-2010 Labour Government, socio-economic variations in health continued to widen. In this paper, we seek to explore why. We propose that a meta-narrative has emerged in which the health problems facing England's most deprived areas, and the solution to those problems, have increasingly come to be linked to levels of National Health Service (NHS) funding. This has been, in part, a response to key shortcomings in previous rounds of resource allocation. The very significant sums of money allocated with respect to 'health inequalities' reflects and reinforces the belief that the NHS can and should play a central role in promoting health equity. This medicalisation of HI focuses attention on the role of individual risk factors that lend themselves to medical management, but effectively sidelines the macroprocesses of social inequality, legitimising the kind of society that neo-liberal government has produced in the United Kingdom - one in which health (like other assets) has become a matter of individual and not collective responsibility.",no keywords,"Health Economics, Policy, And Law",tackl health inequ hi becom key polici object england recent year yet despit polici respons labour govern variat health continu widen paper seek explor propos emerg health problem face england depriv area solut problem increasingli come link level nation health servic nh fund part respons key shortcom previou round resourc alloc signific sum money alloc respect inequ reflect reinforc belief nh play central role promot health equiti medicalis hi focus attent role individu risk factor lend medic manag effect sidelin macroprocess social inequ legitimis kind societi govern produc unit kingdom one health like asset becom matter individu collect respons medicalis health inequ english nh role resourc alloc
295,Integration of paper spray ionization high-field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometry for forensic applications.,"Paper spray ionization (PSI) is an attractive ambient ionization source for mass spectrometry (MS) since it allows the combination of surface sampling and ionization. The minimal sample preparation inherent in this approach greatly reduces the time needed for analysis. However, the ions generated from interfering compounds in the sample and the paper substrate may interfere with the analyte ions. Therefore, the integration of PSI with high-field asymmetric ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS) is of significant interest since it should reduce the background ions entering the mass analyzer without complicating the analysis or increasing analysis time.

296,Determination of aerosol oxidative activity using silver nanoparticle aggregation on paper-based analytical devices.,"Airborne particulate matter (PM) pollution significantly impacts human health, but the cellular mechanisms of PM-induced toxicity remain poorly understood. A leading hypothesis on the effects of inhaled PM involves the generation of cellular oxidative stress. To investigate PM-induced oxidative stress, analytical methods have been developed to study the chemical oxidation of dithiothreitol (DTT) in the presence of PM. Although DTT readily reacts with several forms of reactive oxygen species, this molecule is not endogenously produced in biological systems. Glutathione (GSH), on the other hand, is an endogenous antioxidant that is produced throughout the body and is directly involved in combating oxidative stress in the lungs and other tissues. We report here a new method for measuring aerosol oxidative activity that uses silver nanoparticle (AgNP) aggregation coupled to glutathione (GSH) oxidation in a paper-based analytical device. In this assay, the residual reduced GSH from the oxidation of reduced GSH to its disulfide induces the aggregation of AgNPs on a paper-based analytical device, which produces a reddish-brown product. Two methods for aerosol oxidative reactivity are presented: one based on change in color intensity using a traditional paper-based techniques and one based on the length of the color product formed using a distance-based device. These methods were validated against traditional spectroscopic assays for DTT and GSH that employ Elman's reagent. No significant difference was found between the levels measured by all three GSH methods (our two paper-based devices and the traditional method) at the 95% confidence level. PM reactivity towards GSH was less than towards DTT most likely due to the difference in the oxidation potential between the two molecules.",no keywords,The Analyst,airborn particul matter pm pollut significantli impact human health cellular mechan toxic remain poorli understood lead hypothesi effect inhal pm involv gener cellular oxid stress investig oxid stress analyt method develop studi chemic oxid dithiothreitol dtt presenc pm although dtt readili react sever form reactiv oxygen speci molecul endogen produc biolog system glutathion gsh hand endogen antioxid produc throughout bodi directli involv combat oxid stress lung tissu report new method measur aerosol oxid activ use silver nanoparticl agnp aggreg coupl glutathion gsh oxid analyt devic assay residu reduc gsh oxid reduc gsh disulfid induc aggreg agnp analyt devic produc product two method aerosol oxid reactiv present one base chang color intens use tradit techniqu one base length color product form use devic method valid tradit spectroscop assay dtt gsh employ elman reagent signific differ found level measur three gsh method two devic tradit method confid level pm reactiv toward gsh less toward dtt like due differ oxid potenti two molecul determin aerosol oxid activ use silver nanoparticl aggreg analyt devic
297,A novel use of Moringa oleifera seed powder in enhancing the primary treatment of paper mill effluent.,"In this study, Moringa oleifera (M. oleifera) performance as an eco-friendly coagulant in the enhanced primary treatment of paper mill effluent was investigated. Its performance in terms of turbidity removal and COD abatement was examined. Local M. oleifera seed powder from ADRAR-city, South of Algeria, was used. Conventional jar tests were conducted for enhancing the primary treatment of paper mill effluent from paper factory. For this reason, comparative coagulation tests were performed using aluminum sulfate (alum). Indeed, in terms of turbidity abatement, 96.02% and 97.1% were obtained for Moringa and alum, respectively. However, in the case of COD abatement, the abatement rate of M. oleifera seeds was slightly higher than that of alum, 97.28% and 92.67%, respectively. Because M. oleifera is a natural resource that is locally available, an eco-friendly coagulant, non-toxic, and biodegradable and does not affect the pH of water; thus, its use allows to avoid numerous disadvantages of conventional coagulants like alum.","alum, coagulation-flocculation, m. oleifera, paper mill effluent, primary treatment",Chemosphere,studi moringa oleifera oleifera perform coagul enhanc primari treatment paper mill effluent investig perform term turbid remov cod abat examin local oleifera seed powder south algeria use convent jar test conduct enhanc primari treatment paper mill effluent paper factori reason compar coagul test perform use aluminum sulfat alum inde term turbid abat obtain moringa alum respect howev case cod abat abat rate oleifera seed slightli higher alum respect oleifera natur resourc local avail coagul biodegrad affect ph water thu use allow avoid numer disadvantag convent coagul like alum novel use moringa oleifera seed powder enhanc primari treatment paper mill effluent

Droplets were created with different sizes (10 to75μL) and impact velocities (1.4 to 6.0m/s) to strike 176gsm cardstock. Over 2200 droplets were created using the six different fluids and their final dried stain diameter was measured. Droplet spread was plotted using the Scheller and Bousfield correlation and uses effective viscosity as a parameter for non-Newtonian fluids. Comparing the results to an expected whole human blood range validated the spread of the candidate FBS sol-gel material in passive drip bloodstain pattern simulation. These findings complement the practical application of the material as a safe substitute for demonstrating droplet spread under controlled conditions on hard paper surfaces.","bloodstain pattern analysis, forensic blood substitutes, passive drip stain, silicon sol–gels, spreading, thin films",Forensic Science International,work investig spread dynam three candid solut rang viscos surfac tension densiti compar water two commerci blood substitut product droplet creat differ size impact veloc strike cardstock droplet creat use six differ fluid final dri stain diamet measur droplet spread plot use scheller bousfield correl use effect viscos paramet fluid compar result expect whole human blood rang valid spread candid fb materi passiv drip bloodstain pattern simul find complement practic applic materi safe substitut demonstr droplet spread control condit hard paper surfac applic silicon technolog forens blood substitut develop investig spread dynam onto paper surfac

Two types of papers were coated with chitosan-palmitic acid emulsions or with a blend of chitosan and O,O'-dipalmitoylchitosan (DPCT). Micromorphology studies showed that inclusion of hydrophobic compounds into the chitosan matrix was enhanced by grafting them onto chitosan and that this led to their penetration of the paper's core. Compared to chitosan-coated papers, the coating of chitosan-palmitic emulsion kept vapor-barrier properties unchanged (239 and 170 g.m(-2).d(-1) versus 241 and 161 g.m(-2).d(-1)), while the coating of chitosan-DPCT emulsion dramatically deteriorated them (441 and 442 g.m(-2).d(-1)). However, contact angle measurements (110-120 degrees after 1 min) and penetration dynamics analysis showed that both strategies improved liquid-water resistance of the materials.

304,Determination of color developers replacing bisphenol A in thermal paper receipts using diode array and Corona charged aerosol detection-A German market analysis 2018/2019.,"Thermal papers (e.g. point of sale receipts, adhesive labels, tickets) significantly contribute to contamination of paper material cycles and the environment with substances of (eco-) toxicological concern. In particular, they contain color developers like endocrine disrupting bisphenols in typical concentrations of about 1-2 percent per weight (wt%). Bisphenol A (BPA) was used as the common color developer over the last decades, but it will be restricted for thermal paper application in the European Union to a limit of 0.02 wt% from 2020 onwards. Consequently, a variety of BPA substituents such as bisphenol S (BPS) and its derivatives gain importance in thermal paper application. In this study, a rapid, reliable and cost-effective method for identification and quantification of BPA, alternative color developers and related substances like sensitizers is presented based on HPLC separation coupled with diode array detection (DAD) and Corona charged aerosol detection (CAD). Quantification was performed with regard to the intended use of the substances in thermal papers. Besides traditional UV external calibration using reference standards, alternative quantification approaches, in particular UV chromophore concentration for BPS derivatives and CAD universal response technique for low-volatile color developers, were applied and compared in order to allow quantification without reference substances. A market analysis for intended used color developers and sensitizers was performed on thermal paper samples (n = 211) collected in Germany during 2018 and 2019. Pergafast 201 (in 41.7% of the samples) was the most common color developer with concentrations above 0.02 wt%, followed by BPA (36.0%), BPS (13.3%) and other BPS derivatives known as D8, D-90, BPS-MAE and TGSA, that are mainly present in adhesive labels. Sensitizers were determined in over 90% of the samples.","bisphenol a (bpa), bisphenol s (bps), chromophore concentration, corona charged aerosol detector (cad), pergafast 201, thermal paper color developers",Journal Of Chromatography.

305,"A suspending-droplet mode paper-based microfluidic platform for low-cost, rapid, and convenient detection of lead(II) ions in liquid solution.","A paper-based microfluidic device based on unconventional principle was developed and used to detect lead ions through a two-step process including heated incubation and subsequent mixing. The device was made by generating a superhydrophobic pattern, which defines channel and reservoir barriers, on a water-impermeable paper substrate, followed by loading and drying the reagents in the defined reservoirs. Different from the conventional paper-based devices that are made of water-permeable paper, the as-prepared device holds water drops in discrete reservoirs, and the water drops will not move unless the device is titled along the direction of the predefined channels. In this way, the liquid samples applied onto the device are handled as individual drops and could be stored, transported, and mixed on demand. Different from the conventional paper-based devices that use capillary force to drive liquid, our new device uses wetting and gravity as driving force. We name this operation principle suspending-droplet mode paper-based device (SD-μPAD). The use of a Teflon contact-printing stamp makes the production of such devices rapid, cost efficient, and mass productive. Utilizing a G-quadruplex-based luminescence switch-on assay, we demonstrated rapid, convenient, highly sensitive, and low cost detection of lead(II) ions in water samples, using a custom made battery-powered portable device, and a smart phone as the detector.","iridium(iii) complex, lead(ii) ion, paper-based microfluidic device, smart phone, superhydrophobic",Biosensors & Bioelectronics,microfluid devic base unconvent principl develop use detect lead ion process includ heat incub subsequ mix devic made gener superhydrophob pattern defin channel reservoir barrier paper substrat follow load dri reagent defin reservoir differ convent devic made paper devic hold water drop discret reservoir water drop move unless devic titl along direct predefin channel way liquid sampl appli onto devic handl individu drop could store transport mix demand differ convent devic use capillari forc drive liquid new devic use wet graviti drive forc name oper principl mode devic use teflon stamp make product devic rapid cost effici mass product util luminesc assay demonstr rapid conveni highli sensit low cost detect lead ii ion water sampl use custom made portabl devic smart phone detector mode microfluid platform rapid conveni detect lead ii ion liquid solut
306,Inkjet printing of drug substances and use of porous substrates-towards individualized dosing.,"Medicines are most often oral solid dosage forms made into tablets or capsules, and there is little room for individualized doses. The drug substance and additives are processed through multiple production phases, including complex powder handling steps. In drug manufacturing, the control of the solid-state properties of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) is essential and it offers opportunities for enhancement of drug delivery systems. In this context, inkjet printing technologies have emerged over the last decades in pharmaceutical and biological applications and offer solutions for controlling material and product characteristics with high precision. Here we report the concept of conventional inkjet printing technology to produce printable pharmaceutical dosage forms on porous substrates. Data are shown to demonstrate inkjet printing of APIs into paper substrates, and how the model drug substances (paracetamol, theophylline, and caffeine) are penetrating the porous substrates used. The method enables controlling not only the deposition but also the crystallization of the drug substances. We anticipate that the inkjet printing approach has immense potential in making sophisticated drug delivery systems by use of porous substrates in the future. For example, it may offer new perspectives for solving problems around poorly soluble drugs and dosing low-dose medicines accurately. Furthermore, with the advent of genetic mapping of humans, controlled inkjet dosing can bring solutions to fabricate on-demand individualized medicines for patients.",no keywords,Journal Of Pharmaceutical Sciences,medicin often oral solid dosag form made tablet capsul littl room individu dose drug substanc addit process multipl product phase includ complex powder handl step drug manufactur control properti activ pharmaceut ingredi api essenti offer opportun enhanc drug deliveri system context inkjet print technolog emerg last decad pharmaceut biolog applic offer solut control materi product characterist high precis report concept convent inkjet print technolog produc printabl pharmaceut dosag form porou substrat data shown demonstr inkjet print api paper substrat model drug substanc paracetamol theophyllin caffein penetr porou substrat use method enabl control deposit also crystal drug substanc anticip inkjet print approach immens potenti make sophist drug deliveri system use porou substrat futur exampl may offer new perspect solv problem around poorli solubl drug dose medicin accur furthermor advent genet map human control inkjet dose bring solut fabric individu medicin patient inkjet print drug substanc use porou individu dose

Whatman SG81 silica-coated paper was used for the separation of dexamethasone and prednisolone based on the difference in their partition coefficients during the flow of the mobile phase. The optimal mobile phase was composed of 60% ethyl acetate in cyclohexane and required 7 min for separation. The separated steroids on the paper were then quantified by electrochemical detection using differential pulse voltammetry, in which the 3D-printed devices facilitated the measurement. Analytical detection ranges of 10-500 μg mL<sup>-1</sup> were obtained for both dexamethasone and prednisolone (r<sup>2 </sup>= 0.988 and 0.994, respectively). The limits of detection for dexamethasone and prednisolone were 3.59 and 11.98 μg mL<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, whereas the limits of quantification were 6.00 and 20.02 μg mL<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The amounts of both target steroids derived from real herbal medicine samples determined by the proposed method were comparable to those obtained with assays using standard high-performance liquid chromatography. In addition, a simple evaporation step can be used to increase the concentration of the samples before analysis. These ePADs are simple, low-cost, rapid, and very promising for on-site quantitative detection.","dexamethasone, electrochemical paper-based analytical device (epad), herbal medicine, paper chromatography, prednisolone",Analytica Chimica Acta,adulter herbal medicin dexamethason prednisolon regard seriou problem mani commun herein novel platform separ quantif target steroid herbal medicin base electrochem analyt devic epad creat epad compos whatman chromatographi paper devic commerci electrod whatman paper use separ dexamethason prednisolon base differ partit coeffici flow mobil phase optim mobil phase compos ethyl acet cyclohexan requir min separ separ steroid paper quantifi electrochem detect use differenti pul voltammetri devic facilit measur analyt detect rang μg ml sup obtain dexamethason prednisolon r sup respect limit detect dexamethason prednisolon μg ml sup respect wherea limit quantif μg ml sup respect amount target steroid deriv real herbal medicin sampl determin propos method compar obtain assay use standard liquid chromatographi addit simpl evapor step use increas concentr sampl analysi epad simpl rapid promis quantit detect analyt devic coupl electrochem detect determin dexamethason prednisolon adulter tradit medicin

311,A low-cost paper-based platform for fast and reliable screening of cellular interactions with materials.,"A paper-based platform was developed and tested for studies on basic cell culture, material biocompatibility, and activity of pharmaceuticals in order to provide a reliable, robust and low-cost cell study platform. It is based upon a paper or paperboard support, with a nanostructured latex coating to provide an enhanced cell growth and sufficient barrier properties. Wetting is limited to regions of interest using a flexographically printed hydrophobic polydimethylsiloxane layer with circular non-print areas. The nanostructured coating can be substituted for another coating of interest, or the regions of interest functionalized with a material to be studied. The platform is fully up-scalable, being produced with roll-to-roll rod coating, flexographic and inkjet printing methods. Results show that the platform efficiency is comparable to multi-well plates in colorimetric assays in three separate studies: a cell culture study, a biocompatibility study, and a drug screening study. The color intensity is quantified by using a common office scanner or an imaging device and the data is analyzed by a custom computer software without the need for expensive screening or analysis equipment.",no keywords,Journal Of Materials Chemistry.

312,Rapid and on-site analysis of amphetamine-type illicit drugs in whole blood and raw urine by slug-flow microextraction coupled with paper spray mass spectrometry.,"In this study, a slug-flow microextraction (SFME) coupled with paper spray mass spectrometry (PS-MS) method was developed for rapid and on-site analysis of trace amphetamine-type illicit drugs including amphetamine (AM), methamphetamine (MA) and 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine (MDMA) in complex biological samples such as whole blood and raw urine. The method involved the application of SFME for rapid extraction of trace amphetamine-type illicit drugs from whole blood and raw urine samples, followed by PS for direct MS analysis under ambient and open-air conditions. The experimental parameters including extraction solvent, extraction cycle, high voltage, and spray solvent, etc., were all investigated, and the optimized conditions showed an enhanced sensitivity of 1-2 order of magnitudes compared with PS-MS. The method showed good linearity, with correlation coefficient values (r) of no less than 0.9979 for analysis of AM, MA, and MDMA in human whole blood and raw urine without additional sample pretreatments. The limits of detection and quantification were 0.01-0.05 ng/mL and 0.05-0.2 ng/mL, respectively. Satisfactory recoveries were also obtained, with 74.2-94.9% for whole blood and 80.2-103.6% for raw urine, respectively. All of our experimental results demonstrated that SFME-PS-MS showed great potential for rapid, on-site, in situ, and high-throughput screening of amphetamine-type illicit drugs in various biological samples.","amphetamine-type illicit drugs, paper spray-mass spectrometry, raw urine, slug-flow microextraction, whole blood",Analytica Chimica Acta,studi microextract sfme coupl paper spray mass spectrometri method develop rapid analysi trace illicit drug includ amphetamin methamphetamin mdma complex biolog sampl whole blood raw urin method involv applic sfme rapid extract trace illicit drug whole blood raw urin sampl follow p direct m analysi ambient condit experiment paramet includ extract solvent extract cycl high voltag spray solvent investig optim condit show enhanc sensit order magnitud compar method show good linear correl coeffici valu r less analysi mdma human whole blood raw urin without addit sampl pretreat limit detect quantif respect satisfactori recoveri also obtain whole blood raw urin respect experiment result demonstr show great potenti rapid situ screen illicit drug variou biolog sampl rapid analysi illicit drug whole blood raw urin microextract coupl paper spray mass spectrometri
313,Removal of copper from aqueous solution using newspaper pulp as an adsorbent.,"Newspaper pulp was found to be a potential adsorbent for removal of copper from aqueous medium. Detail adsorption study of Cu on newspaper pulp was investigated. Batch adsorption study was carried out as a function of contact time, adsorbent dose, temperature (303-323 K). The experimental data was analyzed using Freundlich, Langmuir, Dubinin-Radushkevich (D-R) and Redlich-Peterson (R-P) isotherm models. It was found that Freundlich, Langmuir and R-P models fitted well. pH variation study revealed that the adsorption increased with increase in pH of the solution. Maximum loading capacity was found to be 30 mg g(-1) at 20 mg L(-1) of initial Cu concentration. Adsorption data were analyzed using two kinetic models, Lagergren first order and pseudo second order. It was observed that pseudo second order represented the best correlation. Langmuir isotherm was used to obtain the thermodynamic parameters such as free energy (DeltaG degrees ), enthalpy (DeltaH degrees ) and entropy (DeltaS degrees ) of adsorption. The negative value of free energy and positive value of enthalpy change indicate that the adsorption of Cu on newspaper pulp is a spontaneous process and endothermic. The results of activation energy also confirmed that the adsorption of Cu on newspaper pulp is physical in nature. Present investigation emphasized that newspaper pulp may be utilized as a low cost adsorbent for copper removal.",no keywords,Journal Of Hazardous Materials,newspap pulp found potenti adsorb remov copper aqueou medium detail adsorpt studi cu newspap pulp investig batch adsorpt studi carri function contact time adsorb dose temperatur k experiment data analyz use freundlich langmuir isotherm model found freundlich langmuir model fit well ph variat studi reveal adsorpt increas increas ph solut maximum load capac found mg g mg l initi cu concentr adsorpt data analyz use two kinet model lagergren first order pseudo second order observ pseudo second order repres best correl langmuir isotherm use obtain thermodynam paramet free energi deltag degre enthalpi deltah degre entropi delta degre adsorpt neg valu free energi posit valu enthalpi chang indic adsorpt cu newspap pulp spontan process endotherm result activ energi also confirm adsorpt cu newspap pulp physic natur present investig emphas newspap pulp may util low cost adsorb copper remov remov copper aqueou solut use newspap pulp adsorb
314,Chemical fingerprint analysis for quality assessment and control of Bansha herbal tea using paper spray mass spectrometry.,"Chemical fingerprinting methodology is an approach for quality assessment and control of herbal medicines and related products based on the holistic chemical profile obtained by various analytical techniques. This study demonstrates the first application of paper spray mass spectrometry (PS-MS) as a chemical fingerprinting methodology for tracing the origins, establishing the authenticity, and assessing the overall quality of a famous herbal product, Bansha herbal tea (BHT). A negative ion PS-MS spectrum yielded the best chemical profiling information and was most appropriate for fingerprint analysis of BHT. In addition to the identification of active ingredients, various compounds present in BHT were simultaneously detected without any sample pretreatment and chromatographic separation, providing valuable information for the quality assessment and control of this herbal product. According to the principal component analysis of the PS-MS fingerprints, two sources of commercially available BHT products made by different manufacturers were easily differentiated. Qualified and expired products from the two manufacturers were also successfully distinguished, and the consistency of the quality between the manufacturers was assessed. Our experimental data demonstrated that the PS-MS chemical fingerprinting is a simple, rapid, and robust methodology for pharmaceutical analysis, with promising prospects for quality assessment and control of herbal medicines and related products with high-throughput.",no keywords,Analytica Chimica Acta,chemic fingerprint methodolog approach qualiti assess control herbal medicin relat product base holist chemic profil obtain variou analyt techniqu studi demonstr first applic paper spray mass spectrometri chemic fingerprint methodolog trace origin establish authent assess overal qualiti famou herbal product bansha herbal tea bht neg ion spectrum yield best chemic profil inform appropri fingerprint analysi bht addit identif activ ingredi variou compound present bht simultan detect without sampl pretreat chromatograph separ provid valuabl inform qualiti assess control herbal product accord princip compon analysi fingerprint two sourc commerci avail bht product made differ manufactur easili differenti qualifi expir product two manufactur also success distinguish consist qualiti manufactur assess experiment data demonstr chemic fingerprint simpl rapid robust methodolog pharmaceut analysi promis prospect qualiti assess control herbal medicin relat product chemic fingerprint analysi qualiti assess control bansha herbal tea use paper spray mass spectrometri
315,The detection of NBOMe designer drugs on blotter paper by high resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOFMS) with and without chromatography.,"New psychoactive substances (NPS) have been associated with fatalities and severe injuries in a number of cases in the United States and have led investigators to rethink traditional drug monitoring protocols. Of particular interest are the variable phenethylamine chemical structures known as 'NBOMes', which pose an emerging threat to public health with incidence steadily growing over the past decade. In this study, direct sample analysis (DSA)-time of flight mass spectrometry was employed to leverage rapid and sensitive ambient ionization mass spectrometry without chromatographic separation as verified with an authentic case sample. Samples for method development were prepared at Boston University School of Medicine's Biomedical Forensic Sciences program (Boston, MA) and analyzed at the State of Maine Health and Environmental Testing Laboratory's Forensic Chemistry Section (Augusta, ME). Preliminary method development work was performed at the University of Central Florida (Orlando, FL). DSA without any extraction step in addition to the evaluation of methanol, dichloromethane and hexane extractions were conducted. Methanol was found to not be a suitable extraction solvent for DSA analysis of these compounds. For the screening of NBOMe designer drug variables on blotter paper, DSA-TOFMS was successful at reducing analysis time to ∼15s per sample, for qualitative identification for the selected analytes of interest. The analysis of an authentic forensic case sample by DSA-TOFMS using the method development parameters demonstrates its utility in forensic laboratories. 25C-NBOMe was identified with an exact mass accuracy of 0.60ppm.","dimethoxyphenyl-n-[(2-methoxyphenyl)methyl]ethanamine, direct sample analysis, nbome(s), new psychoactive substances, time-of-flight mass spectrometry",Forensic Science International,new psychoact substanc np associ fatal sever injuri number case unit state led investig rethink tradit drug monitor protocol particular interest variabl phenethylamin chemic structur known pose emerg threat public health incid steadili grow past decad studi direct sampl analysi dsa flight mass spectrometri employ leverag rapid sensit ambient ioniz mass spectrometri without chromatograph separ verifi authent case sampl sampl method develop prepar boston univers school medicin biomed forens scienc program boston analyz state main health environment test laboratori forens chemistri section augusta preliminari method develop work perform univers central florida orlando fl dsa without extract step addit evalu methanol dichloromethan hexan extract conduct methanol found suitabl extract solvent dsa analysi compound screen nbome design drug variabl blotter paper success reduc analysi time per sampl qualit identif select analyt interest analysi authent forens case sampl use method develop paramet demonstr util forens laboratori identifi exact mass accuraci detect nbome design drug blotter paper high resolut mass spectrometri tofm without chromatographi
316,Vegetal fiber paper matrix impregnated with silica gel for benzene removal.,"Removing benzene from indoor space plays an important role in indoor air purification. A novel filter with vegetal fiber paper (VFP) as matrix hosting silica gel is proposed in this paper for benzene removal. In order to investigate the feasibility and performance of this idea, firstly, three pieces of VFP samples impregnated with different amounts of silica gel are fabricated and their benzene adsorption quantities are tested. The results show that three times is recommended as the optimal number for impregnating. The VFP sample impregnated with silica gel after the third impregnating exhibits commendable coating stability and good benzene adsorption performance. Additionally, at low relative pressure (P<sub>b</sub> /P<sub>s</sub>  ≤ 0.05), the experimental data of benzene adsorption isotherms fit well with the Langmuir model with R<sup>2</sup> greater than 0.97. Then, two actual filters made of VFP impregnated with silica gel after the third impregnating were fabricated. It is found that the pressure drop of the actual filter is only 1200 Pa/m when the air velocity is 2 m/s. Besides, the one-pass efficiency of the filter can reach to 19.44%. It is expected that the silica gel coated on the filter can be modified to improve the purification performance of the filter.","adsorption performance, benzene, filter, pressure drop, purification, silica gel",Indoor Air,remov benzen indoor space play import role indoor air purif novel filter veget fiber paper vfp matrix host silica gel propos paper benzen remov order investig feasibl perform idea firstli three piec vfp sampl impregn differ amount silica gel fabric benzen adsorpt quantiti test result show three time recommend optim number impregn vfp sampl impregn silica gel third impregn exhibit commend coat stabil good benzen adsorpt perform addit low rel pressur p sub b sub experiment data benzen adsorpt isotherm fit well langmuir model r sup greater two actual filter made vfp impregn silica gel third impregn fabric found pressur drop actual filter air veloc besid effici filter reach expect silica gel coat filter modifi improv purif perform filter veget fiber paper matrix impregn silica gel benzen remov
317,Aiming for a moving target: challenges with impactor measurements of MDI aerosols.,"Experiments were conducted to illustrate some of the challenges associated with measuring dynamic MDI aerosols. Experimental HFA-134a solution MDIs containing 8 or 20% ethanol were measured using the Andersen cascade impactor using three different inlets. It was demonstrated that the size distribution of MDI aerosols changes substantially during the measurement process. The measured size distribution was shown to be dependent on the degree of evaporation that has occurred prior to size measurement. Additionally, the degree of evaporation prior to measurement also influences the number of modes present in the measured size distribution. While MDI aerosols appeared to have a separate large particle mode when measured using the U.S. Pharmacopeial induction port (""USP inlet""; [U.S. Pharmacopeia, 1996. Physical tests and determinations <601> aerosols, metered dose inhalers, and dry powders. Pharmacopeial Forum 22, pp. 3065-3095]), the aerosols were shown to be monomodal when measured using a large volume inlet. The apparent large particle mode observed with the USP inlet seem rather to be droplets from the same monomodal distribution that have not fully evaporated. The complex interaction of the MDI plume and inlet configuration was described. Inlet design was shown to influence inlet deposition, measured particle size, and even deposition in the actuator mouthpiece. Inlet deposition was shown to be highly size-dependent with large droplets being collected more efficiently than smaller droplets.",no keywords,International Journal Of Pharmaceutics,experi conduct illustr challeng associ measur dynam mdi aerosol experiment solut mdi contain ethanol measur use andersen cascad impactor use three differ inlet demonstr size distribut mdi aerosol chang substanti measur process measur size distribut shown depend degre evapor occur prior size measur addit degre evapor prior measur also influenc number mode present measur size distribut mdi aerosol appear separ larg particl mode measur use pharmacopei induct port usp inlet pharmacopeia physic test determin aerosol meter dose inhal dri powder pharmacopei forum pp aerosol shown monomod measur use larg volum inlet appar larg particl mode observ usp inlet seem rather droplet monomod distribut fulli evapor complex interact mdi plume inlet configur describ inlet design shown influenc inlet deposit measur particl size even deposit actuat mouthpiec inlet deposit shown highli larg droplet collect effici smaller droplet aim move target challeng impactor measur mdi aerosol
318,Determination of Cr(VI) concentration in diluted samples based on the paper test strip method.,"At present, there are many methods for Cr(VI) concentration determination in diluted samples, however, these methods have their own inherent drawbacks, such as long response time, complicated pretreatment, expensive equipment etc. In this paper, a paper-based test strip method specific for determination of diluted Cr(VI) samples was developed. In this method, Aliquat 336, as an anion exchanger was loaded into filter paper to form a test strip. This test strip was used to pre-concentrate Cr(VI) when contacting with the diluted Cr(VI)-containing solution. The Cr(VI)-containing test strip was then immersed into a diphenylcarbazide (DPC) solution (a color forming solution), and the color intensity was correlated to the Cr(VI) concentration. The detection range of the present method was found to be 0.02-1.50 mg/L. The results also showed that the method gave a high selectivity for Cr(VI) in the diluted samples to be tested. The method was applied to synthesized samples and the results, which were compared to those from a reference method, showed that the developed method is an effective, reliable way for Cr(VI) determination in diluted samples.",no keywords,Water Science And Technology : A Journal Of The International Association On Water Pollution Research,present mani method cr vi concentr determin dilut sampl howev method inher drawback long respons time complic pretreat expens equip etc paper test strip method specif determin dilut cr vi sampl develop method aliquat anion exchang load filter paper form test strip test strip use cr vi contact dilut cr vi solut cr vi test strip immers diphenylcarbazid dpc solut color form solut color intens correl cr vi concentr detect rang present method found result also show method gave high select cr vi dilut sampl test method appli synthes sampl result compar refer method show develop method effect reliabl way cr vi determin dilut sampl determin cr vi concentr dilut sampl base paper test strip method

320,'Learning disabilities' as a 'black box': on the different conceptions and constructions of a popular clinical entity in Israel.,"This article aims to stimulate new thinking about learning disabilities than is customary in local literature. Previous educational and psychological studies concerning learning disabilities regarded them as if they were objective categories with formal definitions and criteria accepted in scholarly literature. Contrary to that, this article explores the various conceptions, constructions, and meanings of learning disabilities that comprise the narrative descriptions and explanations of didactic diagnosticians. For this purpose, 50 in-depth interviews were conducted. There are four sections. Part One lays out the theoretical and methodological background of the sociological and discursive debate about learning disabilities. Part Two explores the various main thematic aspects and narrative strategies that were used by the diagnosticians in their construction of their purportedly 'objective', 'a-historical', 'a-political' experts' narrative. The third part reveals the polyphonic multifaceted nature of the learning disabilities construct. The experts' narrative undermines the objective and homogeneous definitions in the literature by uncovering learning disabilities' heterogeneous meaning repertoire. This repertoire consists, among others, of conceptualizing disability as a 'disease', a 'symptom', a 'genetic defect', a 'disorder', an 'educational difficulty', a 'variance', and even a 'gift'. This part also reveals the experts' narrative reaction strategies to the aforementioned polyphonic spectacle. It is revealed that the interviewees' narrative deconstructs the 'scientific factual nature' of the clinical categories. The fourth part highlights a central paradox in the expert narrative: The tension between the narrative stigmatic-labeling aspects and the destigmatic-'liberating' aspects. The claim is made that this tension can partly explain the current popularity of the LD diagnosis. This article is the third in a series of papers that seeks to contribute to the creation of a more nuanced disability discourse by exposing its shaky scientific foundations.",no keywords,"Culture, Medicine And Psychiatry",articl aim stimul new think learn disabl customari local literatur previou educ psycholog studi concern learn disabl regard object categori formal definit criterion accept scholarli literatur contrari articl explor variou concept construct mean learn disabl compris narr descript explan didact diagnostician purpos interview conduct four section part one lay theoret methodolog background sociolog discurs debat learn disabl part two explor variou main themat aspect narr strategi use diagnostician construct purportedli expert narr third part reveal polyphon multifacet natur learn disabl construct expert narr undermin object homogen definit literatur uncov learn disabl heterogen mean repertoir repertoir consist among other conceptu disabl defect difficulti even part also reveal expert narr reaction strategi aforement polyphon spectacl reveal interviewe narr deconstruct factual natur clinic categori fourth part highlight central paradox expert narr tension narr aspect aspect claim made tension partli explain current popular ld diagnosi articl third seri paper seek contribut creation nuanc disabl discours expo shaki scientif foundat disabl box differ concept construct popular clinic entiti israel

322,Using Adhesive Patterning to Construct 3D Paper Microfluidic Devices.,"We demonstrate the use of patterned aerosol adhesives to construct both planar and nonplanar 3D paper microfluidic devices. By spraying an aerosol adhesive through a metal stencil, the overall amount of adhesive used in assembling paper microfluidic devices can be significantly reduced. We show on a simple 4-layer planar paper microfluidic device that the optimal adhesive application technique and device construction style depends heavily on desired performance characteristics. By moderately increasing the overall area of a device, it is possible to dramatically decrease the wicking time and increase device success rates while also reducing the amount of adhesive required to keep the device together. Such adhesive application also causes the adhesive to form semi-permanent bonds instead of permanent bonds between paper layers, enabling single-use devices to be non-destructively disassembled after use. Nonplanar 3D origami devices also benefit from the semi-permanent bonds during folding, as it reduces the likelihood that unrelated faces may accidently stick together. Like planar devices, nonplanar structures see reduced wicking times with patterned adhesive application vs uniformly applied adhesive.",no keywords,Journal Of Visualized Experiments : Jove,demonstr use pattern aerosol adhes construct planar nonplanar paper microfluid devic spray aerosol adhes metal stencil overal amount adhes use assembl paper microfluid devic significantli reduc show simpl planar paper microfluid devic optim adhes applic techniqu devic construct style depend heavili desir perform characterist moder increas overal area devic possibl dramat decreas wick time increas devic success rate also reduc amount adhes requir keep devic togeth adhes applic also caus adhes form bond instead perman bond paper layer enabl devic disassembl use nonplanar origami devic also benefit bond fold reduc likelihood unrel face may accid stick togeth like planar devic nonplanar structur see reduc wick time pattern adhes applic v uniformli appli adhes use adhes pattern construct paper microfluid devic
323,Coupling frontal elution paper chromatography with desorption corona beam ionization mass spectrometry for rapid analysis of chlorphenamine in herbal medicines and dietary supplements.,"We developed a convenient method by coupling frontal elution paper chromatography with desorption corona beam ionization mass spectrometry (DCBI-MS) for rapid determination of chlorphenamine added in herbal medicines or dietary supplements. In this method, the ethanol extract of the herbal products was spotted directly onto an isosceles triangular filter paper sheet, and then the paper sheet was developed under strong elution condition with the sample zone migrating at the solvent front. The analyte was finally condensed at the V-shaped tip which could then be placed under the visible plasma beam of DCBI for ionization. The overall procedure took less than 5 min. The frontal elution paper chromatography on a triangular plate used in this work improved the signal intensity of chlorphenamine by 30-fold due to the analyte condensing at the tip and the reduction of the background suppression. Furthermore, the paper sheet also functioned as a filter in the analysis of solid or powder samples, which can increase the analytical throughput by omitting the step of centrifugation. The proposed method in current study was successfully applied in the determination of chlorphenamine in herbal medicines. Chlorphenamine was detected in four of the twelve types of herbal medicines examined in this study. The limit of detection was 200 ng/mL (2.0 ng absolute) in full-scan positive-ion mode and the linear range was from 5.0 μg/mL to 50 μg/mL with satisfactory linear coefficient (R(2) (the square of the correlation coefficient)=0.895). Good reproducibility was achieved with relative standard deviations (RSDs) less than 15.0% and the recoveries of chlorphenamine ranged from 84.3 to 90.6%.",no keywords,Journal Of Chromatography.

324,[The frontiers of medicalization: tensions surrounding the identification and appreciation of child malnutrition in a primary healthcare center of the city of Buenos Aires].,"The medicalization of life and its implications for the production of subjectivities are phenomena that have been highlighted by the human sciences in the study of health and disease. Nevertheless, the analysis of its local expressions has been insufficiently covered. The scope of this paper is to explore this field by an ethnographical study of the medicalization process of child malnutrition in a primary healthcare center of the city of Buenos Aires. We will describe analytically the singularities involved in the body perception and the alimentary context by health professionals and their patients. We emphasize that the criteria of perception and moral values that encourage social positions of health professionals and recipients of their actions precluded the institutionalization of a medical vision. We conclude that the process analyzed highlights the need to exceed the medicalization approaches dealing exclusively from the angle of imposition. The social history of the groups involved and ways of establishing relationships in local settings, are essential to understand the peculiarities of these processes.",no keywords,Ciencia & Saude Coletiva,medic life implic product subject phenomenon highlight human scienc studi health diseas nevertheless analysi local express insuffici cover scope paper explor field ethnograph studi medic process child malnutrit primari healthcar center citi bueno air describ analyt singular involv bodi percept alimentari context health profession patient emphas criterion percept moral valu encourag social posit health profession recipi action preclud institution medic vision conclud process analyz highlight need exceed medic approach deal exclus angl imposit social histori group involv way establish relationship local set essenti understand peculiar process frontier medic tension surround identif appreci child malnutrit primari healthcar center citi bueno air
325,Color and texture morphing with colloids on multilayered surfaces.,"Dynamic morphing of marine species to match with environment changes in color and texture is an advanced means for surviving, self-defense, and reproduction. Here we use colloids that are placed inside a multilayered structure to demonstrate color and texture morphing. The multilayer is composed of a thermal insulating base layer, a light absorbing mid layer, and a liquid top layer. When external light of moderate intensity (∼0.2 W cm(-2)) strikes the structure, colloids inside the liquid layer will be assembled to locations with an optimal absorption. When this system is exposed to continuous laser pulses, more than 18,000 times of reversible responses are recorded, where the system requests 20 ms to start the response and another 160 ms to complete. The flexibility of our concept further allows the system to be built on a variety of light-absorbing substrates, including dyed paper, gold thin film, and amorphous silicon, with the top layer even a solid.","colloidal assembly, morphing, photothermal effect, surface tension",Acs Applied Materials & Interfaces,dynam morph marin speci match environ chang color textur advanc mean surviv reproduct use colloid place insid multilay structur demonstr color textur morph multilay compos thermal insul base layer light absorb mid layer liquid top layer extern light moder intens w cm strike structur colloid insid liquid layer assembl locat optim absorpt system expo continu laser pul time revers respons record system request m start respons anoth m complet flexibl concept allow system built varieti substrat includ dy paper gold thin film amorph silicon top layer even solid color textur morph colloid multilay surfac
326,Knowledge-based analysis of multi-potent G-protein coupled receptors ligands.,"A large number of chemical structures that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been disclosed in patents or published papers. Most of these compounds are selective for a given protein target; however, it is well recognized that some GPCR-drugs interact with multiple targets. Using a literature database, we have identified compounds that act on different GPCRs. These protein targets are usually divided in three main classes, A, B and C, based on sequence similarity, but they can also be grouped pharmacologically based on endogenous ligand characteristics. In this paper, we specifically focus on compounds able to recognize two different classes or different pharmacological clusters within the same class. Despite the large number of GPCR ligands described in the literature, we identified a limited number of molecules acting on both classes A and B, only few acting on classes A and C and none acting on class B and C receptors. A search for bi- or multi-potent compounds exhibiting activities on different pharmacological clusters of class A receptors revealed cases of cross reactivity, the most frequent concerning amine and peptide receptor clusters.",no keywords,European Journal Of Medicinal Chemistry,larg number chemic structur interact coupl receptor gpcr disclos patent publish paper compound select given protein target howev well recogn interact multipl target use literatur databas identifi compound act differ gpcr protein target usual divid three main class b c base sequenc similar also group pharmacolog base endogen ligand characterist paper specif focu compound abl recogn two differ class differ pharmacolog cluster within class despit larg number gpcr ligand describ literatur identifi limit number molecul act class b act class c none act class b c receptor search compound exhibit activ differ pharmacolog cluster class receptor reveal case cross reactiv frequent concern amin peptid receptor cluster analysi coupl receptor ligand
327,An adsorbent with a high adsorption capacity obtained from the cellulose sludge of industrial residues.,"One of the major problems in effluent treatment plants of the cellulose and paper industry is the large amount of residual sludge generated. Therefore, this industry is trying to develop new methods to treat such residues and to use them as new products, such as adsorbents. In this regard, the objective of this work was to develop an adsorbent using the raw activated sludge generated by the cellulose and paper industry. The activated cellulose sludge, after being dried, was chemically activated with 42.5% (v/v) phosphoric acid at 85 °C for 1 h and was charred at 500 °C, 600 °C and 700 °C for 2 h. The efficiency of the obtained adsorbent materials was evaluated using kinetic tests with methylene blue solutions. Using the adsorption kinetics, it was verified that the three adsorbents showed the capacity to adsorb dye, and the adsorbent obtained at a temperature of 600 °C showed the highest adsorption capacity of 107.1 mg g<sup>-1</sup>. The kinetic model that best fit the experimental data was pseudo-second order. The Langmuir-Freudlich isotherm adequately described the experimental data. As a result, the cellulose sludge generated by the cellulose and paper industries could be used as an adsorbent.","cellulose residues, coal adsorbent, coal from cellulose sludge, coal from residues",Chemosphere,one major problem effluent treatment plant cellulos paper industri larg amount residu sludg gener therefor industri tri develop new method treat residu use new product adsorb regard object work develop adsorb use raw activ sludg gener cellulos paper industri activ cellulos sludg dri chemic activ phosphor acid h char effici obtain adsorb materi evalu use kinet test methylen blue solut use adsorpt kinet verifi three adsorb show capac adsorb dye adsorb obtain temperatur show highest adsorpt capac mg g sup kinet model best fit experiment data order isotherm adequ describ experiment data result cellulos sludg gener cellulos paper industri could use adsorb adsorb high adsorpt capac obtain cellulos sludg industri residu

329,Compliance spectrum as a drug fingerprint of drug intake and drug disposition.,"Since drug related variability arises from different origins, particularly driven by the behaviour or physiology of the patient, the problems of drug intake and drug disposition are separately presented in general. To overcome the potential drawbacks of this artificial split, we propose in this paper a combined illustrative approach, named compliance spectrum, such that these two subprocesses can be equitably studied and visualized. We construct the compliance spectrum based on the Bayesian decision method we previously developed for the inverse problem of patient compliance within the framework of Population-PK. This spectrum provides an intuitive and interactive way to evaluate the relationship between drug intake and drug disposition along with their consequences on PK profile. As well, it opens a new direction for model quality diagnostic.",no keywords,Journal Of Pharmacokinetics And Pharmacodynamics,sinc drug relat variabl aris differ origin particularli driven behaviour physiolog patient problem drug intak drug disposit separ present gener overcom potenti drawback artifici split propos paper combin illustr approach name complianc spectrum two subprocess equit studi visual construct complianc spectrum base bayesian decis method previous develop invers problem patient complianc within framework spectrum provid intuit interact way evalu relationship drug intak drug disposit along consequ pk profil well open new direct model qualiti diagnost complianc spectrum drug fingerprint drug intak drug disposit
330,Improved refining properties of pulps pretreated with ionic liquids under mild conditions.,"Imidazolium-based ionic liquids (ILs), including 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (BmimCl) and 1-allyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (AmimCl), were used to improve the refining properties of pulps under mild conditions. Results showed that the macro appearance of pulps was virtually unchanged after pretreatment with ILs under mild conditions. In addition, chemical pulps pretreated with ILs are more suitable for pretreatment than chemimechanical pulps. Pretreatment with ILs facilitates the refining process by destroying hydrogen bonds, which exist extensively in fiber. At the same refining energy input, the Canada standard freeness (CSF) of refined pulp decreased with improved fiber quality. At identical CSF values, the energy consumed during refining significantly decreased because ILs pretreatment facilitated swelling and fibrillation. The viscosity of cellulose changed slightly after IL pretreatment. However, the crystallinity index and fines content decreased, and the micro appearance of the fiber surface changed. BmimCl has a stronger swelling influence on pulp than AmimCl under optimal conditions.",no keywords,Bioresource Technology,ionic liquid il includ chlorid bmimcl chlorid amimcl use improv refin properti pulp mild condit result show macro appear pulp virtual unchang pretreat il mild condit addit chemic pulp pretreat il suitabl pretreat chemimechan pulp pretreat il facilit refin process destroy hydrogen bond exist extens fiber refin energi input canada standard freeness csf refin pulp decreas improv fiber qualiti ident csf valu energi consum refin significantli decreas il pretreat facilit swell fibril viscos cellulos chang slightli il pretreat howev crystallin index fine content decreas micro appear fiber surfac chang bmimcl stronger swell influenc pulp amimcl optim condit improv refin properti pulp pretreat ionic liquid mild condit
331,Measuring the reflectance of hidden color objects with acoustically modulated laser speckle.,"We demonstrate a technique to measure the reflectance of colored objects, including blue, green, and yellow, hidden behind an opaque slab based on acoustically modulated laser speckle. One colored paper at a time was placed behind a 1 cm thick opaque slab with an air gap of 5 mm. Small periodic movements (nanometer scale) at 200 Hz were induced in the colored paper. A coherent red He-Ne laser illuminated the front of the slab, producing acoustically modulated speckle patterns, which were captured by a CCD camera. The magnitude of the time-varying speckle intensity is indicative of the hidden colored paper's reflectance.",no keywords,Optics Letters,demonstr techniqu measur reflect color object includ blue green yellow hidden behind opaqu slab base acoust modul laser speckl one color paper time place behind cm thick opaqu slab air gap mm small period movement nanomet scale hz induc color paper coher red laser illumin front slab produc acoust modul speckl pattern captur ccd camera magnitud speckl intens indic hidden color paper reflect measur reflect hidden color object acoust modul laser speckl
332,Improvement of high-yield pulp properties by using a small amount of bleached wheat straw pulp.,"In this study, the potential of using bleached wheat straw pulp (BWSP) was explored to improve the tensile strength of the high-yield pulp (HYP) while preserving its high bulk property. The results showed that with the addition of 5-10% refined BWSP, the HYP tensile strength can be increased by about 10-20% without sacrificing the bulk. Similar results were obtained by adding refined BWSP into a mixed furnish of bleached kraft pulps (BKPs) and HYP. The explanation was that micro fines from refined BWSP can act as binders to improve the HYP interfiber bonding, as a result, the HYP tensile strength can be improved by using a small amount of BWSP, while the HYP bulk is not significantly affected.",no keywords,Bioresource Technology,studi potenti use bleach wheat straw pulp bwsp explor improv tensil strength pulp hyp preserv high bulk properti result show addit refin bwsp hyp tensil strength increas without sacrif bulk similar result obtain ad refin bwsp mix furnish bleach kraft pulp bkp hyp explan micro fine refin bwsp act binder improv hyp interfib bond result hyp tensil strength improv use small amount bwsp hyp bulk significantli affect improv pulp properti use small amount bleach wheat straw pulp
333,Colloids engineering and filtration to enhance the sensitivity of paper-based biosensors.,"Paper-based biosensors represent a disruptive technology by providing instantaneous and low-cost diagnostics for health and environmental applications. The lack of sensitivity can be an obstacle for this technology to compete with traditional analytical instrumentations. Aiming to improve the sensitivity of a paper-based colorimetric biosensor, we have applied colloids engineering in combination with filtration to lower the paper substrate backgrounds and optimize the immobilization of bio-molecules on paper. A model system consisting of an enzyme, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and an inorganic colloid, calcium carbonate (CC), flocculated by a cationic dimethylamino-ethyl-methacrylate polyacrylamide (CPAM), demonstrated that the optimized CC flocs are best for enhancing the detecting sensitivity of ALP. The CC floc structure on paper was optimized by modulating its structure in suspension. Subsequently, the filtration process and the wicking ability of paper enabled to freeze the deposited CC structure inherited from the suspension. The incorporation of biomolecules into the CC before immobilizing on paper through filtration provided not only a better microenvironment, but also a higher surface density of immobilized biomolecules. The ALP detection limit of 117 fmol per zone (5mm circle) in the current study was fifty times lower than that of the common soaking method for biomolecule immobilization. The minimum amount of biomolecules per unit substrate area required for detection was lowered by over an order of magnitude, compared with spotting methods (i.e. inkjet printing). The improvement was also demonstrated by the steepest slope of standard curve, the lowest background, and the highest activity of the bioactive paper probed with the diluted BCIP/NBT liquid substrates.",no keywords,"Colloids And Surfaces.

The pretreatment liquor (PL) contained 42.04 g/L sugars, of which 81.46% was xylose and only 2.91% was glucose. Furfural and hydroxymethylfurfural in PL were 0.37% and 0.06%, respectively. Chemical or enzymatic hydrolysis of carbohydrates could be omitted when producing bioethanol with PL because 87.32% of the total sugars were in the form of monosaccharides. Membrane filtration with a molecular-weight cut-off of 100 Da was employed to concentrate the sugars and a concentration of 170.49 g/L was achieved. A method of zero release of the PL is proposed, which consists of ethanol production from the concentrated PL and recycling the permeate stream into the pretreatment process.",no keywords,Bioresource Technology,test biorefineri concept biomass eulaliopsi binata treat dilut acid prior dissolv pulp product min pretreat liquor pl contain sugar xylos glucos furfur hydroxymethylfurfur pl respect chemic enzymat hydrolysi carbohydr could omit produc bioethanol pl total sugar form monosaccharid membran filtrat da employ concentr sugar concentr achiev method zero releas pl propos consist ethanol product concentr pl recycl permeat stream pretreat process character pretreat liquor biomass perenni grass eulaliopsi binata product dissolv pulp
335,Instant visual detection of picogram levels of trinitrotoluene by using luminescent metal-organic framework gel-coated filter paper.,"There is an ongoing need for explosive detection strategies to uncover threats to human security including illegal transport and terrorist activities. The widespread military use of the explosive trinitrotoluene (TNT) for landmines poses another particular threat to human health in the form of contamination of the surrounding environment and groundwater. The detection of explosives, particularly at low picogram levels, by using a molecular sensor is seen as an important challenge. Herein, we report on the use of a fluorescent metal-organic framework hydrogel that exhibits a higher detection capability for TNT in the gel state compared with that in the solution state. A portable sensor prepared from filter paper coated by the hydrogel was able to detect TNT at the picogram level with a detection limit of 1.82 ppt (parts per trillon). Our results present a simple and new means to provide selective detection of TNT on a surface or in aqueous solution, as afforded by the unique molecular packing through the metal-organic framework structure in the gel formation and the associated photophysical properties. Furthermore, the rheological properties of the MOF-based gel were similar to those of a typical hydrogel.","explosives, gels, metal-organic frameworks, sensors, supramolecular chemistry","Chemistry (Weinheim An Der Bergstrasse, Germany)",ongo need explos detect strategi uncov threat human secur includ illeg transport terrorist activ widespread militari use explos trinitrotoluen tnt landmin pose anoth particular threat human health form contamin surround environ groundwat detect explos particularli low picogram level use molecular sensor seen import challeng herein report use fluoresc framework hydrogel exhibit higher detect capabl tnt gel state compar solut state portabl sensor prepar filter paper coat hydrogel abl detect tnt picogram level detect limit ppt part per trillon result present simpl new mean provid select detect tnt surfac aqueou solut afford uniqu molecular pack framework structur gel format associ photophys properti furthermor rheolog properti gel similar typic hydrogel instant visual detect picogram level trinitrotoluen use luminesc framework filter paper
336,Combining a hydrogel and an electrochemical biosensor to determine the extent of degradation of paper artworks.,"Paper-based artworks are among the most valuable assets for transmission of knowledge. Historical paper is composed of different polysaccharides (e.g. cellulose), binders, and glues. During aging all of these components undergo several degradation processes, as a result of external and intrinsic causes, and these can compromise the state of conservation of the document. In this work, application of a new biotechnological strategy for paper artefact preservation is reported. By making use of innovative and non-invasive materials, for example appropriate hydrogels, in combination with selective electrochemical biosensors, it is possible to simultaneously verify the degradation condition of the paper artwork and then to efficiently clean it, while monitoring the process of removal of both pollution and degradation products. In this paper, we focus on specific examples in which such techniques have been applied to paper artworks and that illustrate the advantages and potential of this biotechnology compared with the traditional paper-cleaning methods currently in use.",no keywords,Analytical And Bioanalytical Chemistry,artwork among valuabl asset transmiss knowledg histor paper compos differ polysaccharid cellulos binder glue age compon undergo sever degrad process result extern intrins caus compromis state conserv document work applic new biotechnolog strategi paper artefact preserv report make use innov materi exampl appropri hydrogel combin select electrochem biosensor possibl simultan verifi degrad condit paper artwork effici clean monitor process remov pollut degrad product paper focu specif exampl techniqu appli paper artwork illustr advantag potenti biotechnolog compar tradit method current use combin hydrogel electrochem biosensor determin extent degrad paper artwork
337,A two-layer diffusive model for describing the variability of transdermal drug permeation.,"There is mounting evidence that the permeability coefficients (k(p)) that describe any given transdermal drug permeation process generally follow some form of positively skewed, non-symmetrical distribution rather than a simple normal distribution. Yet a suitable theoretical treatment of this area has not been undertaken to date. In this paper, we describe a two-layer model that can explain five drugs'k(p) variabilities as measured in two previously published papers. The model shows why rapidly permeating drugs would tend to exhibit more symmetrical k(p) distributions while progressively more slowly permeating drugs would tend to exhibit progressively more positively skewed k(p) distributions. Future research should take this effect into account when comparing the flux variabilities of hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs.",no keywords,European Journal Of Pharmaceutics And Biopharmaceutics : Official Journal Of Arbeitsgemeinschaft Fur Pharmazeutische Verfahrenstechnik E.V,mount evid permeabl coeffici k p describ given transderm drug permeat process gener follow form posit skew distribut rather simpl normal distribut yet suitabl theoret treatment area undertaken date paper describ model explain five drug k p variabl measur two previous publish paper model show rapidli permeat drug would tend exhibit symmetr k p distribut progress slowli permeat drug would tend exhibit progress posit skew k p distribut futur research take effect account compar flux variabl hydrophil lipophil drug diffus model describ variabl transderm drug permeat

341,Shape Matters: A Neglected Feature of Medication Safety : Why Regulating the Shape of Medication Containers Can Improve Medication Safety.,"This paper aims to highlight how to reduce medication errors through the implementation of human factors science to the design features of medication containers. Despite efforts to employ automation for increased safety and decreased workload, medication administration in hospital wards is still heavily dependent on human operators (pharmacists, nurses, physicians, etc.). Improving this multi-step process requires its being studied and designed as an interface in a complex socio-technical system. Human factors engineering, also known as ergonomics, involves designing socio-technical systems to improve overall system performance, and reduces the risk of system, and in particular, operator, failures. The incorporation of human factors principles into the design of the work environment and tools that are in use during medication administration could improve this process. During periods of high workload, the cognitive effort necessary to work through a very demanding process may overwhelm even expert operators. In such conditions, the entire system should facilitate the human operator's high level of performance. Regarding medications, clinicians should be provided with as many perceptual cues as possible to facilitate medication identification. Neglecting the shape of the container as one of the features that differentiates between classes of medications is a lost opportunity to use a helpful characteristic, and medication administration failures that happen in the absence of such intentional design arise from ""designer error"" rather than ""user error"". Guidelines that define a container's shape for each class of medication would compel pharmaceutical manufacturers to be compatible and would eliminate the confusion that arises when a hospital changes the supplier of a given medication.","human factors, medication safety, patient safety, safety management, workload",Journal Of Medical Systems,paper aim highlight reduc medic error implement human factor scienc design featur medic contain despit effort employ autom increas safeti decreas workload medic administr hospit ward still heavili depend human oper pharmacist nurs physician improv process requir studi design interfac complex system human factor engin also known ergonom involv design system improv overal system perform reduc risk system particular oper failur incorpor human factor principl design work environ tool use medic administr could improv process period high workload cognit effort necessari work demand process may overwhelm even expert oper condit entir system facilit human oper high level perform regard medic clinician provid mani perceptu cue possibl facilit medic identif neglect shape contain one featur differenti class medic lost opportun use help characterist medic administr failur happen absenc intent design aris design error rather user error guidelin defin contain shape class medic would compel pharmaceut manufactur compat would elimin confus aris hospit chang supplier given medic shape matter neglect featur medic safeti regul shape medic contain improv medic safeti

343,"Forensic investigation of K2, Spice, and ""bath salt"" commercial preparations: a three-year study of new designer drug products containing synthetic cannabinoid, stimulant, and hallucinogenic compounds.","New designer drugs such as K2, Spice, and ""bath salts"" present a formidable challenge for law enforcement and public health officials. The following report summarizes a three-year study of 1320 law enforcement cases involving over 3000 products described as vegetable material, powders, capsules, tablets, blotter paper, or drug paraphernalia. All items were seized in Arkansas from January 2010 through December 2012 and submitted to the Arkansas State Crime Laboratory for analysis. The geographical distribution of these seizures co-localized in areas with higher population, colleges, and universities. Validated forensic testing procedures confirmed the presence of 26 synthetic cannabinoids, 12 designer stimulants, and 5 hallucinogenic-like drugs regulated by the Synthetic Drug Prevention Act of 2012 and other state statutes. Analysis of paraphernalia suggests that these drugs are commonly used concomitantly with other drugs of abuse including marijuana, MDMA, and methamphetamine. Exact designer drug compositions were unpredictable and often formulated with multiple agents, but overall, the synthetic cannabinoids were significantly more prevalent than all the other designer drugs detected. The synthetic cannabinoids JWH-018, AM2201, JWH-122, JWH-210, and XLR11 were most commonly detected in green vegetable material and powder products. The designer stimulants methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV), 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylcathinone (methylone), and α-methylamino-valerophenone (pentedrone) were commonly detected in tablets, capsules, and powders. Hallucinogenic drugs were rarely detected, but generally found on blotter paper products.

Herein, the lightweight, hydrophobic and porous carbon aerogels (CAs) have been synthesized through freezing-drying and post-pyrolysis by using waste newspaper as the only raw materials. The as-prepared CAs exhibited a low density of 18.5 mg cm(-3) and excellent hydrophobicity with a water contact angle of 132° and selective absorption for organic reagents. The absorption capacity of CA for organic compounds can be 29-51 times its own weight. Moreover, three methods (e.g., squeezing, combustion, and distillation) can be employed to recycle CA and harvest organic pollutants. Combined with waste biomass as raw materials, green and facile fabrication process, excellent hydrophobicity and oleophilicity, CA used as an absorbent material has great potential in application of organic pollutant solvents absorption and environmental protection.","absorption, carbon aerogel, hydrophobicity, recyclability, waste biomass",Carbohydrate Polymers,aerogel fabric wast biomass potenti absorb materi solv organ pollut herein lightweight hydrophob porou carbon aerogel ca synthes use wast newspap raw materi ca exhibit low densiti mg cm excel hydrophob water contact angl select absorpt organ reagent absorpt capac ca organ compound time weight moreov three method squeez combust distil employ recycl ca harvest organ pollut combin wast biomass raw materi green facil fabric process excel hydrophob oleophil ca use absorb materi great potenti applic organ pollut solvent absorpt environment protect green facil fabric carbon aerogel wast newspap solv organ pollut

347,Evaluation of the enantioselectivity of carbon nanoparticles-modified chiral separation systems using dextrin as chiral selector by capillary electrokinetic chromatography.,"Nanoparticles (NPs) can be used as pseudostationary phases (PSPs) in EKC, which is similar to the use of micelle additives as applied in MEKC. To date, the use of NPs to enhance enantiomeric separation by EKC with β-CD or its derivative as chiral selector has been reported only in two papers. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no prior effort to use NPs for achieving enantioseparation with polysaccharides as chiral selector. This paper describes for the first time the use of carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) as PSPs to modify chiral separation system employing dextrin as chiral selector for the enantioseparations of several basic drugs in capillary EKC. Three different types of CNPs, including carbogenic nanoparticles (NPs), carboxylated single-walled carbon nanotubes, and carboxylated multiwalled carbon nanotubes, were used as running buffer additives, respectively. The potential of the PSPs and the effects of dextrin concentration, buffer pH, and buffer concentration on the enantioseparations were evaluated. Four pairs of tested enantiomers were successfully resolved in less than 15 min with the resolution values in the range of 1.41-4.52 under optimized conditions. Compared to the buffer without NPs, the introduction of NPs into the buffer enhanced the separation of the enantiomers.","capillary ekc, carbon nanoparticles, dextrin, enantioseparation, pseudo-stationary phase",Electrophoresis,nanoparticl np use pseudostationari phase psp ekc similar use micel addit appli mekc date use np enhanc enantiomer separ ekc deriv chiral selector report two paper howev best knowledg prior effort use np achiev enantiosepar polysaccharid chiral selector paper describ first time use carbon nanoparticl cnp psp modifi chiral separ system employ dextrin chiral selector enantiosepar sever basic drug capillari ekc three differ type cnp includ carbogen nanoparticl np carboxyl carbon nanotub carboxyl multiwal carbon nanotub use run buffer addit respect potenti psp effect dextrin concentr buffer ph buffer concentr enantiosepar evalu four pair test enantiom success resolv less min resolut valu rang optim condit compar buffer without np introduct np buffer enhanc separ enantiom evalu enantioselect carbon chiral separ system use dextrin chiral selector capillari electrokinet chromatographi

349,High-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in the identification and determination of phase I and phase II drug metabolites.,"Applications of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) techniques coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in the identification and determination of phase I and phase II drug metabolites are reviewed with an emphasis on recent papers published predominantly within the last 6 years (2002-2007) reporting the employment of atmospheric pressure ionization techniques as the most promising approach for a sensitive detection, positive identification and quantitation of metabolites in complex biological matrices. This review is devoted to in vitro and in vivo drug biotransformation in humans and animals. The first step preceding an HPLC-MS bioanalysis consists in the choice of suitable sample preparation procedures (biomatrix sampling, homogenization, internal standard addition, deproteination, centrifugation, extraction). The subsequent step is the right optimization of chromatographic conditions providing the required separation selectivity, analysis time and also good compatibility with the MS detection. This is usually not accessible without the employment of the parent drug and synthesized or isolated chemical standards of expected phase I and sometimes also phase II metabolites. The incorporation of additional detectors (photodiode-array UV, fluorescence, polarimetric and others) between the HPLC and MS instruments can result in valuable analytical information supplementing MS results. The relation among the structural changes caused by metabolic reactions and corresponding shifts in the retention behavior in reversed-phase systems is discussed as supporting information for identification of the metabolite. The first and basic step in the interpretation of mass spectra is always the molecular weight (MW) determination based on the presence of protonated molecules [M+H](+) and sometimes adducts with ammonium or alkali-metal ions, observed in the positive-ion full-scan mass spectra. The MW determination can be confirmed by the [M-H](-) ion for metabolites providing a signal in negative-ion mass spectra. MS/MS is a worthy tool for further structural characterization because of the occurrence of characteristic fragment ions, either MS( n ) analysis for studying the fragmentation patterns using trap-based analyzers or high mass accuracy measurements for elemental composition determination using time of flight based or Fourier transform mass analyzers. The correlation between typical functional groups found in phase I and phase II drug metabolites and corresponding neutral losses is generalized and illustrated for selected examples. The choice of a suitable ionization technique and polarity mode in relation to the metabolite structure is discussed as well.",no keywords,Analytical And Bioanalytical Chemistry,applic tandem mass spectrometri techniqu coupl liquid chromatographi hplc identif determin phase phase ii drug metabolit review emphasi recent paper publish predominantli within last year report employ atmospher pressur ioniz techniqu promis approach sensit detect posit identif quantit metabolit complex biolog matric review devot vitro vivo drug biotransform human anim first step preced bioanalysi consist choic suitabl sampl prepar procedur biomatrix sampl homogen intern standard addit deprotein centrifug extract subsequ step right optim chromatograph condit provid requir separ select analysi time also good compat m detect usual access without employ parent drug synthes isol chemic standard expect phase sometim also phase ii metabolit incorpor addit detector uv fluoresc polarimetr other hplc m instrument result valuabl analyt inform supplement m result relat among structur chang caus metabol reaction correspond shift retent behavior system discus support inform identif metabolit first basic step interpret mass spectrum alway molecular weight mw determin base presenc proton molecul sometim adduct ammonium ion observ mass spectrum mw determin confirm ion metabolit provid signal mass spectrum worthi tool structur character occurr characterist fragment ion either m n analysi studi fragment pattern use analyz high mass accuraci measur element composit determin use time flight base fourier transform mass analyz correl typic function group found phase phase ii drug metabolit correspond neutral loss gener illustr select exampl choic suitabl ioniz techniqu polar mode relat metabolit structur discus well liquid mass spectrometri identif determin phase phase ii drug metabolit
350,Degraders early developability assessment: face-to-face with molecular properties.,"Pharmaceutical scientists have huge expectations from heterobifunctional small molecule degraders to treat diseases with an unmet medical need. However, degraders are large and flexible and pose significant challenges in terms of cellular uptake and bioavailability. An efficient property-based design is therefore required to discover new oral degrader medicines. Here, we show the non‑transferability to degraders of in silico tools routinely implemented in small molecule drug discovery programs; and provide ionization, lipophilicity, polarity and chameleonicity data for a series of seven degraders. We also reveal that permeability can be modeled by Δlog k<sub>W</sub><sup>IAM</sup> - an experimental polarity descriptor.

351,"Exploring paediatric oral suspension development: Challenges, requirements, and formulation advancements.","Oral suspension is the most preferred dosage form for the paediatric population because of the difficulties related to solid medications, such as the swallowing limitations, bitter taste, and poor oral bioavailability, which can cause serious impairment to attain a successful treatment. Given the importance of successful therapies, there is a need for safe and effective commercially-available paediatric oral suspension and their characterization. For the latter, it is important to identify safe excipients and preservatives. The paediatric group is a diverse category which includes infants and teenagers, with major pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics differences, mainly because of physiological and behavioral variations. Therefore, finding a single formulation for paediatric population remains a challenge, as well asthe formulation of stable-in-time suspension. In addition, drug's dissolving characteristic and permeation, are the main determinants for oral absorption, which are closely related to drug release kinetics from the pharmaceutical form. In this context, drug release profile is an important and limiting step in oral bioavailability, particularly for BCS class II drugs; thus, it is possible to increase bioavailability and minimize adverse effects by changing the release rate of such drugs. This review covers all the aspects for paediatric oral suspension development, and analyses the considerations for excipients selection as a crucial task for effectively choosing a safe and effective pharmaceutical form and correctly dosing paediatric patients.","challenges, drug selection criteria, excipient selection, latest advancement, paediatric oral suspension",International Journal Of Pharmaceutics,oral suspens prefer dosag form paediatr popul difficulti relat solid medic swallow limit bitter tast poor oral bioavail caus seriou impair attain success treatment given import success therapi need safe effect paediatr oral suspens character latter import identifi safe excipi preserv paediatr group diver categori includ infant teenag major pharmacokinet pharmacodynam differ mainli physiolog behavior variat therefor find singl formul paediatr popul remain challeng well asth formul suspens addit drug dissolv characterist permeat main determin oral absorpt close relat drug releas kinet pharmaceut form context drug releas profil import limit step oral bioavail particularli bc class ii drug thu possibl increas bioavail minim advers effect chang releas rate drug review cover aspect paediatr oral suspens develop analys consider excipi select crucial task effect choos safe effect pharmaceut form correctli dose paediatr patient explor paediatr oral suspens develop challeng requir formul advanc
352,Biodegradation of pharmaceuticals in photobioreactors - a systematic literature review.,"This work is a systematic review that reports state-of-the-art in removal of pharmaceuticals from water and wastewater by photosynthetic organisms in photobioreactors. The PRISMA protocol-based review of the most recent literature data from the last 10 years (2011-2021) was reported. Articles were searched by the combination of the following keywords: photobioreactor, pharmaceuticals, drugs, hormones, antibiotics, biodegradation, removal, wastewater treatment. The review focuses on original research papers (not reviews), collected in 3 scientific databases: Scopus, Web of Knowledge, PubMed. The review considered the following factors: type of microorganisms, type of micropollutants removed, degradation efficiency and associated products, types of photosynthetic organisms and photobioreactor types. The conclusion from the systematic review is that the main factors that limit widespread pharmaceuticals removal in photobioreactors are high costs and the problem of low efficiency related with low concentrations of pharmaceuticals. The review indicated a need for further research in this area due to increasing amounts of metabolites in the food chain, such as p-aminophenol and estrone, which can cause harm to people and ichthyofauna. Pharmaceuticals removal can be improved by adapting the type of microorganism used to the type of contamination and implementing photoperiods, which increase the removal efficiency of e.g. sulfamethazine by up to 28%. In the future, it is necessary to search for new solutions in terms of the construction of photobioreactors, as well as for more effective species in terms of pharmaceuticals biodegradation that can survive the competition with other strains during water and wastewater treatment.","algae, biodegradation, micropollutants, pharmaceuticals, photodegradation, wastewater treatment",Bioengineered,work systemat review report remov pharmaceut water wastewat photosynthet organ photobioreactor prisma review recent literatur data last year report articl search combin follow keyword photobioreactor pharmaceut drug hormon antibiot biodegrad remov wastewat treatment review focus origin research paper review collect scientif databas scopu web knowledg pubm review consid follow factor type microorgan type micropollut remov degrad effici associ product type photosynthet organ photobioreactor type conclus systemat review main factor limit widespread pharmaceut remov photobioreactor high cost problem low effici relat low concentr pharmaceut review indic need research area due increas amount metabolit food chain estron caus harm peopl ichthyofauna pharmaceut remov improv adapt type microorgan use type contamin implement photoperiod increas remov effici sulfamethazin futur necessari search new solut term construct photobioreactor well effect speci term pharmaceut biodegrad surviv competit strain water wastewat treatment biodegrad pharmaceut photobioreactor systemat literatur review
353,Double-injection capillary electrophoresis for the identification of analytes.,"This paper presents a new approach for identifying analytes by CE. The compound to be identified is analyzed together with the corresponding reference standard during a double injection capillary electrophoretic run. The inter-plug distance is regulated by applying an electrical field over the capillary for a predetermined time period (t(PE)). The migration time of an analyte being exposed to the partial electrophoresis was calculated from the partial migration time (t(mig(p))) as described in this paper. The identification is based on the closeness of agreement between the calculated migration time (t(mig(c))) and observed migration time (t(mig)) of the reference standard. The validity of the derived equations was checked by analyzing several substances such as caffeine, melamine, acetyl salicylic acid, paracetamol, ibuprofen, metoprolol, naproxen, somatropin, several insulin analogs, as well as different pharmaceutical and natural products. The migration time ratios for the identified solutes varied between 0.996 and 1.006 (i.e., 1.001 ± 0.005), indicating good agreement between the observed and calculated migration times.","double-injection mode, identification, partial migration time",Electrophoresis,paper present new approach identifi analyt ce compound identifi analyz togeth correspond refer standard doubl inject capillari electrophoret run distanc regul appli electr field capillari predetermin time period pe migrat time analyt expo partial electrophoresi calcul partial migrat time mig p describ paper identif base close agreement calcul migrat time mig c observ migrat time mig refer standard valid deriv equat check analyz sever substanc caffein melamin acetyl salicyl acid paracetamol ibuprofen metoprolol naproxen somatropin sever insulin analog well differ pharmaceut natur product migrat time ratio identifi solut vari indic good agreement observ calcul migrat time capillari electrophoresi identif analyt

We found that the antibody and the DNA aptamer retained their recognition capabilities when coupled to microgel. The printed microgel remains stationary during chromatographic elution while the microgel-supported molecular recognition elements are accessible to their intended targets present in the elution solution.

356,"Hydrostability, mechanical resilience, and biodegradability of paper straws fabricated through lignin-based polyurethane and chitosan binary emulsion bonding.","This study focuses on enhancing the strength and water stability of paper straws through a novel approach involving a binary emulsion of lignin-based polyurethane and chitosan. Kraft lignin serves as the raw material for synthesizing a blocked waterborne polyurethane, subsequently combined with carboxylated chitosan to form a stable binary emulsion. The resulting emulsion, exhibiting remarkable stability over at least 6 months, is applied to the base paper. Following emulsion application, the paper undergoes torrefaction at 155 °C. This process deblocks isocyanate groups, enabling their reaction with hydroxyl groups on chitosan and fibers, ultimately forming ester bonds. This reaction significantly improves the mechanical strength and hydrophobicity of paper straws. The composite paper straws demonstrate exceptional mechanical properties, including a tensile strength of 47.21 MPa, Young's modulus of 4.33 GPa, and flexural strength of 32.38 MPa. Notably, its water stability is greatly enhanced, with a wet tensile strength of 40.66 MPa, surpassing commercial paper straws by 8 folds. Furthermore, the composite straw achieves complete biodegradability within 120 days, outperforming conventional paper straws in terms of environmental impact. This innovative solution presents a promising and sustainable alternative to plastic straws, addressing the urgent need for eco-friendly products.","chitosan, lignin, paper straw, polyurethane, water stability",International Journal Of Biological Macromolecules,studi focus enhanc strength water stabil paper straw novel approach involv binari emuls polyurethan chitosan kraft lignin serv raw materi synthes block waterborn polyurethan subsequ combin carboxyl chitosan form stabl binari emuls result emuls exhibit remark stabil least month appli base paper follow emuls applic paper undergo torrefact process deblock isocyan group enabl reaction hydroxyl group chitosan fiber ultim form ester bond reaction significantli improv mechan strength hydrophob paper straw composit paper straw demonstr except mechan properti includ tensil strength mpa young modulu gpa flexur strength mpa notabl water stabil greatli enhanc wet tensil strength mpa surpass commerci paper straw fold furthermor composit straw achiev complet biodegrad within day outperform convent paper straw term environment impact innov solut present promis sustain altern plastic straw address urgent need product hydrost mechan resili biodegrad paper straw fabric polyurethan chitosan binari emuls bond

The difference in pharmacokinetic profiles calculated by the valid and the commonly used equations could be quite significant, particularly due to contribution of the organs with relatively large perfusion volume, and especially for drugs with small tissue-plasma partition coefficient and high blood-plasma concentration ratio. Application of the valid equation may result in much faster initial drop of drug plasma concentration time curve and significantly longer terminal half-life, especially for low extraction ratio drugs.

359,The Drug Shortage Era: A Scoping Review of the Literature 2001-2019.,"Drug shortages continue at crisis levels in the United States, with no end in sight. Extensive research in disparate areas has been conducted to explore the impact that shortages have on patients and the healthcare system. We conducted a scoping review to categorize existing work in order to identify opportunities for further research. We considered peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed articles involving non-vaccine, human drug shortages in the United States published in English between January 2001 and May 2019. In total, 430 papers were charted according to the following categories: causes, impacts on care, health outcomes, costs, management, prevention, and federal government response. Of these, 112 papers considered causes; 199 discussed effects, 158 considered management strategies, and 140 discussed prevention. We provide a resource to navigate the vast literature on drug shortages in the United States, identifying areas in need of further research. This review highlights the widespread negative effects that drug shortages have on patients, providers, and health system costs in the United States. Evidence of their ramifications should be sufficient to justify policy change.

360,Paper-Based Analytical Device for the On-Site Detection of Nerve Agents.,"We report a colorimetric paper-based microfluidic device based on an enzyme inhibition assay that allows the on-site detection of nerve agents by sampling and wicking. The sample and reagents are automatically transported through the channel where an enzyme inhibition reaction is conducted, followed by an enzyme-substrate reaction and a color reaction. This device can detect 0.1 μg/mL of the nerve agent VX in a 2.5 μL drop and is nerve agent selective and robust against temperature, pH, and several liquids. We confirmed that sampling procedures (dilution and wiping) are applicable to this device. Furthermore, the fabrication procedure is easy, and the cost is at most a few tens of cents. Thus, the present device provides a practical method for the urgent detection of nerve agents in suspected chemical terrorism incidents.","acetylcholine esterase, colorimetry, nerve agent, ph, paper-based device",Acs Applied Bio Materials,report colorimetr microfluid devic base enzym inhibit assay allow detect nerv agent sampl wick sampl reagent automat transport channel enzym inhibit reaction conduct follow reaction color reaction devic detect nerv agent vx μl drop nerv agent select robust temperatur ph sever liquid confirm sampl procedur dilut wipe applic devic furthermor fabric procedur easi cost ten cent thu present devic provid practic method urgent detect nerv agent suspect chemic terror incid analyt devic detect nerv agent
361,Inkjet Printing Patterned Plasmonic SERS Platform with Surface-Optimized Paper for Label-Free Detection of Illegal Drugs in Urine.,"Rapid quantitative testing of illegal drugs is urgently needed for precisely cracking down on drug crimes. Herein, an optimized paper-based surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) platform with patterned printing of plasmonic nanoparticles was constructed for the on-site quick testing of illegal drugs in urine. The filter paper was first coated with a layer of positive-charged chitosan, so as to reduce its roughness by filling the holes of the cellulose matrix and enhance the adhesion of negative-charged silver ink. Subsequently, hydrophobic modification was performed based on the binary silylation reaction, which could obviously improve the sensitivity of the paper-based SERS substrate by concentrating the amount of analyte. Meanwhile, SERS-active silver ink was fabricated and further printed on the surface of the above modified paper with custom-designed pattern (3 × 6). The performance of this SERS platform was assessed by using crystal violet (CV) as a model tag, and the obtained results proved it possesses excellent sensitivity and reproducibility, in which the relative standard deviation (RSD) dropped remarkably. More importantly, as a proof of concept, rapid detection of standard methylamphetamine (MAMP), one of the most widely abused drugs, was achieved with a limit of detection (LOD) of 1.43 ppb using a portable Raman spectrometer. And it also had a good capability in human urine sample detection, with a correlation index (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup>) up to 0.9927.

362,EASI-IMS an expedite and secure technique to screen for 25I-NBOH in blotter papers.,"The increasing number of new psychoactive substances (NPS) and their quick worldwide spreading, often only slightly modified in the form of new derivatives and analogues, have brought the need for fast, wide-ranging, and unequivocal identification methods in clinical and forensic investigations. Because it usually provides secure results, gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) has been routinely employed as the standard technique for the detection of NPS in blotter papers. For 25I-NBOH (N-(2-hydroxybenzyl)-2-(4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)ethan-1-aminium), however, GC-MS analysis of an blotter paper extract leads to incorrect results. In this work, we investigated whether easy ambient sonic-spray mass spectrometry imaging (EASI-IMS), and ambient ionization MS method can be applied directly to the surface of the sample requiring therefore no extraction or sample preparations, would serve as an efficient, sensitive, and secure alternative for 25I-NBOH screening.","25i-nboh, easi, nps, blotter papers, forensic chemistry, phenethylamine derivatives",Journal Of Mass Spectrometry : Jms,increas number new psychoact substanc np quick worldwid spread often slightli modifi form new deriv analogu brought need fast unequivoc identif method clinic forens investig usual provid secur result ga chromatographi coupl mass spectrometri routin employ standard techniqu detect np blotter paper howev analysi blotter paper extract lead incorrect result work investig whether easi ambient mass spectrometri imag ambient ioniz m method appli directli surfac sampl requir therefor extract sampl prepar would serv effici sensit secur altern screen expedit secur techniqu screen blotter paper

Compared with conventional UV absorbance detection used in HPLC, fluorescence detection can greatly enhance the sensitivity leading to limits of detection similar to those obtained with mass spectrometry, offering researchers a sensitive, robust and relatively inexpensive instrumental method. This work will focus on the analysis of pharmaceutical compounds in different biological matrices, either naturally fluorescent or derivatized with a fluorescent agent, and some of them chiral.

364,Role of liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HR/MS) in clinical toxicology.,"Gas chromatography (GC) and liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) are widely used to confirm drug screening results and for urine screening in presumed intoxicated patients. These techniques are better suited to targeted analysis than to general unknown screening and, due to the complexity of testing, results are seldom available rapidly enough to contribute to the immediate care of the patient. High resolution (HR)/MS with time-of-flight (TOF) or orbitrap instruments offer potential advantages in clinical toxicology. COMPARISON OF GC-MS, LC-MS/MS AND LC-HR/MS: For unknown analyses, GC-MS and LC-MS/MS require comparison of full-scan spectra against preestablished libraries. Operation in full-scan mode greatly reduces sensitivity and some drugs present in low but significant concentrations may be missed. Selected ion monitoring (SIM) in GC/MS and selected reaction monitoring (SRM) in LC-MS/MS, where only targeted ions are monitored, increase sensitivity but require prior knowledge of what compound is to be measured. LC-HR/MS offers mass assignment with an accuracy of 0.001 atomic mass units (amu) compared with 1 amu in conventional MS. Tentative identification is thus directed to a very limited set of compounds (or even one unique compound) based on the exact molecular formula rather than a fragmentation pattern, since HR/MS can discriminate between compounds with the same nominal molecular mass. LC-MS/MS has clear advantages over GC/MS in ease and speed of sample preparation and the opportunities for its automation. LC-HR/MS is more suitable to clinical toxicology because the drugs present in a sample are rarely known a priori, and tentative identifications of unknowns can be made without the availability of a reference standard or a library spectrum. Blood can be used in preference to urine which is more relevant to the patient's current clinical situation.",no keywords,"Clinical Toxicology (Philadelphia, Pa.)",ga chromatographi gc liquid chromatographi lc coupl mass spectrometri m wide use confirm drug screen result urin screen presum intox patient techniqu better suit target analysi gener unknown screen due complex test result seldom avail rapidli enough contribut immedi care patient high resolut hr tof orbitrap instrument offer potenti advantag clinic toxicolog comparison unknown analys requir comparison spectrum preestablish librari oper mode greatli reduc sensit drug present low signific concentr may miss select ion monitor sim select reaction monitor srm target ion monitor increas sensit requir prior knowledg compound measur offer mass assign accuraci atom mass unit amu compar amu convent tent identif thu direct limit set compound even one uniqu compound base exact molecular formula rather fragment pattern sinc discrimin compound nomin molecular mass clear advantag ea speed sampl prepar opportun autom suitabl clinic toxicolog drug present sampl rare known priori tent identif unknown made without avail refer standard librari spectrum blood use prefer urin relev patient current clinic situat role liquid mass spectrometri clinic toxicolog
365,Paper-based Electrochemical Sensor Integrated with Gold Nanoparticle-Decorated Carbon Cloth as a Working Electrode for Nitric Oxide Detection in Artificial Tears.,"Nitric oxide (NO) in human tears regulates numerous ocular surface processes, such as tear generation, corneal wound healing, conjunctival vascular tone, and so forth. Any deviation from its normal concentration is linked to various ocular syndromes, including microbial keratitis, conjunctivitis, pterygium, dry eye, retinitis, glaucoma, and so forth. Therefore, precise monitoring of NO in tears can be considered as a potential biomarker for ocular diseases. Here, we report a highly sensitive and selective electrochemical NO sensor using carbon ink-based electrodes. Counter, working (WE), and reference electrodes have been designed and painted on a butter paper by using carbon ink. To improve the sensing performance, the WE has been modified with a gold nanoparticle (Au NP)-deposited carbon cloth (CC). Such a paper-based sensor demonstrated high sensitivity of ∼0.34 μA μM<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup>, ultralow detection limit of ∼2.35 nM, wide linear range of 10 nM-0.4 mM, and fast response time (0.35 s). The sensor also showed excellent stability and selectivity toward the interfering agents in human body fluids. Such a low-cost, flexible paper-based sensor was employed for the detection of NO in artificial tears.","artificial tears, carbon cloth, carbon ink, electrochemical sensor, gold nanoparticles, paper-based electrode",Acs Applied Bio Materials,nitric oxid human tear regul numer ocular surfac process tear gener corneal wound heal conjunctiv vascular tone forth deviat normal concentr link variou ocular syndrom includ microbi kerat conjunct pterygium dri eye retin glaucoma forth therefor precis monitor tear consid potenti biomark ocular diseas report highli sensit select electrochem sensor use carbon electrod counter work refer electrod design paint butter paper use carbon ink improv sen perform modifi gold nanoparticl au np carbon cloth cc sensor demonstr high sensit μa μm sup cm sup ultralow detect limit nm wide linear rang mm fast respons time sensor also show excel stabil select toward interf agent human bodi fluid flexibl sensor employ detect artifici tear electrochem sensor integr gold carbon cloth work electrod nitric oxid detect artifici tear

The test can be done within minutes, and allows for a semi-quantitative analysis of the artesunate tablets by comparing the developed yellow color on the paper test to a color-coded key chart that comes with the kit. A more accurate and precise analysis is done by utilizing a color analyzer on an iPhone camera that measures the color intensity of the developed color on the paper chip. A digital image of the chip was taken and analyzed by measuring the average gray intensity of the color developed on the paper circle. A plot of the artesunate concentration versus the average gray scale intensity was generated. Results show that the intensity of the yellow color developed on the paper test was consistent and proportional to the amount of artesunate present in the sample. With artesunate concentrations ranging from 0.0 to 20mg/mL, a linear calibration plot was obtained with a detection limit of 0.98 mg/mL.","artesunate, colorimetric assay, fabrication, malaria, paper microfluidics",Talanta,emerg artesun antimalari counterfeit southeast asia africa present product rapid inexpens simpl test kit detect counterfeit artesun order preserv life prevent develop resist malaria kit work base paper microfluid offer sever advantag convent microfluid great potenti gener inexpens rapid dispos diagnost devic develop colorimetr assay specif artesun turn yellow upon addit sampl test done within minut allow analysi artesun tablet compar develop yellow color paper test key chart come kit accur precis analysi done util color analyz iphon camera measur color intens develop color paper chip digit imag chip taken analyz measur averag gray intens color develop paper circl plot artesun concentr versu averag gray scale intens gener result show intens yellow color develop paper test consist proport amount artesun present sampl artesun concentr rang linear calibr plot obtain detect limit identif counterfeit antimalari drug paper

370,Paper-based SERS substrate and one-class classifier to monitor thiabendazole residual levels in extracts of mango peels.,"The assessment of pesticide residue levels demands fast, low cost and easy-to-use procedures which are not found in conventional methods. In this work, SERS substrates based on the deposition of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) on common office paper were prepared using a wax printer. These substrates combined with Data Driven Soft Independent Modelling of Class Analogies (DD-SIMCA), a one-class classifier algorithm, were used for detection of pesticide residues in water extracts of mango peels. Paper-based substrates made sample collection easier compared with conventional SERS methods, since few microliters of the pesticide aqueous extract from fruit peels needed to be deposited onto the substrate. Moreover, one-class classifiers dismiss the need for quantification or calibration curves. Classification of a fruit with residue levels in accordance to regulatory bodies' limits is based on a mathematical threshold. Just as in an authentication problem, all the possibilities for a given analysed fruit are now restricted to agreeing or not agreeing with current regulations. The performance of the one-class model was demonstrated by detecting thiabendazole (TBZ) residues at various mango samples, with all results being confirmed by HPLC-DAD analysis. The final model could distinguish samples with TBZ levels above the ones allowed by the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency with 94% of selectivity and 92% of sensitivity, even in the presence of other pesticides.","dd-simca, mango, paper-based sers, pesticide, thiabendazole","Spectrochimica Acta.

371,Dose Predictions for Drug Design.,"The efficacious dose of a drug is perhaps the most holistic metric reflecting its therapeutic potential. Dose is predicted at many stages in drug discovery and development. Prior to the 1990s, dose prediction was limited to the drug ""working"" at a reasonable dose and dose regimen in an animal model. Through the early 2000s, dose predictions were generated at candidate nomination and then refined during clinical development. Currently, dose predictions can be made early in drug discovery to enable drug design. Dose predictions at this stage can identify critical drug properties for a viable dose regimen and provide clinically relevant context to lead optimization. In this paper, we give an overview of the opportunities and challenges associated with dose prediction for drug design. A number of general considerations, approaches, and case examples are discussed.",no keywords,Journal Of Medicinal Chemistry,efficaci dose drug perhap holist metric reflect therapeut potenti dose predict mani stage drug discoveri develop prior dose predict limit drug work reason dose dose regimen anim model earli dose predict gener candid nomin refin clinic develop current dose predict made earli drug discoveri enabl drug design dose predict stage identifi critic drug properti viabl dose regimen provid clinic relev context lead optim paper give overview opportun challeng associ dose predict drug design number gener consider approach case exampl discus dose predict drug design

It has a wide application in various areas and has been extensively studied. This review paper aims to discuss computational modeling of a fluidized bed with a focus on pharmaceutical applications. Eulerian, Lagrangian, and combined Eulerian-Lagrangian models have been studied for fluid bed applications with the rise of modeling capabilities. Such models assist in optimizing the process parameters and expedite the process development cycle.

374,Overall impact of the regulatory requirements for genotoxic impurities on the drug development process.,"In the last decade a considerable effort has been made both by the regulators and the pharmaceutical industry to assess genotoxic impurities (GTI) in pharmaceutical products. Though the control of impurities in drug substances and products is a well established and consolidated procedure, its extension to GTI has given rise to a number of problems, both in terms of setting the limits and detecting these impurities in pharmaceutical products. Several papers have dealt with this issue, discussing available regulations, providing strategies to evaluate the genotoxic potential of chemical substances, and trying to address the analytical challenge of detecting GTI at trace levels. In this review we would like to discuss the available regulations, the toxicological background for establishing limits, as well as the analytical approaches used for GTI assessment. The final aim is that of providing a complete overview of the topic with updated available information, to address the overall GTI issue during the development of new drug substances.",no keywords,European Journal Of Pharmaceutical Sciences : Official Journal Of The European Federation For Pharmaceutical Sciences,last decad consider effort made regul pharmaceut industri assess genotox impur gti pharmaceut product though control impur drug substanc product well establish consolid procedur extens gti given rise number problem term set limit detect impur pharmaceut product sever paper dealt issu discus avail regul provid strategi evalu genotox potenti chemic substanc tri address analyt challeng detect gti trace level review would like discus avail regul toxicolog background establish limit well analyt approach use gti assess final aim provid complet overview topic updat avail inform address overal gti issu develop new drug substanc overal impact regulatori requir genotox impur drug develop process
375,Kinetics of drug action in disease states: towards physiology-based pharmacodynamic (PBPD) models.,"Gerhard Levy started his investigations on the ""Kinetics of Drug Action in Disease States"" in the fall of 1980. The objective of his research was to study inter-individual variation in pharmacodynamics. To this end, theoretical concepts and experimental approaches were introduced, which enabled assessment of the changes in pharmacodynamics per se, while excluding or accounting for the cofounding effects of concomitant changes in pharmacokinetics. These concepts were applied in several studies. The results, which were published in 45 papers in the years 1984-1994, showed considerable variation in pharmacodynamics. These initial studies on kinetics of drug action in disease states triggered further experimental research on the relations between pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Together with the concepts in Levy's earlier publications ""Kinetics of Pharmacologic Effects"" (Clin Pharmacol Ther 7(3): 362-372, 1966) and ""Kinetics of pharmacologic effects in man: the anticoagulant action of warfarin"" (Clin Pharmacol Ther 10(1): 22-35, 1969), they form a significant impulse to the development of physiology-based pharmacodynamic (PBPD) modeling as novel discipline in the pharmaceutical sciences. This paper reviews Levy's research on the ""Kinetics of Drug Action in Disease States"". Next it addresses the significance of his research for the evolution of PBPD modeling as a scientific discipline. PBPD models contain specific expressions to characterize in a strictly quantitative manner processes on the causal path between exposure (in terms of concentration at the target site) and the drug effect (in terms of the change in biological function). Pertinent processes on the causal path are: (1) target site distribution, (2) target binding and activation and (3) transduction and homeostatic feedback.","biophase distribution, disease systems analysis, dynamical systems analysis, receptor theory",Journal Of Pharmacokinetics And Pharmacodynamics,gerhard levi start investig kinet drug action diseas state fall object research studi variat pharmacodynam end theoret concept experiment approach introduc enabl assess chang pharmacodynam per se exclud account cofound effect concomit chang pharmacokinet concept appli sever studi result publish paper year show consider variat pharmacodynam initi studi kinet drug action diseas state trigger experiment research relat pharmacokinet pharmacodynam togeth concept levi earlier public kinet pharmacolog effect clin pharmacol ther kinet pharmacolog effect man anticoagul action warfarin clin pharmacol ther form signific impuls develop pharmacodynam pbpd model novel disciplin pharmaceut scienc paper review levi research kinet drug action diseas state next address signific research evolut pbpd model scientif disciplin pbpd model contain specif express character strictli quantit manner process causal path exposur term concentr target site drug effect term chang biolog function pertin process causal path target site distribut target bind activ transduct homeostat feedback kinet drug action diseas state toward pharmacodynam pbpd model

380,A sustainable carbon aerogel from waste paper with exceptional performance for antibiotics removal from water.,"In this work, a sustainable 3D carbon aerogel (AO-WPC) is prepared from waste paper (WP), and used for efficient antibiotics removal from water. The AO-WPC aerogel shows good mechanical property and can recover after 100th of 30 % compression strain. The specific surface area of AO-WPC aerogel is up to 654.58 m<sup>2</sup>/g. More importantly, this aerogel reveals proper pore size distribution, including micro sized macropores between carbon fibers and intrinsic nano scale mesopores (11.86 nm), which is conducive to remove antibiotics from water. Taking tetracycline (Tc) as an example, the maximum adsorption capacity and adsorption rate of AO-WPC for Tc are as high as 384.6 mg/g and 0.510 g/(mg‧min), respectively, which exhibits significant advantages over most of the recent absorbents, and the adsorption toward Tc reveals good resistance to various environmental factors, including pH, various ions, and dissolved organic matter (DOM). Moreover, good thermal stability enables the AO-WPC aerogel to be regenerated through simple burning, and the adsorption capacity of Tc only decreases by 10.4 % after 10 cycles. Mechanism research shows that hydrogen bonding and π-π electron-donor-acceptor (EDA) interaction play the important role in the adsorption. The excellent mechanical property and adsorption performance imply good practical prospect of the AO-WPC aerogel.","advanced adsorption, antibiotics pollution, carbon aerogel, excellent compressibility, waste paper",Journal Of Hazardous Materials,work sustain carbon aerogel prepar wast paper wp use effici antibiot remov water aerogel show good mechan properti recov compress strain specif surfac area aerogel sup importantli aerogel reveal proper pore size distribut includ micro size macropor carbon fiber intrins nano scale mesopor nm conduc remov antibiot water take tetracyclin tc exampl maximum adsorpt capac adsorpt rate tc high respect exhibit signific advantag recent absorb adsorpt toward tc reveal good resist variou environment factor includ ph variou ion dissolv organ matter dom moreov good thermal stabil enabl aerogel regener simpl burn adsorpt capac tc decreas cycl mechan research show hydrogen bond eda interact play import role adsorpt excel mechan properti adsorpt perform impli good practic prospect aerogel sustain carbon aerogel wast paper except perform antibiot remov water
381,Paper-based nucleic acid amplification tests for point-of-care diagnostics.,"There has been a recent resurgence in the use of paper as a substrate for developing point-of-care medical diagnostic tests, possibly triggered by expiring patents published in the 1990s. A hallmark of this resurgence has been the development of advanced shapes and structures made from paper to conduct multi-step fluidic operations using the wicking action of porous materials. Such devices indicate a distinct improvement over lateral flow immunoassays, which are restricted to conducting one-step operations. New developments in paper-based diagnostic devices have triggered interest in the development of paper-based point-of-care nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). NAATs can identify extremely low levels of specific nucleic acid sequences from clinical samples and are the most sensitive of all available tests for infectious disease diagnosis. Because traditional PCR-based NAATs require expensive instruments, the development of portable paper-based NAAT's has become an exciting field of research. This article aims to review and analyse the current state of development of paper-based NAATs. We project paper-based NAATs as miniaturized chemical processes and shed light on various schemes of operation used for converting the multiple steps of the chemical processes into paper microfluidic devices. We conclude by elaborating on the challenges that must be overcome in the near future so that progress can be made towards the development of fully functional and commercial paper-based NAATs.",no keywords,The Analyst,recent resurg use paper substrat develop medic diagnost test possibl trigger expir patent publish hallmark resurg develop advanc shape structur made paper conduct fluidic oper use wick action porou materi devic indic distinct improv later flow immunoassay restrict conduct oper new develop diagnost devic trigger interest develop nucleic acid amplif test naat naat identifi extrem low level specif nucleic acid sequenc clinic sampl sensit avail test infecti diseas diagnosi tradit naat requir expens instrument develop portabl naat becom excit field research articl aim review analys current state develop naat project naat miniatur chemic process shed light variou scheme oper use convert multipl step chemic process paper microfluid devic conclud elabor challeng must overcom near futur progress made toward develop fulli function commerci naat nucleic acid amplif test diagnost

Catalyst re-oxidation.,"The re-oxidation capacity of partially reduced heptamolybdo-pentavanado-phosphate polyanion (HPA-5(red) or heteropoly blue) by ozone in water and aqueous acetone solution has been examined under conditions simulating pulp bleaching process. Two oxidation stages/phases were revealed indicating the presence of two reactive states (forms) of catalyst in ozonation solution. The bulk of HPA-5(red) (ca. 90%) was completely recovered within a few first minutes of ozonation ([HPA](red)=0.5 mM; 0.39 mmol O(3)/min), whereas residual catalyst portion reacted very slowly (two orders lower rate) with ozone. Addition of organic solvent was shown to have a favorable effect on HPA-5(red) re-oxidation by ozone (k of 0.29 min(-1) vs. 0.43 min(-1) for ozonation, respectively, in water and 10%v/v acetone solution; pH 2), being evidently the principal reason for high efficiency of solvent-assisted HPA/O(3) pulp bleaching approach.

386,A review of GI conditions critical to oral drug absorption in malnourished children.,Accurate prediction of oral absorption of drugs relies on biorelevant methodology. Current methods are based on Western healthy adult populations. Malnourished children have many differences in their gastrointestinal anatomy and physiology compared to a healthy Western adult. These differences may affect the oral absorption of medicines and it is important to gather knowledge on these GI differences in order to develop biorelevant predictive methods for this vulnerable population. A literature search was conducted within PubMed and Scopus to identify papers that describe how gastrointestinal physiology and anatomy is altered in malnourished children. Relevant data was extracted and a narrative review generated to describe how GI differences may affect oral drug absorption. Several differences in GI anatomy and physiology were reported in the literature including: reduced saliva secretion; increased gastric pH; slower gastric emptying; increased levels of bacteria in the small intestine; reduced surface area of intestinal villi and increased intestinal permeability. Much of the data was more than 30 years old and referred to a heterogeneous malnourished population. Sufficient data has been identified that will inform basic novel biorelevant methods to predict oral drug absorption in malnourished children.

387,Ten years of the manufacturing classification system: a review of literature applications and an extension of the framework to continuous manufacture.,"The MCS initiative was first introduced in 2013. Since then, two MCS papers have been published: the first proposing a structured approach to consider the impact of drug substance physical properties on manufacturability and the second outlining real world examples of MCS principles. By 2023, both publications had been extensively cited by over 240 publications. This article firstly reviews this citing work and considers how the MCS concepts have been received and are being applied. Secondly, we will extend the MCS framework to continuous manufacture. The review structure follows the flow of drug product development focussing first on optimisation of API properties. The exploitation of links between API particle properties and manufacturability using large datasets seems particularly promising. Subsequently, applications of the MCS for formulation design include a detailed look at the impact of percolation threshold, the role of excipients and how other classification systems can be of assistance. The final review section focusses on manufacturing process development, covering the impact of strain rate sensitivity and modelling applications. The second part of the paper focuses on continuous processing proposing a parallel MCS framework alongside the existing batch manufacturing guidance. Specifically, we propose that continuous direct compression can accommodate a wider range of API properties compared to its batch equivalent.","granulation, manufacturing, pharmaceutical, process development, tablet, batch, capsule, continuous manufacturing, development, formulation",Pharmaceutical Development And Technology,mc initi first introduc sinc two mc paper publish first propos structur approach consid impact drug substanc physic properti manufactur second outlin real world exampl mc principl public extens cite public articl firstli review cite work consid mc concept receiv appli secondli extend mc framework continu manufactur review structur follow flow drug product develop focus first optimis api properti exploit link api particl properti manufactur use larg dataset seem particularli promis subsequ applic mc formul design includ detail look impact percol threshold role excipi classif system assist final review section focus manufactur process develop cover impact strain rate sensit model applic second part paper focus continu process propos parallel mc framework alongsid exist batch manufactur guidanc specif propos continu direct compress accommod wider rang api properti compar batch equival ten year manufactur classif system review literatur applic extens framework continu manufactur
388,"Characterization of the lysergic acid diethylamide analog, 1-(thiophene-2-carbonyl)-N,N-diethyllysergamide (1T-LSD) from a blotter product.","Recently, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) analogs have appeared worldwide as designer drugs. In this study, we identified a distributed LSD analog from a paper-sheet product. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), liquid chromatography-photodiode array-mass spectrometry (LC-PDA-MS), and liquid chromatography with hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS) were used to analyze the sheet product. The sheet product claimed to contain 1-(1,2-dimethylcyclobutanoyl)-N,N-diethyllysergamide (1D-LSD). However, an unknown compound was detected in the product together with tryptamine and L-tryptophan methyl ester. This compound was isolated from the sheets and identified as 1-(thiophene-2-carbonyl)-N,N-diethyl-6-methyl-9,10-didehydroergoline-8β-carboxamide (1-thiophenoyl LSD; 1-(2-thienoyl)-LSD, 1T-LSD), using <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>13</sup>C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and various two-dimensional NMR techniques. 1T-LSD was shown to have the thiophene-2-carbonyl group at the N<sup>1</sup> position instead of the 1,2-dimethylcyclobutane-carbonyl group as claimed. The amount of 1T-LSD (free base) in three individual unit from one sheet was determined to be 87-100 μg per unit using a proton-specific quantitative NMR (<sup>1</sup>H-qNMR) method. Deacylation of 1T-LSD to LSD was also observed to occur in methanol-d<sub>4</sub> during NMR analysis. The UV spectrum of 1T-LSD differed from that of other LSD analogs, and the fluorescence sensitivity was much lower. Because of concerns about the future distribution of products containing new LSD analogs, continued monitoring of newly detected compounds in sheet products is encouraged.","1d‐lsd, lsd, nps, blotter paper, lysergamides, lysergic acid diethylamide, new psychoactive substance, quantitative nmr",Drug Testing And Analysis,recent lyserg acid diethylamid lsd analog appear worldwid design drug studi identifi distribut lsd analog product ga spectrometri liquid spectrometri liquid chromatographi hybrid quadrupol mass spectrometri use analyz sheet product sheet product claim contain howev unknown compound detect product togeth tryptamin methyl ester compound isol sheet identifi lsd use sup h sup c nuclear magnet reson nmr spectroscopi variou nmr techniqu shown group n sup posit instead group claim amount free base three individu unit one sheet determin μg per unit use quantit nmr sup method deacyl lsd also observ occur sub nmr analysi uv spectrum differ lsd analog fluoresc sensit much lower concern futur distribut product contain new lsd analog continu monitor newli detect compound sheet product encourag character lyserg acid diethylamid analog blotter product
389,Paper based analytical devices for blood grouping: a comprehensive review.,"The clinical importance of blood group (BG) antigens is related to their ability to induce immune antibodies that can cause hemolysis. Yet, ABO and D (Rh) are still considered to be the key antigens for healthy blood transfusion and secondary antigens are the next priority. Serological typing is the most widely used typing method. Rapid and accurate blood grouping plays an important role in some clinical conditions, rather than conventional techniques. Hence, developing a simple and economical model for rapid blood grouping would facilitate these tests. In recent decades, paper-based microfluidics such as μPADs has gained much interest in wide application areas such as point-of-care diagnostic. In this study, we evaluated μPADs that are performed for blood grouping and its recent progress. A comprehensive literature search was performed using databases including PUBMED, SCOPUS, Web of Science and Google Scholar. Keywords were blood grouping or typing, paper analytical device, rapid test, etc. After investigation of search results, 16 papers from 2010 to 2020 were included. Further information in detail was classified in Table 1. Generally, two principles for blood typing μPADs are introduced. The lateral chromatographic flow method and the vertical flow-through method that detects BG in a visual-based manner. To detect results with acceptable clarity many factors and challenges like paper, blood sample, buffer, Ab and RBC interaction and also μPADs stability need to be considered, which are discussed. In conclusion, the simplicity, stability, cheapness, portability and biocompatibility of μPADs for blood grouping confirming its utility and also they have the capability to robust, universal blood-grouping platform.

390,What's new in the field of phospholipid vesicular nanocarriers for skin drug delivery.,"Over the last three decades, research in the field of phospholipid nanocarriers as tools to improve dermal and transdermal drug delivery has grown substantially. In particular, liposomes have been the target of studies aimed at reformulating vesicles with a greater ability to deliver drugs trans-dermally. A number of additives with varied physicochemical properties have been combined with traditional components of liposomes. These novel modification processes have produced new classes of vesicles with the potential to enhance the treatment of both dermatological disorders and systemic pathologies. Development of the first deformable and elastic phospholipid vesicles has highlighted the key role of vesicle composition in promoting release of vesicle content into and through the skin. This paper discusses the key vesicle properties and mechanisms of delivery by which newly developed phospholipid vesicles can improve percutaneous drug delivery.","dermal drug delivery, ethosomes, liposomes, pevs, phospholipids, transdermal drug delivery, transfersomes",International Journal Of Pharmaceutics,last three decad research field phospholipid nanocarri tool improv dermal transderm drug deliveri grown substanti particular liposom target studi aim reformul vesicl greater abil deliv drug number addit vari physicochem properti combin tradit compon liposom novel modif process produc new class vesicl potenti enhanc treatment dermatolog disord system patholog develop first deform elast phospholipid vesicl highlight key role vesicl composit promot releas vesicl content skin paper discus key vesicl properti mechan deliveri newli develop phospholipid vesicl improv percutan drug deliveri new field phospholipid vesicular nanocarri skin drug deliveri
391,Rapid screening and multicomponent quantifications of active components of oral syrup over-the-counter medications by Raman and UV-visible spectroscopy and multivariate regression analysis.,"Over-the-counter medications (OTCMs) are frequently recommended as a first-line treatment for common ailments, diseases, and illnesses. Oral liquid dosage forms are advantageous for rapid absorption with no dissolution time and are easier for pediatric and geriatric consumers to swallow. The production of these medicines by pharmaceutical industry makes them readily available to the public. Although the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) provides strict guidelines to drug manufacturers of these products; the risk of counterfeiting is a global issue. This can lead to several adverse effects and health issues. Here, we report a fast screening and quality assurance method using Raman and UV-visible spectroscopy combined with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Partial-Least-Square (PLS) regression of commonly used OTCM oral syrups. PLS regressions of UV-visible absorption spectra were used for multicomponent quantifications of the active component (acetaminophen, guaifenesin, dextromethorphan HBr, and phenylephrine HCl) concentrations of OTMCs in flavored (sugar or sugar-free) oral syrups. Raman and UV-visible spectral responses varied based on the type and concentration of the active component analyzed. PCA of the spectral data provided pattern recognition of the oral syrup OTCM. The developed PLS method demonstrated good linearity with an R<sup>2</sup> > 0.9784 and high sensitivity with a low detection limit of 0.02 mg/mL for acetaminophen and guaifenesin. Moreover, the simultaneous quantification of concentrations of all active components by the described method yielded good accuracies ranging from 88 to 94%. This study provides an example of the benefits of the combined use of Raman and UV-vis spectral profiling, PCA, and PLS regression for the quality analysis of oral syrups OTCM providing multicomponent quantification of active components with no need for sample extraction. The reported method can be easily adapted and scaled for online detection analysis used in the drug manufacturing industry, both in-situ and field analysis, and for the quality control of syrups OTCM by regulatory agencies and quality control officers.","dextromethorphan hbr, guaifenesin, multicomponent acetaminophen, over-the-counter-medication, partial-least squares regression, phenylephrine hcl analyses, principal component analysis, raman spectroscopy, uv–visible spectroscopy","Spectrochimica Acta.

392,Research on prediction of human oral bioavailability of drugs based on improved deep forest.,"Human oral bioavailability is a crucial factor in drug discovery. In recent years, researchers have constructed a variety of different prediction models. However, given the limited size of human oral bioavailability data sets, the challenge of making accurate predictions with small sample sizes has become a critical issue in the field. The deep forest model, with its adaptively determinable number of cascade levels, can perform exceptionally well even on small-scale data. However, the original deep forest suffers unbalanced multi-grained scanning process and premature stopping of cascade forest training. In this paper, we propose a human oral bioavailability predict method based on an improved deep forest, called balanced multi-grained scanning mapping cascade forest (bgmc-forest). Firstly, the mordred descriptor method is selected to feature extraction, then enhanced features are obtained by the improved balanced multi-grained scanning, which solves the problem of missing features at both ends. And finally, the prediction results are obtained by feature mapping cascaded forests, which is based on principal component analysis and cascade forests, ensures the effectiveness of the cascade forest. The superiority of the model constructed in this paper is demonstrated through comparative experiments, while the effectiveness of the improved module is verified through ablation experiments. Finally the decision-making process of the model is explained by the shapley additive explanations interpretation algorithm.","bioavailability, deep forest, molecular modeling",Journal Of Molecular Graphics & Modelling,human oral bioavail crucial factor drug discoveri recent year research construct varieti differ predict model howev given limit size human oral bioavail data set challeng make accur predict small sampl size becom critic issu field deep forest model adapt determin number cascad level perform except well even data howev origin deep forest suffer unbalanc scan process prematur stop cascad forest train paper propos human oral bioavail predict method base improv deep forest call balanc scan map cascad forest firstli mordr descriptor method select featur extract enhanc featur obtain improv balanc scan solv problem miss featur end final predict result obtain featur map cascad forest base princip compon analysi cascad forest ensur effect cascad forest superior model construct paper demonstr compar experi effect improv modul verifi ablat experi final process model explain shapley addit explan interpret algorithm research predict human oral bioavail drug base improv deep forest
393,Environmental and bioanalytical applications of hollow fiber membrane liquid-phase microextraction: a review.,"In hollow fiber membrane liquid-phase microextraction (LPME), target analytes are extracted from aqueous samples and into a supported liquid membrane (SLM) sustained in the pores in the wall of a small porous hollow fiber, and further into an acceptor phase present inside the lumen of the hollow fiber. The acceptor phase can be organic, providing a two-phase extraction system compatible with capillary gas chromatography, or the acceptor phase can be aqueous resulting in a three-phase system compatible with high-performance liquid chromatography or capillary electrophoresis. Due to high enrichment, efficient sample clean-up, and the low consumption of organic solvent, substantial interest has been devoted to LPME in recent years. This paper reviews important applications of LPME with special focus on bioanalytical and environmental chemistry, and also covers a new possible direction for LPME namely electromembrane extraction, where analytes are extracted through the SLM and into the acceptor phase by the application of electrical potentials.",no keywords,Analytica Chimica Acta,hollow fiber membran microextract lpme target analyt extract aqueou sampl support liquid membran slm sustain pore wall small porou hollow fiber acceptor phase present insid lumen hollow fiber acceptor phase organ provid extract system compat capillari ga chromatographi acceptor phase aqueou result system compat liquid chromatographi capillari electrophoresi due high enrich effici sampl low consumpt organ solvent substanti interest devot lpme recent year paper review import applic lpme special focu bioanalyt environment chemistri also cover new possibl direct lpme name electromembran extract analyt extract slm acceptor phase applic electr potenti environment bioanalyt applic hollow fiber membran microextract review
394,In situ gelling systems for ocular drug delivery.,"In situ gelling systems represent a burgeoning paradigm in ocular drug administration, addressing intrinsic challenges posed by extant ocular formulations, such as compromised bioavailability and constraints in traversing the corneal barrier. This systematic review endeavours to comprehensively examine the contemporary landscape of research in this domain, focusing on the nuanced capabilities of in situ gelling systems to optimize drug delivery and enhance therapeutic outcomes, without much technological complexity. Employing a meticulous search strategy across diverse databases for publications and patents spanning the years 2015 to 2023 a total of 26 research papers and 14 patents meeting stringent inclusion criteria were identified. Synthesizing the collective insights derived from these investigations, it becomes evident that in situ gelling systems confer an ability to protract the residence time of formulations or active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) within the ocular milieu. This sustained presence engenders extended drug release kinetics, thereby fostering improved patient compliance and mitigating the proclivity for side effects attendant to frequent dosing. These salutary effects extend to diminished systemic drug absorption, augmented ocular bioavailability, and the prospect of reduced dosing frequencies, thereby amplifying patient adherence to therapeutic regimens. Intriguingly, the protective attributes of in situ gelling systems extend to the establishment of an ocular surface barrier, thereby abating the susceptibility to infections and inflammatory responses. In summation, this review underscores the auspicious potential of in situ gelling systems as a transformative approach to advancing ocular drug delivery, warranting sustained research endeavours and developmental initiatives for the betterment of global patient outcomes.","bioavailability, ophthalmic, patent, polymer, topical",Journal Of Controlled Release : Official Journal Of The Controlled Release Society,situ gell system repres burgeon paradigm ocular drug administr address intrins challeng pose extant ocular formul compromis bioavail constraint travers corneal barrier systemat review endeavour comprehens examin contemporari landscap research domain focus nuanc capabl situ gell system optim drug deliveri enhanc therapeut outcom without much technolog complex employ meticul search strategi across diver databas public patent span year total research paper patent meet stringent inclus criterion identifi synthes collect insight deriv investig becom evid situ gell system confer abil protract resid time formul activ pharmaceut ingredi api within ocular milieu sustain presenc engend extend drug releas kinet therebi foster improv patient complianc mitig procliv side effect attend frequent dose salutari effect extend diminish system drug absorpt augment ocular bioavail prospect reduc dose frequenc therebi amplifi patient adher therapeut regimen intriguingli protect attribut situ gell system extend establish ocular surfac barrier therebi abat suscept infect inflammatori respons summat review underscor auspici potenti situ gell system transform approach advanc ocular drug deliveri warrant sustain research endeavour development initi better global patient outcom situ gell system ocular drug deliveri
395,Effect of diabetes mellitus on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of drugs.,"The effects of diabetes mellitus on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs have been well described in experimental animal models; however, only minimal data exist for humans and the current knowledge regarding the effects of diabetes on these properties remains unclear. Nevertheless, it has been observed that the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs are changed in subjects with diabetes. It has been reported that diabetes may affect the pharmacokinetics of various drugs by affecting (i) absorption, due to changes in subcutaneous adipose blood flow, muscle blood flow and gastric emptying; (ii) distribution, due to non-enzymatic glycation of albumin; (iii) biotransformation, due to regulation of enzymes/transporters involved in drug biotransformation; and (iv) excretion, due to nephropathy. Previously published data also suggest that diabetes-mediated changes in the pharmacokinetics of a particular drug cannot be translated to others. Although clinical studies exploring the effect of diabetes on pharmacodynamics are still very limited, there is evidence that disease-mediated effects are not limited only to pharmacokinetics but also alter pharmacodynamics. However, for many drugs it remains unclear whether these influences reflect diabetes-mediated changes in pharmacokinetics rather than pharmacodynamics. In addition, even though diabetes-mediated pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics might be anticipated, it is important to study the effect on each drug and not generalize from observed data. The available data indicate that there is a significant variability in drug response in diabetic subjects. The discrepancies between individual clinical studies as well as between ex vivo and clinical studies are probably due to (i) the restricted and focused population of subjects in clinical studies; (ii) failure to consider type, severity and duration of the disease; (iii) histopathological characteristics generally being missing; and (iv) other factors such as varying medication use, dietary protein intake, age, sex and obesity. The obesity epidemic in the developed world has also inadvertently influenced the directions of pharmacological research. This review attempts to map new information gained since Gwilt published his paper in Clinical Pharmacokinetics in 1991. Although a large body of research has been conducted and significant progress has been made, we still have to conclude that the available information regarding the effect of diabetes on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics remains unclear and further clinical studies are required before we can understand the clinical significance of the effect. An understanding of diabetes-mediated changes as well as of the source of the variability should lead to the improvement of the medical management and clinical outcomes in patients with this widespread disease.",no keywords,Clinical Pharmacokinetics,effect diabet mellitu pharmacokinet pharmacodynam drug well describ experiment anim model howev minim data exist human current knowledg regard effect diabet properti remain unclear nevertheless observ pharmacokinet pharmacodynam drug chang subject diabet report diabet may affect pharmacokinet variou drug affect absorpt due chang subcutan adipos blood flow muscl blood flow gastric empti ii distribut due glycat albumin iii biotransform due regul involv drug biotransform iv excret due nephropathi previous publish data also suggest chang pharmacokinet particular drug translat other although clinic studi explor effect diabet pharmacodynam still limit evid effect limit pharmacokinet also alter pharmacodynam howev mani drug remain unclear whether influenc reflect chang pharmacokinet rather pharmacodynam addit even though pharmacokinet pharmacodynam might anticip import studi effect drug gener observ data avail data indic signific variabl drug respons diabet subject discrep individu clinic studi well ex vivo clinic studi probabl due restrict focus popul subject clinic studi ii failur consid type sever durat diseas iii histopatholog characterist gener miss iv factor vari medic use dietari protein intak age sex obes obes epidem develop world also inadvert influenc direct pharmacolog research review attempt map new inform gain sinc gwilt publish paper clinic pharmacokinet although larg bodi research conduct signific progress made still conclud avail inform regard effect diabet pharmacokinet pharmacodynam remain unclear clinic studi requir understand clinic signific effect understand chang well sourc variabl lead improv medic manag clinic outcom patient widespread diseas effect diabet mellitu pharmacokinet pharmacodynam properti drug
396,High-capacity conductive nanocellulose paper sheets for electrochemically controlled extraction of DNA oligomers.,"Highly porous polypyrrole (PPy)-nanocellulose paper sheets have been evaluated as inexpensive and disposable electrochemically controlled three-dimensional solid phase extraction materials. The composites, which had a total anion exchange capacity of about 1.1 mol kg(-1), were used for extraction and subsequent release of negatively charged fluorophore tagged DNA oligomers via galvanostatic oxidation and reduction of a 30-50 nm conformal PPy layer on the cellulose substrate. The ion exchange capacity, which was, at least, two orders of magnitude higher than those previously reached in electrochemically controlled extraction, originated from the high surface area (i.e. 80 m(2) g(-1)) of the porous composites and the thin PPy layer which ensured excellent access to the ion exchange material. This enabled the extractions to be carried out faster and with better control of the PPy charge than with previously employed approaches. Experiments in equimolar mixtures of (dT)(6), (dT)(20), and (dT)(40) DNA oligomers showed that all oligomers could be extracted, and that the smallest oligomer was preferentially released with an efficiency of up to 40% during the reduction of the PPy layer. These results indicate that the present material is very promising for the development of inexpensive and efficient electrochemically controlled ion-exchange membranes for batch-wise extraction of biomolecules.",no keywords,Plos One,highli porou polypyrrol ppi paper sheet evalu inexpens dispos electrochem control solid phase extract materi composit total anion exchang capac mol kg use extract subsequ releas neg charg fluorophor tag dna oligom via galvanostat oxid reduct nm conform ppi layer cellulos substrat ion exchang capac least two order magnitud higher previous reach electrochem control extract origin high surfac area g porou composit thin ppi layer ensur excel access ion exchang materi enabl extract carri faster better control ppi charg previous employ approach experi equimolar mixtur dt dt dt dna oligom show oligom could extract smallest oligom preferenti releas effici reduct ppi layer result indic present materi promis develop inexpens effici electrochem control membran extract biomolecul conduct nanocellulos paper sheet electrochem control extract dna oligom
397,Toward practical application of paper-based microfluidics for medical diagnostics: state-of-the-art and challenges.,"Microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (μPADs) have emerged as a promising diagnostic platform a decade ago. In contrast to highly active academic developments, their entry into real-life applications is still very limited. This discrepancy is attributed to the gap between research developments and their practical utility, particularly in the aspects of operational simplicity, long-term stability of devices, and associated equipment. On the basis of these backgrounds, this review attempts to: 1) identify the reasons for success of paper-based devices already in the market, 2) describe the current status and remaining issues of μPADs in terms of operational complexity, signal interpretation approaches, and storage stability, and 3) discuss the possibility of mass production based on established manufacturing technologies.

399,A review on protein functionalized carbon nanotubes.,"Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been widely recognized and used for controlled drug delivery and in various other fields due to their unique properties and distinct advantages. Both single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and multiwalled (MWCNTs) carbon nanotubes are used and/or studied for potential applications in medical, energy, textile, composite, and other areas. Since CNTs are chemically inert and are insoluble in water or other organic solvents, they are functionalized or modified to carry payloads or interact with biological molecules. CNTs have been preferably functionalized with proteins because CNTs are predominantly used for medical applications such as delivery of drugs, DNA and genes, and also for biosensing. Extensive studies have been conducted to understand the interactions, cytotoxicity, and potential applications of protein functionalized CNTs but contradicting results have been published on the cytotoxicity of the functionalized CNTs. This paper provides a brief review of CNTs functionalized with proteins, methods used to functionalize the CNTs, and their potential applications.",no keywords,Journal Of Applied Biomaterials & Functional Materials,carbon nanotub cnt wide recogn use control drug deliveri variou field due uniqu properti distinct advantag carbon nanotub swcnt multiwal mwcnt carbon nanotub use studi potenti applic medic energi textil composit area sinc cnt chemic inert insolubl water organ solvent function modifi carri payload interact biolog molecul cnt prefer function protein cnt predominantli use medic applic deliveri drug dna gene also biosens extens studi conduct understand interact cytotox potenti applic protein function cnt contradict result publish cytotox function cnt paper provid brief review cnt function protein method use function cnt potenti applic review protein function carbon nanotub
400,"Growth hormone, enhancement and the pharmaceuticalisation of short stature.","This paper takes the biological drug human Growth Hormone (hGH) as a case study to investigate processes of pharmaceuticalisation and medicalisation in configuring childhood short stature as a site for pharmaceutical intervention. Human growth hormone is considered to have legitimate applications in treating childhood growth hormone deficiency and short stature associated with other recognised conditions. It is also regarded by bioethicists and others as a form of human biomedical enhancement when applied to children with idiopathic or 'normal' short stature. The purpose of this study is not to evaluate whether treatment of idiopathic short stature is enhancement or not, but to evaluate how some applications of hGH in treating short stature have come to be accepted and stabilised as legitimate 'therapies' while others remain contested as 'enhancements'. A comparative, historical approach is employed, drawing on approaches from medical sociology and Science and Technology Studies (STS) to set out a socio-technical history of hGH in the US and UK. Through this history the relative influence and interplay of drivers of pharmaceuticalisation, including industry marketing and networks of drug distribution, and processes of medicalisation will be employed to address this question and simultaneously query the value of enhancement as a sociological concept.","growth hormone, history, human enhancement, medicalisation, pharmaceuticalisation, sts, uk, usa",Social Science & Medicine (1982),paper take biolog drug human growth hormon hgh case studi investig process pharmaceuticalis medicalis configur childhood short statur site pharmaceut intervent human growth hormon consid legitim applic treat childhood growth hormon defici short statur associ recognis condit also regard bioethicist other form human biomed enhanc appli child idiopath short statur purpos studi evalu whether treatment idiopath short statur enhanc evalu applic hgh treat short statur come accept stabilis legitim other remain contest compar histor approach employ draw approach medic sociolog scienc technolog studi st set histori hgh u uk histori rel influenc interplay driver pharmaceuticalis includ industri market network drug distribut process medicalis employ address question simultan queri valu enhanc sociolog concept growth hormon enhanc pharmaceuticalis short statur

402,Did the Olympics need more drugs? a doctor's reflection on providing medical care during Op OLYMPICS.,"This paper examines some of the medical problems arising from the successful deployment of Defence Medical Services personnel to Op OLYMPICS (mid-June 2012-September 2012). It does not aim to be all encompassing in its scope, but focuses on the most pressing issues affecting a junior military doctor's ability to work effectively under field conditions. This will entail a discussion about whether in a deployment such as Op OLYMPICS medical care should be based upon offering solely primary healthcare in medical centres or using Role 1 medical treatment facilities, which include primary healthcare and pre-hospital emergency care. The main recommendations arising from the deployment are: clinicians should deploy with a minimum of basic emergency drugs and equipment; a medical facility treating a large population at risk for a prolonged period should have a broad stock of medications available on site; and medical risk assessments must be performed on all Reservists during mobilisation.","education & training (see medical education & training), general medicine (see internal medicine)",Journal Of The Royal Army Medical Corps,paper examin medic problem aris success deploy defenc medic servic personnel op olymp aim encompass scope focus press issu affect junior militari doctor abil work effect field condit entail discus whether deploy op olymp medic care base upon offer sole primari healthcar medic centr use role medic treatment facil includ primari healthcar emerg care main recommend aris deploy clinician deploy minimum basic emerg drug equip medic facil treat larg popul risk prolong period broad stock medic avail site medic risk assess must perform reservist mobilis olymp need drug doctor reflect provid medic care op olymp
403,Practical issues of hyperspectral imaging analysis of solid dosage forms.,"Hyperspectral imaging techniques have widely demonstrated their usefulness in different areas of interest in pharmaceutical research during the last decade. In particular, middle infrared, near infrared, and Raman methods have gained special relevance. This rapid increase has been promoted by the capability of hyperspectral techniques to provide robust and reliable chemical and spatial information on the distribution of components in pharmaceutical solid dosage forms. Furthermore, the valuable combination of hyperspectral imaging devices with adequate data processing techniques offers the perfect landscape for developing new methods for scanning and analyzing surfaces. Nevertheless, the instrumentation and subsequent data analysis are not exempt from issues that must be thoughtfully considered.

Additionally, extant guidance developed by regulatory agencies worldwide does not fully address the specificities of neonatal drug development, especially among extremely premature newborns who currently survive. Consequently, an international consortium from Canada, Europe, Japan, and the United States was organized by the Critical Path Institute to address the content of guidance. This group included neonatologists, neonatal nurses, parents, regulators, ethicists, clinical pharmacologists, specialists in pharmacokinetics, specialists in clinical trials and pediatricians working in the pharmaceutical industry. This group has developed a comprehensive, referenced White Paper to guide neonatal clinical trials of medicines - particularly early phase studies. Key points include: the need to base product development on neonatal physiology and pharmacology while making the most of knowledge acquired in other settings; the central role of families in research; and the value of the whole neonatal team in the design, implementation and interpretation of studies.

Oral NPs have been used as a physical approach to improve the solubility and the stability of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in the gastrointestinal juices, to enhance the intestinal permeability of drugs, to sustain and to control the release of encapsulated APIs allowing the dosing frequency to be reduced, and finally, to achieve both local and systemic drug targeting. Numerous materials have been used in the formulation of oral NPs leading to different nanoparticulate platforms.

408,Establishing conditions for the storage and elution of rabies virus RNA using FTA(®) cards.,"The Flinders Technology Associates filter paper cards (FTA(®) cards) can be used to store nucleic acid from various samples and are easily portable. However, RNA is physicochemically unstable compared with DNA, and appropriate methods have not been established for storage and extraction of RNA from FTA(®) cards. The present study investigated the optimum conditions for storage and elution of viral RNA (vRNA) using rabies virus (RABV) applied to FTA(®) cards. When TE buffer was used, the elution rates of vRNA increased with the length of the elution time. When the cards were stored at -80 °C or -20 °C, vRNA was stable over 3 months. Degradation of vRNAs occurred following storage at 4 °C and room temperature, suggesting that RNA should be extracted from cards as soon as possible if no freezer is available. When we tried to amplify vRNA from RABV-infected animal brains applied to FTA(®) cards and stored at -80 °C for 6 months, we did not detect any amplified products with the primer set for 964 bp of RABV N gene. However, we were able to detect amplified products by increasing the elution time of vRNA from FTA(®) cards from 30 min to 24 hr or by changing the primer sets to amplify 290 bp of N gene. Thus, we recommend extending the elution time for damaged or low concentration samples in FTA(®) cards.",no keywords,The Journal Of Veterinary Medical Science,flinder technolog associ filter paper card fta card use store nucleic acid variou sampl easili portabl howev rna physicochem unstabl compar dna appropri method establish storag extract rna fta card present studi investig optimum condit storag elut viral rna vrna use rabi viru rabv appli fta card te buffer use elut rate vrna increas length elut time card store vrna stabl month degrad vrna occur follow storag room temperatur suggest rna extract card soon possibl freezer avail tri amplifi vrna anim brain appli fta card store month detect amplifi product primer set bp rabv n gene howev abl detect amplifi product increas elut time vrna fta card min hr chang primer set amplifi bp n gene thu recommend extend elut time damag low concentr sampl fta card establish condit storag elut rabi viru rna use fta card
409,Navigating the complexities of medicating paediatric patients: Insights from an enteral feeding tube workshop.,"Enteral feeding tubes (EFT) are used to administer nutrition into the gastrointestinal tract of patients who are unable to take nutrition via mouth. A wide range of children may require enteral feeding through EFT which are also used to administer medication. However, many medicines are not licensed for administration via this route. Numerous factors can impact EFT medicine administration, including for example, dosage form properties and composition, EFT size, design and material, and operational aspects such as tube flushing. As a result, the risk of sub-optimal dosing and medication error is much higher in patients with EFT compared to those without. EuPFI organised a preconference workshop to review the current state of knowledge around aspects to be considered in the verification of EFT administration of medications to children, and considerations for EFT use, and to highlight the areas that remain challenging. Healthcare professional, pharmaceutical industry and regulatory agency perspectives were shared, and case studies discussed. It was agreed that simple and clear standardised global procedures are required for the evaluation and administration of medicines via EFT, and collaboration between all key stakeholders is recommended.","administration, devices, enteral feeding tube, nasogastric tube, paediatric",European Journal Of Pharmaceutics And Biopharmaceutics : Official Journal Of Arbeitsgemeinschaft Fur Pharmazeutische Verfahrenstechnik E.V,enter feed tube eft use administ nutrit gastrointestin tract patient unabl take nutrit via mouth wide rang child may requir enter feed eft also use administ medic howev mani medicin licens administr via rout numer factor impact eft medicin administr includ exampl dosag form properti composit eft size design materi oper aspect tube flush result risk dose medic error much higher patient eft compar without eupfi organis preconfer workshop review current state knowledg around aspect consid verif eft administr medic child consider eft use highlight area remain challeng healthcar profession pharmaceut industri regulatori agenc perspect share case studi discus agre simpl clear standardis global procedur requir evalu administr medicin via eft collabor key stakehold recommend navig complex medic paediatr patient insight enter feed tube workshop

411,Non-invasive identification of incoming raw pharmaceutical materials using Spatially Offset Raman Spectroscopy.,"A new approach to verification of incoming raw materials through packaging in pharmaceutical manufacturing is proposed and demonstrated. The method is based around Spatially Offset Raman Spectroscopy (SORS) and permits a rapid chemical identity analysis of incoming materials to satisfy regulatory requirements but without the need to open the packaging. This dramatically increases the throughput of incoming raw materials into the pharmaceutical manufacturing chain and eliminates the need for a chemically safe sampling environment required for invasive inspection methods. Since the inspection is non-invasive the safety of the operators is ensured and the integrity of inspected material is not compromised by preventing exposure to the ambient atmosphere and cross contamination. The experiments presented here demonstrate the ability to accurately identify common pharmaceutical materials, typically in under 10s acquisition time, through a range of frequently used packaging, including translucent plastic and paper sacks and coloured glass bottles, which can be challenging for conventional Raman spectroscopy as well as other optical spectroscopy methods. With the exception of metallic containers and cardboard drums all the tested packaging materials proved to be amenable to this technique.

412,Rapid segmentation and sensitive analysis of CRP with paper-based microfluidic device using machine learning.,"Microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (μPADs) have been widely used in point-of-care testing owing to their simple operation, low volume of the sample required, and the lack of the need for an external force. To obtain accurate semi-quantitative or quantitative results, μPADs need to respond to the challenges posed by differences in reaction conditions. In this paper, multi-layer μPADs are fabricated by the imprinting method for the colorimetric detection of C-reactive protein (CRP). Different lighting conditions and shooting angles of scenes are simulated in image acquisition, and the detection-related performance of μPADs is improved by using a machine learning algorithm. The You Only Look Once (YOLO) model is used to identify the areas of reaction in μPADs. This model can observe an image only once to predict the objects present in it and their locations. The YOLO model trained in this study was able to identify all the reaction areas quickly without incurring any error. These reaction areas were categorized by classification algorithms to determine the risk level of CRP concentration. Multi-layer perceptron, convolutional neural network, and residual network algorithms were used for the classification tasks, where the latter yielded the highest accuracy of 96%. It has a promising application prospect in fast recognition and analysis of μPADs.","c-reactive protein (crp), machine learning, resnet, yolo, μpads",Analytical And Bioanalytical Chemistry,microfluid analyt devic μpad wide use test owe simpl oper low volum sampl requir lack need extern forc obtain accur quantit result μpad need respond challeng pose differ reaction condit paper μpad fabric imprint method colorimetr detect protein crp differ light condit shoot angl scene simul imag acquisit perform μpad improv use machin learn algorithm look yolo model use identifi area reaction μpad model observ imag predict object present locat yolo model train studi abl identifi reaction area quickli without incur error reaction area categor classif algorithm determin risk level crp concentr perceptron convolut neural network residu network algorithm use classif task latter yield highest accuraci promis applic prospect fast recognit analysi μpad rapid segment sensit analysi crp microfluid devic use machin learn
413,Real world big data for clinical research and drug development.,"The objective of this paper is to identify the extent to which real world data (RWD) is being utilized, or could be utilized, at scale in drug development. Through screening peer-reviewed literature, we have cited specific examples where RWD can be used for biomarker discovery or validation, gaining a new understanding of a disease or disease associations, discovering new markers for patient stratification and targeted therapies, new markers for identifying persons with a disease, and pharmacovigilance. None of the papers meeting our criteria was specifically geared toward novel targets or indications in the biopharmaceutical sector; the majority were focused on the area of public health, often sponsored by universities, insurance providers or in combination with public health bodies such as national insurers. The field is still in an early phase of practical application, and is being harnessed broadly where it serves the most direct need in public health applications in early, rare and novel disease incidents. However, these exemplars provide a valuable contribution to insights on the use of RWD to create novel, faster and less invasive approaches to advance disease understanding and biomarker discovery. We believe that pharma needs to invest in making better use of Electronic Health Records and the need for more precompetitive collaboration to grow the scale of this 'big denominator' capability, especially given the needs of precision medicine research.",no keywords,Drug Discovery Today,object paper identifi extent real world data rwd util could util scale drug develop screen literatur cite specif exampl rwd use biomark discoveri valid gain new understand diseas diseas associ discov new marker patient stratif target therapi new marker identifi person diseas pharmacovigil none paper meet criterion specif gear toward novel target indic biopharmaceut sector major focus area public health often sponsor univers insur provid combin public health bodi nation insur field still earli phase practic applic har broadli serv direct need public health applic earli rare novel diseas incid howev exemplar provid valuabl contribut insight use rwd creat novel faster less invas approach advanc diseas understand biomark discoveri believ pharma need invest make better use electron health record need precompetit collabor grow scale denomin capabl especi given need precis medicin research real world big data clinic research drug develop

420,Drug target residence time: a misleading concept.,"Since the importance of drug target residence time was first highlighted more 10 years ago, slow binding kinetics has received much attention in the drug discovery literature, and indeed within pharmaceutical research. However, the residence concept as presented in most papers is supported by rather misleading simulations and arguments, and by examples where compounds are taken out of their pharmacokinetic context. Moreover, fast association is typically more desirable than slow, and advantages of long residence time, notably a potential disconnect between pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacokinetics (PK), would be partially or completely offset by slow on-rate. Therefore, plain potency is likely a better predictor of drug development success than is residence time.",no keywords,Drug Discovery Today,sinc import drug target resid time first highlight year ago slow bind kinet receiv much attent drug discoveri literatur inde within pharmaceut research howev resid concept present paper support rather mislead simul argument exampl compound taken pharmacokinet context moreov fast associ typic desir slow advantag long resid time notabl potenti disconnect pharmacodynam pd pharmacokinet pk would partial complet offset slow therefor plain potenc like better predictor drug develop success resid time drug target resid time mislead concept
421,Improving properties of Hanji by coating chitosan-silver nanoparticle solution.,"A chitosan-silver nanoparticle solution (CSNS) was applied as a coating material to Hanji (Korean traditional paper), and the properties of the coated paper were investigated as a function of the dilution ratio. The required CSNS was first prepared from AgNO<sub>3</sub> (30mmol) by utilizing chitosan as a reducing and stabilizing agent via ultrasonication. The as-prepared CSNS was diluted to various ratios (undiluted, 1/10, 1/100, and 1/1000) and applied to Hanji by a dip-coating method. The tensile, burst, oil resistance, and antibacterial properties of the coated Hanji against Escherichia coli were evaluated. Among the various dilution ratios, the maximum level of dilution that can positively influence the tensile, burst, oil resistance, and antibacterial properties of Hanji was identified as 1/10, 1/100, 1/10 and 1/1000 of the pure CSNS, respectively. These findings are significant because a specific property of Hanji can be economically improved by changing the dilution ratio.","chitosan, hanji, silver nanoparticles",International Journal Of Biological Macromolecules,nanoparticl solut csn appli coat materi hanji korean tradit paper properti coat paper investig function dilut ratio requir csn first prepar agno sub util chitosan reduc stabil agent via ultrason csn dilut variou ratio undilut appli hanji method tensil burst oil resist antibacteri properti coat hanji escherichia coli evalu among variou dilut ratio maximum level dilut posit influenc tensil burst oil resist antibacteri properti hanji identifi pure csn respect find signific specif properti hanji econom improv chang dilut ratio improv properti hanji coat nanoparticl solut
422,Modifications of the Method for Calculating Absolute Drug Bioavailability.,"Absolute bioavailability (F) is calculated as the ratio of the area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve (AUC) between extravascular administration and intravenous injection. However, as distribution of a drug after intravenous administration does not reach an equilibrium in the body during the distribution phase, the plasma drug concentration at this phase does not reflect the total amount of drug in the body. The goal of this paper was to analyze the insufficiencies of the method for calculating on absolute bioavailability and to propose a modification to improve the calculation.",no keywords,"Journal Of Pharmacy & Pharmaceutical Sciences : A Publication Of The Canadian Society For Pharmaceutical Sciences, Societe Canadienne Des Sciences Pharmaceutiques",absolut bioavail f calcul ratio area plasma drug curv auc extravascular administr intraven inject howev distribut drug intraven administr reach equilibrium bodi distribut phase plasma drug concentr phase reflect total amount drug bodi goal paper analyz insuffici method calcul absolut bioavail propos modif improv calcul modif method calcul absolut drug bioavail
423,The read-across hypothesis and environmental risk assessment of pharmaceuticals.,"Pharmaceuticals in the environment have received increased attention over the past decade, as they are ubiquitous in rivers and waterways. Concentrations are in sub-ng to low μg/L, well below acute toxic levels, but there are uncertainties regarding the effects of chronic exposures and there is a need to prioritise which pharmaceuticals may be of concern. The read-across hypothesis stipulates that a drug will have an effect in non-target organisms only if the molecular targets such as receptors and enzymes have been conserved, resulting in a (specific) pharmacological effect only if plasma concentrations are similar to human therapeutic concentrations. If this holds true for different classes of pharmaceuticals, it should be possible to predict the potential environmental impact from information obtained during the drug development process. This paper critically reviews the evidence for read-across, and finds that few studies include plasma concentrations and mode of action based effects. Thus, despite a large number of apparently relevant papers and a general acceptance of the hypothesis, there is an absence of documented evidence. There is a need for large-scale studies to generate robust data for testing the read-across hypothesis and developing predictive models, the only feasible approach to protecting the environment.",no keywords,Environmental Science & Technology,pharmaceut environ receiv increas attent past decad ubiquit river waterway concentr low well acut toxic level uncertainti regard effect chronic exposur need prioritis pharmaceut may concern hypothesi stipul drug effect organ molecular target receptor enzym conserv result specif pharmacolog effect plasma concentr similar human therapeut concentr hold true differ class pharmaceut possibl predict potenti environment impact inform obtain drug develop process paper critic review evid find studi includ plasma concentr mode action base effect thu despit larg number appar relev paper gener accept hypothesi absenc document evid need studi gener robust data test hypothesi develop predict model feasibl approach protect environ hypothesi environment risk assess pharmaceut

425,On-Site Ultrasensitive Detection Paper for Multiclass Chemical Contaminants via Universal Bridge-Antibody Labeling: Mycotoxin and Illegal Additives in Milk as an Example.,"Multiclass chemical contamination of food has aroused ever-increasing attention due to the increasingly common findings of the co-occurrence of multiclass contamination, such as mycotoxin (aflatoxin M1, AFM1) and illegal additive (melamine, MEL). In the present study, a rapid, ultrasensitive detection paper was developed on the basis of a unique bridge-antibody label to realize on-site simultaneous detection of AFM1 and MEL in milk. This detection paper used the bridge-antibody label on fluorescent particles (i.e., the fluorescent Eu nanoparticles were first conjugated with polyclonal antibodies and then with monoclonal antibodies). Dramatically enhanced sensitivity was found, probably due to the increase in immobilization of efficient monoclonal antibodies onto microspheres. Under optimal conditions, the lower limits of detection were 0.009 and 0.024 ng/mL for AFM1 and MEL in milk, respectively, in comparison with similar works. Moreover, the cutoff values were 0.4 and 150 ng/mL for AFM1 and MEL, respectively.

426,"Wood-Derived Materials for Green Electronics, Biological Devices, and Energy Applications.","With the arising of global climate change and resource shortage, in recent years, increased attention has been paid to environmentally friendly materials. Trees are sustainable and renewable materials, which give us shelter and oxygen and remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Trees are a primary resource that human society depends upon every day, for example, homes, heating, furniture, and aircraft. Wood from trees gives us paper, cardboard, and medical supplies, thus impacting our homes, school, work, and play. All of the above-mentioned applications have been well developed over the past thousands of years. However, trees and wood have much more to offer us as advanced materials, impacting emerging high-tech fields, such as bioengineering, flexible electronics, and clean energy. Wood naturally has a hierarchical structure, composed of well-oriented microfibers and tracheids for water, ion, and oxygen transportation during metabolism. At higher magnification, the walls of fiber cells have an interesting morphology-a distinctly mesoporous structure. Moreover, the walls of fiber cells are composed of thousands of fibers (or macrofibrils) oriented in a similar angle. Nanofibrils and nanocrystals can be further liberated from macrofibrils by mechanical, chemical, and enzymatic methods. The obtained nanocellulose has unique optical, mechanical, and barrier properties and is an excellent candidate for chemical modification and reconfiguration. Wood is naturally a composite material, comprised of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Wood is sustainable, earth abundant, strong, biodegradable, biocompatible, and chemically accessible for modification; more importantly, multiscale natural fibers from wood have unique optical properties applicable to different kinds of optoelectronics and photonic devices. Today, the materials derived from wood are ready to be explored for applications in new technology areas, such as electronics, biomedical devices, and energy. The goal of this study is to review the fundamental structures and chemistries of wood and wood-derived materials, which are essential for a wide range of existing and new enabling technologies. The scope of the review covers multiscale materials and assemblies of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin as well as other biomaterials derived from wood, in regard to their major emerging applications. Structure-properties-application relationships will be investigated in detail. Understanding the fundamental properties of these structures is crucial for designing and manufacturing products for emerging applications. Today, a more holistic understanding of the interplay between the structure, chemistry, and performance of wood and wood-derived materials is advancing historical applications of these materials. This new level of understanding also enables a myriad of new and exciting applications, which motivate this review. There are excellent reviews already on the classical topic of woody materials, and some recent reviews also cover new understanding of these materials as well as potential applications. This review will focus on the uniqueness of woody materials for three critical applications: green electronics, biological devices, and energy storage and bioenergy.",no keywords,Chemical Reviews,aris global climat chang resourc shortag recent year increas attent paid environment friendli materi tree sustain renew materi give u shelter oxygen remov carbon dioxid atmospher tree primari resourc human societi depend upon everi day exampl home heat furnitur aircraft wood tree give u paper cardboard medic suppli thu impact home school work play applic well develop past thousand year howev tree wood much offer u advanc materi impact emerg field bioengin flexibl electron clean energi wood natur hierarch structur compos microfib tracheid water ion oxygen transport metabol higher magnif wall fiber cell interest distinctli mesopor structur moreov wall fiber cell compos thousand fiber macrofibril orient similar angl nanofibril nanocryst liber macrofibril mechan chemic enzymat method obtain nanocellulos uniqu optic mechan barrier properti excel candid chemic modif reconfigur wood natur composit materi compris cellulos hemicellulos lignin wood sustain earth abund strong biodegrad biocompat chemic access modif importantli multiscal natur fiber wood uniqu optic properti applic differ kind optoelectron photon devic today materi deriv wood readi explor applic new technolog area electron biomed devic energi goal studi review fundament structur chemistri wood materi essenti wide rang exist new enabl technolog scope review cover multiscal materi assembl cellulos hemicellulos lignin well biomateri deriv wood regard major emerg applic relationship investig detail understand fundament properti structur crucial design manufactur product emerg applic today holist understand interplay structur chemistri perform wood materi advanc histor applic materi new level understand also enabl myriad new excit applic motiv review excel review alreadi classic topic woodi materi recent review also cover new understand materi well potenti applic review focu uniqu woodi materi three critic applic green electron biolog devic energi storag bioenergi materi green electron biolog devic energi applic
427,"Investigating the disposal of expired and unused medication in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia: a cross-sectional study.","Background Improper disposal of medication has several possible consequences such as childhood poisoning, environmental pollution, a negative impact on wildlife, and antibiotic resistance. The number of studies conducted to characterize pharmaceutical disposal practices is limited, particularly in the Middle East. Objective The aim of this cross-sectional study was to examine the behaviour of individuals with respect to the disposal of expired and unused medications. Furthermore, we aimed to identify the best methods of education regarding appropriate, safe disposal of medication. Setting The study was carried out in King Khalid University Hospital (KKUH), and King Saud University (KSU), during a 3-month period from February 2015 to April 2015. Method Twelve hundred patients were randomly selected from KKUH and KSU. Participants were invited to complete paper-based questionnaire with self enumeration. Pilot testing was conducted and involved 50 randomly selected participants. Main outcome measures The proportion of expired medications present in the home and their therapeutic groups, disposal methods of expired and unused medications, and preferred educational methods regarding safe and proper disposing of medications. Results A substantial proportion (79.15 %) of respondents disposed of unwanted medication via household waste, while a small proportion (1.70 %) returned unwanted medication to a pharmacy. Although currently practised disposal methods are undoubtedly unsuitable, 70.20 % of respondents considered finding appropriate, safe methods via which to dispose of unwanted medication their responsibility, and 78.6 % expressed an interest in receiving information concerning the correct disposal of unwanted medication. Conclusion We have demonstrated that a low percentage of respondents have ever received information regarding correct medication disposal. Moreover, the results have shown that over half of the respondents store antibiotics in their households. Additionally, respondents weren't aware of the consequences of keeping expired medication at home. It is quite clear that the awareness of proper and safe drug disposal among the Saudi population is quite low making it a priority of concerned authorities to implement educational programs.","medication disposal, medication waste, saudi arabia, unused medications",International Journal Of Clinical Pharmacy,background improp dispos medic sever possibl consequ childhood poison environment pollut neg impact wildlif antibiot resist number studi conduct character pharmaceut dispos practic limit particularli middl east object aim studi examin behaviour individu respect dispos expir unus medic furthermor aim identifi best method educ regard appropri safe dispos medic set studi carri king khalid univers hospit kkuh king saud univers ksu period februari april method twelv hundr patient randomli select kkuh ksu particip invit complet questionnair self enumer pilot test conduct involv randomli select particip main outcom measur proport expir medic present home therapeut group dispos method expir unus medic prefer educ method regard safe proper dispos medic result substanti proport respond dispos unwant medic via household wast small proport return unwant medic pharmaci although current practis dispos method undoubtedli unsuit respond consid find appropri safe method via dispos unwant medic respons express interest receiv inform concern correct dispos unwant medic conclus demonstr low percentag respond ever receiv inform regard correct medic dispos moreov result shown half respond store antibiot household addit respond awar consequ keep expir medic home quit clear awar proper safe drug dispos among saudi popul quit low make prioriti concern author implement educ program investig dispos expir unus medic riyadh saudi arabia studi
428,Development of a Paper-Based Viscometer for Blood Plasma Using Colorimetric Analysis.,"The viscosity of biofluids can be used to acquire meaningful medical information on the conditions of a patient but has seldom been utilized in clinical practices owing to cumbersome measurement procedures and the need for large sample volumes. We present a colorimetric method to measure the viscosity of blood plasma using a paper-based viscometer developed in this study specifically for clinical diagnosis. The proposed analytical device consists of multilayered papers with fluid-loading, -mixing, and -measuring regions, and it can be fabricated readily in a simple manner using three-layered paper channels and tape. Moreover, the colorimetric analysis enables viscosity estimations by analyzing a single optical image. To validate the device performance, we measured the viscosities of fluids such as glycerin aqueous solutions, bovine-serum-albumin solution, dimethyl sulfoxide, and blood plasma. We found that the measured viscosities were in good agreement with the reference values. Finally, we developed a simple smartphone application for the viscosity measurements that helped enhance the convenience and utility of the paper-based viscometer while maintaining the measurement accuracy.",no keywords,Analytical Chemistry,viscos biofluid use acquir meaning medic inform condit patient seldom util clinic practic owe cumbersom measur procedur need larg sampl volum present colorimetr method measur viscos blood plasma use viscomet develop studi specif clinic diagnosi propos analyt devic consist multilay paper region fabric readili simpl manner use paper channel tape moreov colorimetr analysi enabl viscos estim analyz singl optic imag valid devic perform measur viscos fluid glycerin aqueou solut solut dimethyl sulfoxid blood plasma found measur viscos good agreement refer valu final develop simpl smartphon applic viscos measur help enhanc conveni util viscomet maintain measur accuraci develop viscomet blood plasma use colorimetr analysi

In most cases, pharmaceuticals are taken by roots and translocated into various tissues by transpiration and diffusion. Due to the plant uptake, the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in food sources such as vegetables is a public concern. Few review papers focusing on the uptake of pharmaceuticals, in particular antibiotics, and their translocation in plant tissues have been published. In the current review paper, the work conducted on the uptake of pharmaceuticals belonging to different therapeutic groups such as antibiotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, β-blockers and antiepileptics is reviewed. Such work includes the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in plants, translocation once taken by plants, toxicity studies as well as implications and future studies. Furthermore, the advantages and drawbacks associated with the detection and uptake of these pharmaceuticals by plants are discussed.

432,Pharmaceutical applications of vibrational chemical imaging and chemometrics: a review.,"The emergence of chemical imaging (CI) has gifted spectroscopy an additional dimension. Chemical imaging systems complement chemical identification by acquiring spatially located spectra that enable visualization of chemical compound distributions. Such techniques are highly relevant to pharmaceutics in that the distribution of excipients and active pharmaceutical ingredient informs not only a product's behavior during manufacture but also its physical attributes (dissolution properties, stability, etc.). The rapid image acquisition made possible by the emergence of focal plane array detectors, combined with publication of the Food and Drug Administration guidelines for process analytical technology in 2001, has heightened interest in the pharmaceutical applications of CI, notably as a tool for enhancing drug quality and understanding process. Papers on the pharmaceutical applications of CI have been appearing in steadily increasing numbers since 2000. The aim of the present paper is to give an overview of infrared, near-infrared and Raman imaging in pharmaceutics.

436,Container-content interactions with radiopharmaceuticals: Seeing is believing.,"This perspective article addresses the critical issue of container-content interactions in the administration of intravenous medications, with a focus on radiopharmaceuticals used in nuclear medicine. Medication administration errors pose a significant challenge to patient safety. The ""five rights"" framework-ensuring the right patient, drug, time, dose, and route-serves as a cornerstone for safe drug administration. In the context of radiopharmaceuticals, notable for their use in nuclear medicine, adherence to these principles is paramount due to their unique properties and role in diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. The article explores the impact of container materials, particularly in syringes, on radiopharmaceutical stability and administration accuracy. It delves into the complexities of sorption phenomena, highlighting studies demonstrating its occurrence and potential consequences, including variations in administered doses and compromised diagnostic or therapeutic outcomes. Noteworthy factors influencing sorption include the type of radiopharmaceutical, container composition, molecular properties, and dilution. Findings revealing residual activity in syringes and identifying specific components, such as lubricants, silicon gaskets, and plungers, contributing to adsorption are presented. Migration of metal contaminants from container to content is discussed, emphasizing the potential impact on radiochemical yield and stability. There is a need for comprehensive studies to characterize drug-container interactions and poses crucial questions about the true benefit patients derive from prescribed activities. It challenges current practices, suggesting a need for tailored activity levels, container validation protocols, and rigorous testing of hospital preparations. Ultimately, this perspective paper calls for a deeper understanding of these interactions, urging regulatory consideration and standardization to ensure optimal drug administration and patient outcomes.","adsorption, container-content interactions, hospital preparation, nuclear medicine, radiopharmaceuticals, syringes",European Journal Of Pharmaceutics And Biopharmaceutics : Official Journal Of Arbeitsgemeinschaft Fur Pharmazeutische Verfahrenstechnik E.V,perspect articl address critic issu interact administr intraven medic focu radiopharmaceut use nuclear medicin medic administr error pose signific challeng patient safeti five right right patient drug time dose cornerston safe drug administr context radiopharmaceut notabl use nuclear medicin adher principl paramount due uniqu properti role diagnost therapeut procedur articl explor impact contain materi particularli syring radiopharmaceut stabil administr accuraci delv complex sorption phenomenon highlight studi demonstr occurr potenti consequ includ variat administ dose compromis diagnost therapeut outcom noteworthi factor influenc sorption includ type radiopharmaceut contain composit molecular properti dilut find reveal residu activ syring identifi specif compon lubric silicon gasket plunger contribut adsorpt present migrat metal contamin contain content discus emphas potenti impact radiochem yield stabil need comprehens studi character interact pose crucial question true benefit patient deriv prescrib activ challeng current practic suggest need tailor activ level contain valid protocol rigor test hospit prepar ultim perspect paper call deeper understand interact urg regulatori consider standard ensur optim drug administr patient outcom interact radiopharmaceut see believ
437,High-throughput purification platform in support of drug discovery.,"The application of parallel synthesis is an efficient approach to explore the chemical space and to rapidly develop meaningful structure activity relationship (SAR) data for drug discovery programs. However, the effectiveness of the parallel synthesis requires a high throughput purification workflow that can process a large number of crude samples within a meaningful time frame. This paper describes a high throughput purification platform that has been adopted at Merck's Rahway research site. The platform includes the evaluation of crude samples, mass-directed HPLC purification, fraction analysis, compound registration, final compound purity assessment and assay distribution. Assisting with the sample tracking and the data management is the internally designed laboratory information management system, Light Automation Framework (LAF).

438,"Future supply chains enabled by continuous processing--opportunities and challenges. May 20-21, 2014 Continuous Manufacturing Symposium.","This paper examines the opportunities and challenges facing the pharmaceutical industry in moving to a primarily ""continuous processing""-based supply chain. The current predominantly ""large batch"" and centralized manufacturing system designed for the ""blockbuster"" drug has driven a slow-paced, inventory heavy operating model that is increasingly regarded as inflexible and unsustainable. Indeed, new markets and the rapidly evolving technology landscape will drive more product variety, shorter product life-cycles, and smaller drug volumes, which will exacerbate an already unsustainable economic model. Future supply chains will be required to enhance affordability and availability for patients and healthcare providers alike despite the increased product complexity. In this more challenging supply scenario, we examine the potential for a more pull driven, near real-time demand-based supply chain, utilizing continuous processing where appropriate as a key element of a more ""flow-through"" operating model. In this discussion paper on future supply chain models underpinned by developments in the continuous manufacture of pharmaceuticals, we have set out; The significant opportunities to moving to a supply chain flow-through operating model, with substantial opportunities in inventory reduction, lead-time to patient, and radically different product assurance/stability regimes. Scenarios for decentralized production models producing a greater variety of products with enhanced volume flexibility. Production, supply, and value chain footprints that are radically different from today's monolithic and centralized batch manufacturing operations. Clinical trial and drug product development cost savings that support more rapid scale-up and market entry models with early involvement of SC designers within New Product Development. The major supply chain and industrial transformational challenges that need to be addressed. The paper recognizes that although current batch operational performance in pharma is far from optimal and not necessarily an appropriate end-state benchmark for batch technology, the adoption of continuous supply chain operating models underpinned by continuous production processing, as full or hybrid solutions in selected product supply chains, can support industry transformations to deliver right-first-time quality at substantially lower inventory profiles.","bioavailability, biopharmaceuticals characterization, chemical stability, controlled delivery, controlled release, polymorphism, processing, tableting",Journal Of Pharmaceutical Sciences,paper examin opportun challeng face pharmaceut industri move primarili continu process suppli chain current predominantli larg batch central manufactur system design blockbust drug driven inventori heavi oper model increasingli regard inflex unsustain inde new market rapidli evolv technolog landscap drive product varieti shorter product smaller drug volum exacerb alreadi unsustain econom model futur suppli chain requir enhanc afford avail patient healthcar provid alik despit increas product complex challeng suppli scenario examin potenti pull driven near suppli chain util continu process appropri key element oper model discus paper futur suppli chain model underpin develop continu manufactur pharmaceut set signific opportun move suppli chain oper model substanti opportun inventori reduct patient radic differ product regim scenario decentr product model produc greater varieti product enhanc volum flexibl product suppli valu chain footprint radic differ today monolith central batch manufactur oper clinic trial drug product develop cost save support rapid market entri model earli involv sc design within new product develop major suppli chain industri transform challeng need address paper recogn although current batch oper perform pharma far optim necessarili appropri benchmark batch technolog adopt continu suppli chain oper model underpin continu product process full hybrid solut select product suppli chain support industri transform deliv qualiti substanti lower inventori profil futur suppli chain enabl continu process opportun challeng may continu manufactur symposium

This paper reviews recent advances in modeling skin permeability of hydrophilic solutes, including quantitative structure-permeability relationships (QSPR) and mechanistic models. A dataset of measured human skin permeability of hydrophilic and low hydrophobic solutes has been compiled. Generally statistically derived QSPR models under-estimate skin permeability of hydrophilic solutes. On the other hand, including additional aqueous pathway is necessary for mechanistic models to improve the prediction of skin permeability of hydrophilic solutes, especially for highly hydrophilic solutes. A consensus yet has to be reached as to how the aqueous pathway should be modeled. Nevertheless it is shown that the contribution of aqueous pathway can constitute to more than 95% of the overall skin permeability.

Few papers reported that solution crystallization processes give rise to acoustic emission signals that could be related to the development of the basic crystallization phenomena. This study is intended to demonstrate new perspectives opened up by the possible use of acoustic emission (AE) as a non-intrusive and non destructive sensor for monitoring solution crystallization with a particular focus being put on the presence of impurities in real industrial processes. The wealth of acquired AE information is highlighted and it is suggested that such information could allow the design of innovative multipurpose sensing strategies. It is shown notably that AE provides a very early detection of nucleation events, much before the onset of the so-called ""nucleation burst"". It is also shown that AE brings new insight into the effect of impurities on both the development of the crystallization process and the quality of the crystallized product.",no keywords,International Journal Of Pharmaceutics,acoust emiss ae success appli monitor rather wide varieti solid elabor process almost never evalu field industri pharmaceut crystal paper report solut crystal process give rise acoust emiss signal could relat develop basic crystal phenomenon studi intend demonstr new perspect open possibl use acoust emiss ae non destruct sensor monitor solut crystal particular focu put presenc impur real industri process wealth acquir ae inform highlight suggest inform could allow design innov multipurpos sen strategi shown notabl ae provid earli detect nucleat event much onset nucleat burst also shown ae bring new insight effect impur develop crystal process qualiti crystal product monitor industri pharmaceut crystal process use acoust emiss pure impur medium

It is a fast, easy, accurate, and nondestructive technique which allows an analyst to gain quantitative information about a component mixture without the necessity of authentic reference materials, as is the case with most other analytical techniques. This is ideal for the synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) that are in the early stages of development where authentic standards of the analytes may not be available. In this paper, the application of (19)F and (1)H qNMR for reaction monitoring and in situ potency determinations will be discussed for an early stage pharmaceutical candidate with several analytical challenges. These challenges include low UV absorption, low ionization, thermal instability, and lack of authentic reference standards. Quantitative NMR provided quick, fit-for-purpose solutions for process development where conventional separation techniques were limited.",no keywords,Analytical Chemistry,quantit nmr spectrometri qnmr attract viabl altern tradit chromatograph techniqu fast easi accur nondestruct techniqu allow analyst gain quantit inform compon mixtur without necess authent refer materi case analyt techniqu ideal synthesi activ pharmaceut ingredi api earli stage develop authent standard analyt may avail paper applic f h qnmr reaction monitor situ potenc determin discus earli stage pharmaceut candid sever analyt challeng challeng includ low uv absorpt low ioniz thermal instabl lack authent refer standard quantit nmr provid quick solut process develop convent separ techniqu limit applic quantit nmr reaction monitor situ yield determin earli stage pharmaceut candid
446,Assessment Methodology for Process Validation Lifecycle Stage 3A.,"The paper introduces evaluation methodologies and associated statistical approaches for process validation lifecycle Stage 3A. The assessment tools proposed can be applied to newly developed and launched small molecule as well as bio-pharma products, where substantial process and product knowledge has been gathered. The following elements may be included in Stage 3A: number of 3A batch determination; evaluation of critical material attributes, critical process parameters, critical quality attributes; in vivo in vitro correlation; estimation of inherent process variability (IPV) and PaCS index; process capability and quality dashboard (PCQd); and enhanced control strategy. US FDA guidance on Process Validation: General Principles and Practices, January 2011 encourages applying previous credible experience with suitably similar products and processes. A complete Stage 3A evaluation is a valuable resource for product development and future risk mitigation of similar products and processes. Elements of 3A assessment were developed to address industry and regulatory guidance requirements. The conclusions made provide sufficient information to make a scientific and risk-based decision on product robustness.","fda pv guidance, stage 3a, continued process verification, ongoing process verification, process validation lifecycle stages",Aaps Pharmscitech,paper introduc evalu methodolog associ statist approach process valid lifecycl stage assess tool propos appli newli develop launch small molecul well product substanti process product knowledg gather follow element may includ stage number batch determin evalu critic materi attribut critic process paramet critic qualiti attribut vivo vitro correl estim inher process variabl ipv pac index process capabl qualiti dashboard pcqd enhanc control strategi u fda guidanc process valid gener principl practic januari encourag appli previou credibl experi suitabl similar product process complet stage evalu valuabl resourc product develop futur risk mitig similar product process element assess develop address industri regulatori guidanc requir conclus made provid suffici inform make scientif decis product robust assess methodolog process valid lifecycl stage
447,Bioequivalence requirements in the European Union: critical discussion.,"The aim of the present paper is to summarize the revised European Union (EU) Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence and to discuss critically with respect to previous European requirements and present US Food and Drug Administration guidelines its more relevant novelties such as the following: in order to facilitate the development of generic medicinal products, the EU guideline includes the eligibility for Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS)-based biowaivers not only for BCS class I drugs but also for class III drugs with tighter requirements for dissolution and excipient composition. The permeability criterion of BCS classification has been substituted with human absorbability, as per the Biopharmaceutical Drug Disposition Classification System. The widening of the acceptance range for C (max) is possible only for highly variable reference products with an additional clinical justification. This scaled widening is carried out with a proportionality constant of 0.760 which is more conservative than the FDA approach and maintains the consumer risk at a 5% level when the intra-subject CV is close to 30%, due to the smooth transition between the scaled and the constant criteria. The guideline allows for the possibility of two-stage designs to obtain the necessary information on formulation differences and variability from interim analyses as a part of the pivotal bioequivalence study, instead of undertaking pilot studies. The guideline also specifies that the statistical analyses should be performed considering all factors as fixed, which has implications in the case of replicate designs.",no keywords,The Aaps Journal,aim present paper summar revis european union eu guidelin investig bioequival discus critic respect previou european requir present u food drug administr guidelin relev novelti follow order facilit develop gener medicin product eu guidelin includ elig biopharmaceut classif system bc biowaiv bc class drug also class iii drug tighter requir dissolut excipi composit permeabl criterion bc classif substitut human absorb per biopharmaceut drug disposit classif system widen accept rang c max possibl highli variabl refer product addit clinic justif scale widen carri proportion constant conserv fda approach maintain consum risk level cv close due smooth transit scale constant criterion guidelin allow possibl design obtain necessari inform formul differ variabl interim analys part pivot bioequival studi instead undertak pilot studi guidelin also specifi statist analys perform consid factor fix implic case replic design bioequival requir european union critic discus

The agency receives reports from pharmaceutical companies, investigates causes, and disseminates information to pharmacies, healthcare providers, and the public. While focusing on mitigating shortages, the agency clarifies its non-involvement in manufacturing or sales decisions. Pharmaceutical companies must promptly report shortages, with sanctions enforced for non-compliance. Various measures, including regulatory actions, interchangeable medicines, temporary dispensations, and licensing, are employed to address shortages.

451,An accurate and nondestructive GC method for determination of cocaine on US paper currency.,"The presence of cocaine on US paper currency has been known for a long time. Banknotes become contaminated during the exchange, storage, and abuse of cocaine. The analysis of cocaine on various denominations of US banknotes in the general circulation can provide law enforcement circles and forensic epidemiologists objective and timely information on epidemiology of illicit drug use and on how to differentiate money contaminated in the general circulation from banknotes used in drug transaction. A simple, nondestructive, and accurate capillary gas chromatographic method has been developed for the determination of cocaine on various denominations of US banknotes in this study. The method comprises a fast ultrasonic extraction using water as a solvent followed by a SPE cleanup process with a C(18) cartridge and capillary GC separation, identification, and quantification. This nondestructive analytical method has been successfully applied to determine the cocaine contamination in US paper currency of all denominations. Standard calibration curve was linear over the concentration range from the LOQ (2.00 ng/mL) to 100 microg/mL and the RSD less than 2.0%. Cocaine was detected in 67% of the circulated banknotes collected in Southeastern Massachusetts in amounts ranging from approximately 2 ng to 49.4 microg per note. On average, $5, 10, 20, and 50 denominations contain higher amounts of cocaine than $1 and 100 denominations of US banknotes.",no keywords,Journal Of Separation Science,presenc cocain u paper currenc known long time banknot becom contamin exchang storag abus cocain analysi cocain variou denomin u banknot gener circul provid law enforc circl forens epidemiologist object time inform epidemiolog illicit drug use differenti money contamin gener circul banknot use drug transact simpl nondestruct accur capillari ga chromatograph method develop determin cocain variou denomin u banknot studi method compris fast ultrason extract use water solvent follow spe cleanup process c cartridg capillari gc separ identif quantif nondestruct analyt method success appli determin cocain contamin u paper currenc denomin standard calibr curv linear concentr rang loq rsd less cocain detect circul banknot collect southeastern massachusett amount rang approxim ng microg per note averag denomin contain higher amount cocain denomin u banknot accur nondestruct gc method determin cocain u paper currenc
452,Cyclic Oligosaccharide-Based Chiral Stationary Phases Applicable to Drug Purity Control; A Review.,"Oligosaccharide-based chiral stationary phases are frequently used for enantioselective separations by different chromatographic techniques, namely gas chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography, supercritical fluid chromatography or capillary electrochromatography. Their multimodal application potential (they are compatible with both polar and/or non-polar mobile phases) makes them suitable chiral selector candidates for separation of a wide variety of structurally diverse compounds. In this paper, separation systems utilizing cyclodextrin- or cyclofructan-based chiral stationary phases in analyses of pharmacologically active compounds are summarized. The review covers the period from 2000 to 2015. This review article can be helpful to analysts searching for an appropriate method for the separation/determination of pharmaceuticals of their interest.","cyclodextrin, chromatography, cyclofructan, drugs, enantioselectivity, enantioseparation, pharmaceuticals",Current Medicinal Chemistry,chiral stationari phase frequent use enantioselect separ differ chromatograph techniqu name ga chromatographi high perform liquid chromatographi supercrit fluid chromatographi capillari electrochromatographi multimod applic potenti compat polar mobil phase make suitabl chiral selector candid separ wide varieti structur diver compound paper separ system util chiral stationari phase analys pharmacolog activ compound summar review cover period review articl help analyst search appropri method pharmaceut interest cyclic chiral stationari phase applic drug puriti control review

454,Impact of excipient interactions on drug bioavailability from solid dosage forms.,"Excipients are generally pharmacologically inert, but can interact with drugs in the dosage form and the physiological factors at the site of absorption to affect the bioavailability of a drug product. A general mechanistic understanding of the basis of these interactions is essential to design robust drug products. This paper focuses on drug-excipient interactions in solid dosage forms that impact drug bioavailability, the drug substance and drug product properties affected by excipients, and the impact of excipients on physiologic processes. The extent to which drug bioavailability is affected by these interactions would vary on a case-by-case basis depending upon factors such as the potency and dose of the drug, therapeutic window, site of absorption, rate limiting factor in drug absorption (e.g., permeability or solubility limited), or whether drug metabolism, efflux, complexation, or degradation at the site of absorption play a role in determining its bioavailability. Nonetheless, a mechanistic understanding of drug-excipient interactions and their impact on drug release and absorption can help develop formulations that exhibit optimum drug bioavailability.",no keywords,Pharmaceutical Research,excipi gener pharmacolog inert interact drug dosag form physiolog factor site absorpt affect bioavail drug product gener mechanist understand basi interact essenti design robust drug product paper focus interact solid dosag form impact drug bioavail drug substanc drug product properti affect excipi impact excipi physiolog process extent drug bioavail affect interact would vari basi depend upon factor potenc dose drug therapeut window site absorpt rate limit factor drug absorpt permeabl solubl limit whether drug metabol efflux complex degrad site absorpt play role determin bioavail nonetheless mechanist understand interact impact drug releas absorpt help develop formul exhibit optimum drug bioavail impact excipi interact drug bioavail solid dosag form

456,The trip of a drug inside the body: From a lipid-based nanocarrier to a target cell.,"To date, enormous investigations have been conducted to enhance medicines' target-oriented delivery to improve their therapeutic index. In this regard, lipid-based carrier system might have been regarded as prime delivery systems that are very close to the naturally cell-derived vesicles used for biomolecular communication among cells from occasionally remote tissues. Upon examination of the literature, we found a chasm between groups of investigations in drug pharmaceutics and thought that maybe holistic research could provide better information with respect to drug delivery inside the body, especially when they are going to be injected directly into the bloodstream for systemic distribution. While a collection of older research in most cases dealt with the determination of drug partition coefficient between the aqueous and cell membrane compartments, the link has been overlooked in newer investigations that were mostly focused on drug formulation optimization and their association with particle biodistribution. This gap in the literature motivated us to present the current opinion paper, in which drug physicochemical properties like drug lipophilicity/hydrophilicity is considered as an important element in designing drug-carrying liposomes or micelles. How a hypothetical high throughput cell-embedded chromatographic technique might help to investigate a nanocarrier tissue distribution and to design 'multi-epitope grafted lipid-based drug carrier systems' are discussed. Whenever we would need support for our opinions, we have provided analogy from hydrophobic biomolecules like cholesterol, steroid hormones, and sex hormones and encouraged readers to consider our principle hypothesis: If these molecules could reach their targets far away from the site of production, then a large list of hydrophobic drugs could be delivered to their targets using the same principles.","drug partition coefficient, lipid-based particles, multi-epitope drug delivery system, protein corona, protein-protein interaction",Journal Of Controlled Release : Official Journal Of The Controlled Release Society,date enorm investig conduct enhanc medicin deliveri improv therapeut index regard carrier system might regard prime deliveri system close natur vesicl use biomolecular commun among cell occasion remot tissu upon examin literatur found chasm group investig drug pharmaceut thought mayb holist research could provid better inform respect drug deliveri insid bodi especi go inject directli bloodstream system distribut collect older research case dealt determin drug partit coeffici aqueou cell membran compart link overlook newer investig mostli focus drug formul optim associ particl biodistribut gap literatur motiv u present current opinion paper drug physicochem properti like drug consid import element design liposom micel hypothet high throughput chromatograph techniqu might help investig nanocarri tissu distribut design graft drug carrier system discus whenev would need support opinion provid analog hydrophob biomolecul like cholesterol steroid hormon sex hormon encourag reader consid principl hypothesi molecul could reach target far away site product larg list hydrophob drug could deliv target use principl trip drug insid bodi nanocarri target cell
457,Application of surfactants in the electrochemical sensing and biosensing of biomolecules and drug molecules.,"Realizing sensitive and efficient detection of biomolecules and drug molecules is of great significance. Among the detection methods that have been proposed, electrochemical sensing is favored for its outstanding advantages such as simple operation, low cost, fast response and high sensitivity. The unique structure and properties of surfactants have led to a wide range of applications in the field of electrochemical sensors and biosensors for biomolecules and drug molecules. Through the comparative analysis of reported works, this paper summarizes the application modes of surfactants in electrochemical sensors and biosensors for biomolecules and drug molecules, explores the possible electrocatalytic mechanism of their action, and looks forward to the development trend of their applications.

458,Formulation approaches in mitigating toxicity of orally administrated drugs.,"This paper provides an overview of current formulation approaches to mitigate toxicity of orally administrated drugs. The formulation approaches are characterized by their intended impact on a drug's pharmacokinetic parameters, pharmacological properties or metabolic pathways. Regulatory opportunities and constraints with focus on U.S. regulations in optimizing a drug's safety or efficacy profile are reviewed. The following formulation approaches are described: (i) pharmacokinetic-modulating and (ii) pharmacodynamic-modulating. In the pharmacokinetic-modulating approach, the pharmacokinetic profile of drug release is modified by, for example, a reduction in peak drug plasma concentration while preserving or improving AUC, thereby potentially reducing toxic effects that may be related to C(max). In the pharmacodynamic-modulating approach, the drug is co-dosed with pharmacologically active or nonpharmacologically active agent or agents intended for mitigation of the drug's toxicity. The pharmacodynamic-modulating approach requires information on the specificity of drug interactions with other compounds and also on metabolic pathways. Examples demonstrating successful formulation work in reducing drug toxicity are provided. The in-depth knowledge of the drug's PK and PD properties combined with a greater understanding of the biology of diseases are necessary for successful drug product formulation leading to optimized in vivo exposure and minimized toxicity.",no keywords,Pharmaceutical Development And Technology,paper provid overview current formul approach mitig toxic oral administr drug formul approach character intend impact drug pharmacokinet paramet pharmacolog properti metabol pathway regulatori opportun constraint focu regul optim drug safeti efficaci profil review follow formul approach describ ii approach pharmacokinet profil drug releas modifi exampl reduct peak drug plasma concentr preserv improv auc therebi potenti reduc toxic effect may relat c max approach drug pharmacolog activ nonpharmacolog activ agent agent intend mitig drug toxic approach requir inform specif drug interact compound also metabol pathway exampl demonstr success formul work reduc drug toxic provid knowledg drug pk pd properti combin greater understand biolog diseas necessari success drug product formul lead optim vivo exposur minim toxic formul approach mitig toxic oral administr drug

The question of whether TRIPS generates gains for developing countries, in the form of increased exports, is addressed in this paper through consideration of the importance of pharmaceuticals in health-care trade, outlining the essential requirements, implications, and issues related to TRIPS, and TRIPS-plus, in which increased restrictions are imposed as part of bilateral free-trade agreements. TRIPS has not generated substantial gains for developing countries, but has further increased pharmaceutical trade in developed countries. The unequal trade between developed and developing countries (ie, exporting and importing high-value patented drugs, respectively) raises the issue of access to medicines, which is exacerbated by TRIPS-plus provisions, although many countries have not even enacted provision for TRIPS flexibilities. Therefore this paper focuses on options that are available to the health community for negotiation to their advantage under TRIPS, and within the presence of TRIPS-plus.",no keywords,"Lancet (London, England)",world trade organ agreement aspect intellectu properti right trip set global minimum standard protect intellectu properti substanti increas expand right gener clear gain pharmaceut industri develop world question whether trip gener gain develop countri form increas export address paper consider import pharmaceut trade outlin essenti requir implic issu relat trip increas restrict impos part bilater agreement trip gener substanti gain develop countri increas pharmaceut trade develop countri unequ trade develop develop countri ie export import patent drug respect rais issu access medicin exacerb provis although mani countri even enact provis trip flexibl therefor paper focus option avail health commun negoti advantag trip within presenc trade trip pharmaceut

In this contribution, we show the production of cost-effective SERS sensors obtained by depositing Lee-Meisel Ag colloids on filter paper either by natural sedimentation or centrifugation. We have characterized the morphological and plasmonic features of the sensors by optical microscopy, SEM, and UV-Vis spectroscopy. Such sensors can be used to quantify by SERS the anti-epileptic drug Perampanel (in the concentration range 1 × 10<sup>-4</sup>-5 × 10<sup>-6</sup> M) by spinning them during the micro-Raman measurements on the top of a custom device obtained from spare part hard disk drives. This approach minimizes laser-induced heating effects and allows averaging over the spatial non-uniformity of the sensor.","lee-meisel colloids, perampanel, sers, spinning cell","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",applic ser therapeut drug monitor field analyt chemistri requir avail sensit sensor experiment approach implement afford way contribut show product ser sensor obtain deposit ag colloid filter paper either natur sediment centrifug character morpholog plasmon featur sensor optic microscopi sem spectroscopi sensor use quantifi ser drug perampanel concentr rang sup sup spin measur top custom devic obtain spare part hard disk drive approach minim heat effect allow averag spatial sensor sen drug perampanel spin ser substrat
461,An interesting relationship between drug absorption and melting point.,"The ability to predict the extent of passive intestinal drug absorption is very important for efficient lead candidate selection and development. Physicochemical-based absorption predictive models previously developed use solubility, partition coefficient and pK(a) as drug input parameters for intestinal absorption. Alternatively, this study looks at the relationship between melting point and passive transport for poorly soluble drugs. It is based entirely on the expression derived from the General Solubility Equation (GSE) that relates melting point to the product of intrinsic solubility and partition coefficient. Given that the melting point of a compound is one of the first and more reliable physical properties measured, it can be advantageously used as a guide in early drug discovery and development. This paper elucidates the interesting relationship between the melting point and dose to the fraction absorbed of poorly soluble drugs, i.e., class II and IV compounds in the Biopharmaceutics Classification System. The newly defined melting point based absorption potential (MPbAP) parameter is successful at distinguishing 90% of the 91 drugs considered being well absorbed (FA>0.5) or poorly absorbed. In general, lower melting compounds are more likely to be well absorbed than higher melting compounds for any given dose. The fraction absorbed for drugs with high melting temperatures is limited by the dose to a greater degree than it is for low melting compounds.",no keywords,International Journal Of Pharmaceutics,abil predict extent passiv intestin drug absorpt import effici lead candid select develop absorpt predict model previous develop use solubl partit coeffici pk drug input paramet intestin absorpt altern studi look relationship melt point passiv transport poorli solubl drug base entir express deriv gener solubl equat gse relat melt point product intrins solubl partit coeffici given melt point compound one first reliabl physic properti measur advantag use guid earli drug discoveri develop paper elucid interest relationship melt point dose fraction absorb poorli solubl drug class ii iv compound biopharmaceut classif system newli defin melt point base absorpt potenti mpbap paramet success distinguish drug consid well absorb fa poorli absorb gener lower melt compound like well absorb higher melt compound given dose fraction absorb drug high melt temperatur limit dose greater degre low melt compound interest relationship drug absorpt melt point

Recent genetic research has revealed that genetic polymorphisms are important intrinsic factors for these inter-individual differences. This pharmacogenomic information could help develop safer and more effective precision pharmacotherapies and thus, regulatory guidance/guidelines were developed in this area, especially in the EU and US. The Project for the Promotion of Progressive Medicine, Medical Devices, and Regenerative Medicine by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, performed by Tohoku University, reported scientific information on the evaluation of genetic polymorphisms, mainly on drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters, during non-clinical studies and phase I clinical trials in Japanese subjects/patients.

With the introduction of correlation parameters between the pharmacokinetic measures or between the random effects in the bioequivalence models, we observe a good improvement in the bioequivalence results. These results are of great practical interest since they can yield higher accuracy and reliability for the bioequivalence tests, usually assumed by regulatory offices.

465,Analysis of low active-pharmaceutical-ingredient signal drugs based on thin layer chromatography and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy.,"Active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) embedded in the excipients of the formula can usually be unravelled by normal Raman spectroscopy (NRS). However, more and more drugs with low API content and/or low Raman scattering coefficient were insensitive to NRS analysis, which was for the first time defined as Low API-Signal Drugs (LASIDs) in this paper. The NRS spectra of these LASIDs were similar to their dominant excipients' profiles, such as lactose, starch, microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), etc., and were classified into three types as such. 21 out of 100 kinds of drugs were screened as LASIDs and characterized further by Raman microscopic mapping. Accordingly, we proposed a tailored solution to the qualitation and quantitation problem of these LASIDs, using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopic (SERS) detection on the thin layer chromatographic (TLC) plate both in situ and after-separation. Experimental conditions and parameters including TLC support matrix, SERS substrate, detection mode, similarity threshold, internal standard, etc., were optimized. All LASIDs were satisfactorily identified and the quantitation results agreed well with those of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). For some structural analogues of LASIDs, although they presented highly similar SERS spectra and were tough to distinguish even with Raman microscopic mapping, they could be successfully discriminated from each other by coupling SERS (with portable Raman spectrometer) with TLC. These results demonstrated that the proposed solution could be employed to detect the LASIDs with high accuracy and cost-effectiveness.","low active-pharmaceutical-ingredient signal drugs, qualitation, quantitation, surface-enhanced raman spectroscopy, thin layer chromatography",Journal Of Pharmaceutical And Biomedical Analysis,activ pharmaceut ingredi api embed excipi formula usual unravel normal raman spectroscopi nr howev drug low api content low raman scatter coeffici insensit nr analysi first time defin low drug lasid paper nr spectrum lasid similar domin excipi profil lactos starch microcrystallin cellulos mcc classifi three type kind drug screen lasid character raman microscop map accordingli propos tailor solut qualit quantit problem lasid use raman spectroscop ser detect thin layer chromatograph tlc plate situ experiment condit paramet includ tlc support matrix ser substrat detect mode similar threshold intern standard optim lasid satisfactorili identifi quantit result agre well high perform liquid chromatographi hplc structur analogu lasid although present highli similar ser spectrum tough distinguish even raman microscop map could success discrimin coupl ser portabl raman spectromet tlc result demonstr propos solut could employ detect lasid high accuraci analysi low signal drug base thin layer chromatographi raman spectroscopi

Depth profiling of inks was performed on overlapping color bands on copy paper by repeatedly scanning the line with a pulsed laser beam operated at a fixed energy. The molecules in the ink on a banknote were desorbed by irradiating the banknote surface with a laser beam operated at different energies, with results indicating that different ions were detected at different depths. The analysis of authentic $US100, $100 RMB and $1000 NTD banknotes indicated that ions detected in 'color-shifting' and 'typography' regions were significantly different. Additionally, the abundances of some ions dramatically changed with the depth of the aforementioned regions. This approach was used to distinguish authentic $1000 NTD banknotes from counterfeits.

468,Degrees of order: A comparison of nanocrystal and amorphous solids for poorly soluble drugs.,"Poor aqueous solubility is currently a prevalent issue in the development of small molecule pharmaceuticals. Several methods are possible for improving the solubility, dissolution rate and bioavailability of Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) class II and class IV drugs. Two solid state approaches, which rely on reductions in order, and can theoretically be applied to all molecules without any specific chemical prerequisites (compared with e.g. ionizable or co-former groups, or sufficient lipophilicity), are the use of the amorphous form and nanocrystals. Research involving these two approaches is relatively extensive and commercial products are now available based on these technologies. Nevertheless, their formulation remains more challenging than with conventional dosage forms. This article describes these two technologies from both theoretical and practical perspectives by briefly discussing the physicochemical backgrounds behind these approaches, as well as the resulting practical implications, both positive and negative. Case studies demonstrating the benefits and challenges of these two techniques are presented.","amorphous, crystallinity, nanocrystals, poor solubility, solubility enhancement, supersaturation",International Journal Of Pharmaceutics,poor aqueou solubl current preval issu develop small molecul pharmaceut sever method possibl improv solubl dissolut rate bioavail biopharmaceut classif system bc class ii class iv drug two solid state approach reli reduct order theoret appli molecul without specif chemic prerequisit compar ioniz group suffici lipophil use amorph form nanocryst research involv two approach rel extens commerci product avail base technolog nevertheless formul remain challeng convent dosag form articl describ two technolog theoret practic perspect briefli discus physicochem background behind approach well result practic implic posit neg case studi demonstr benefit challeng two techniqu present degre order comparison nanocryst amorph solid poorli solubl drug
469,An informatics framework for the standardized collection and analysis of medication data in networked research.,"Medication exposure is an important variable in virtually all clinical research, yet there is great variation in how the data are collected, coded, and analyzed. Coding and classification systems for medication data are heterogeneous in structure, and there is little guidance for implementing them, especially in large research networks and multi-site trials. Current practices for handling medication data in clinical trials have emerged from the requirements and limitations of paper-based data collection, but there are now many electronic tools to enable the collection and analysis of medication data. This paper reviews approaches to coding medication data in multi-site research contexts, and proposes a framework for the classification, reporting, and analysis of medication data. The framework can be used to develop tools for classifying medications in coded data sets to support context appropriate, explicit, and reproducible data analyses by researchers and secondary users in virtually all clinical research domains.","data analysis, data coding, data coordinating centers, drug classification, medication terminological systems, standards",Journal Of Biomedical Informatics,medic exposur import variabl virtual clinic research yet great variat data collect code analyz code classif system medic data heterogen structur littl guidanc implement especi larg research network trial current practic handl medic data clinic trial emerg requir limit data collect mani electron tool enabl collect analysi medic data paper review approach code medic data research context propos framework classif report analysi medic data framework use develop tool classifi medic code data set support context appropri explicit reproduc data analys research secondari user virtual clinic research domain informat framework standard collect analysi medic data network research
470,Centrifugal Lithography: Self-Shaping of Polymer Microstructures Encapsulating Biopharmaceutics by Centrifuging Polymer Drops.,"Polymeric microstructures encapsulating biopharmaceutics must be fabricated in a controlled environment to preserve the biological activity. There is increasing demand for simple methods designed to preserve the biological activity by utilizing the natural properties of polymers. Here, the paper shows that centrifugal lithography (CL) can be used for the fabrication of such microstructures in a single centrifugation, by engineering the self-shaping properties of hyaluronic acid (HA). In this method, HA drops are self-shaped into hourglass-microstructures to produce two dissolving microneedles (DMN), which facilitate transdermal delivery via implantation on the skin. In addition, tuberculin purified protein derivatives are encapsulated into HA DMNs under refrigerated conditions (4 °C) during CL. Therefore, the tuberculin skin test (TST) with the DMNs indicates minimal damage, as opposed to the case of TST with traditional hypodermic needles. These findings on the fabrication of polymeric microstructures with biopharmaceutics may trigger the development of various biomedical devices and therapies.","biopharmaceutics, centrifugal lithography, microneedles, self-shaping",Advanced Healthcare Materials,polymer microstructur encapsul biopharmaceut must fabric control environ preserv biolog activ increas demand simpl method design preserv biolog activ util natur properti polym paper show centrifug lithographi cl use fabric microstructur singl centrifug engin properti hyaluron acid ha method ha drop produc two dissolv microneedl dmn facilit transderm deliveri via implant skin addit tuberculin purifi protein deriv encapsul ha dmn refriger condit cl therefor tuberculin skin test tst dmn indic minim damag oppos case tst tradit hypoderm needl find fabric polymer microstructur biopharmaceut may trigger develop variou biomed devic therapi centrifug lithographi polym microstructur encapsul biopharmaceut centrifug polym drop

472,Safety assessment of drug impurities for patient safety: A comprehensive review.,"Drug impurities are undesirable but unavoidable chemicals which can occur throughout the drug life cycle. The safety implications of drug impurities can be significant given that they can impact safety, quality, and efficacy of drug products and that certain drug impurities are mutagenic, carcinogenic, or teratogenic. The characteristics of drug impurities could be specific to drug modalities (e.g., small molecules vs. biologics). The commonly encountered drug impurities include elemental impurity, residual solvent, organic impurity, host cell protein and DNA, residual viral vector, extractable and leachable, and particle. They can cause various adverse effects such as immunogenicity, infection, genotoxicity, and carcinogenicity upon significant exposure. Therefore, the effective control of these drug impurities is central for patient safety. Regulations and guidelines are available for drug developers to manage them. Their qualification is obtained based on authoritative qualification thresholds or safety assessment following the classic toxicological risk assessment. The current review focuses on the safety assessment science and methodology used for diverse types of drug impurities. Due to the different nature of diverse drug impurities, their safety assessment represents a significant challenge for drug developers.","drug product, impurity, patient safety, safety assessment",Regulatory Toxicology And Pharmacology : Rtp,drug impur undesir unavoid chemic occur throughout drug life cycl safeti implic drug impur signific given impact safeti qualiti efficaci drug product certain drug impur mutagen carcinogen teratogen characterist drug impur could specif drug modal small molecul biolog commonli encount drug impur includ element impur residu solvent organ impur host cell protein dna residu viral vector extract leachabl particl caus variou advers effect immunogen infect genotox carcinogen upon signific exposur therefor effect control drug impur central patient safeti regul guidelin avail drug develop manag qualif obtain base authorit qualif threshold safeti assess follow classic toxicolog risk assess current review focus safeti assess scienc methodolog use diver type drug impur due differ natur diver drug impur safeti assess repres signific challeng drug develop safeti assess drug impur patient safeti comprehens review
473,Optimizing the Electron-Withdrawing Character on Benzenesulfonyl Moiety Attached to a Glyco-Conjugate to Impart Sensitive and Selective Sensing of Cyanide in HEPES Buffer and on Cellulose Paper and Silica Gel Strips.,"Dansyl-derivatized, triazole-linked, glucopyranosyl conjugates, (5F)LOH, (2F)LOH, (1F)LOH, and (0F)LOH were synthesized and characterized. While the (5F)LOH acts as a molecular probe for CN(-), (2F)LOH, (1F)LOH, and (0F)LOH acts as control molecules. The reactivity of CN(-) toward (5F)LOH has been elicited through the changes observed in NMR, ESI MS, emission, and absorption spectroscopy. The conjugate (5F)LOH releases a fluorescent product upon reaction by CN(-) in aqueous acetonitrile medium by exhibiting an ∼125-fold fluorescence enhancement even in the presence of other anions. Fluorescence switch-on behavior has been clearly demonstrated on the basis of the nucleophilic substitution reaction of CN(-) on (5F)LOH. A minimum detection limit of (2.3 ± 0.3) × 10(-7) M (6 ± 1 ppb) was shown by (5F)LOH for CN(-) in solution. All the other anions studied showed no change in the fluorescence emission. The utility of (5F)LOH has been demonstrated by showing its reactivity toward CN(-) on a thin layer of silica gel as well as on Whatman No. 1 cellulose filter paper strips. The role of glucose moiety and the penta-fluorobenzenesulfonyl reactive center present in (5F)LOH in the selectivity of CN(-) over other anions has been demonstrated by fluorescence, absorption and thermodynamics study. Similar studies carried out with the control molecules showed no selectivity for CN(-).

474,A disposable and sensitive non-enzymatic glucose sensor based on 3D graphene/Cu<sub>2</sub>O modified carbon paper electrode.,"Herein, a three-dimensional graphene wall (GWs) and nano-Cu<sub>2</sub>O modified carbon fiber paper (CFP) electrode were used to develop a disposable and sensitive non-enzymatic glucose sensor. This sensing interface of GWs/Cu<sub>2</sub>O consists of an interlaced CFP on which intercrossed graphene walls (GWs) were vertically tethered in situ by radio frequency plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (RF-PECVD), and Cu<sub>2</sub>O nanoparticles (NPs) were evenly grew on the 3D GWs layer and skeleton through the complete thermal decomposition of copper acetate (Cu (CH<sub>3</sub>COO)<sub>2</sub>) at high temperature. The CFP/GWs/Cu<sub>2</sub>O shows a large specific surface area and rich solution diffusion channels, which can expose more catalytic active sites without Nafion fixation film, thus greatly improving the electrocatalytic performance of this glucose sensor. The CFP/GWs/Cu<sub>2</sub>O sensor shows excellent catalytic performance to glucose with a linear detection range of 0.5 μM-5166 μM, LOD of 0.21 μM, and response time <4 s.

475,European Paediatric Formulation Initiative workshop report: Improving the administration of oral liquid medicines in paediatrics using dosing syringes and enteral accessories.,"Accurate dosing of the right medicine to the right patient is a key element of safe and efficacious pharmacotherapy, yet prone to technical challenges and human error when dosing involves the administration of small volumes of liquid medicines. For this reason, the topic has gained increased attention over the last decade from multiple stakeholder parties e.g. academia, hospital pharmacy, the medical device and pharmaceutical industry, and regulatory agencies. It is now well acknowledged that spoons and cups are not suitable for the measurement of small volumes of oral liquid medicines and that syringes are a better alternative, but syringes for parenteral use should not be used for oral dosing in order to avoid accidental parenteral delivery of oral products. However, dosing accuracy of very small volumes of liquid medicines to young children, and especially pre-term neonates, is still not sufficiently ensured. A workshop was organised in 2018 by the European Paediatric Formulation Initiative to reflect on current status and challenges (first part) and possible strategies to improve the present situation (second part). A voting system (n = 24) was used to consider the most favourable solutions. The harmonisation and/or standardisation of the technical design of oral syringes (including e.g. female/male connection) was considered a key priority.","administration oral, dosing accuracy, drug development, ema, infant, medical device, medication error, medication safety, newborn, paediatric",European Journal Of Pharmaceutics And Biopharmaceutics : Official Journal Of Arbeitsgemeinschaft Fur Pharmazeutische Verfahrenstechnik E.V,accur dose right medicin right patient key element safe efficaci pharmacotherapi yet prone technic challeng human error dose involv administr small volum liquid medicin reason topic gain increas attent last decad multipl stakehold parti academia hospit pharmaci medic devic pharmaceut industri regulatori agenc well acknowledg spoon cup suitabl measur small volum oral liquid medicin syring better altern syring parenter use use oral dose order avoid accident parenter deliveri oral product howev dose accuraci small volum liquid medicin young child especi neonat still suffici ensur workshop organis european paediatr formul initi reflect current statu challeng first part possibl strategi improv present situat second part vote system n use consid favour solut harmonis standardis technic design oral syring includ connect consid key prioriti european paediatr formul initi workshop report improv administr oral liquid medicin paediatr use dose syring enter accessori
476,Sequential processing strategies for fingermark visualisation on uncirculated £10 (Bank of England) polymer banknotes.,"An investigation was undertaken to assess the relative effectiveness of five fingermark visualisation process sequences on new, uncirculated £10 polymer banknotes from the Bank of England (BoE). Each sequence was challenged with the visualisation of 64 natural fingermarks on eight banknotes, of which half were aged for 2-3days and half were aged for 12-13days (32 donors contributed in each set). The sequences investigated were; After each process was applied, fingermark development was assessed under primary viewing conditions appropriate to the technique (white light or fluorescence). All samples were also assessed under secondary viewing conditions; provided by the optical processes infrared reflection and long-wave ultraviolet reflection, and by gelatin lifting (with scanning). These additional techniques reduced the interfering effect of the complex banknote backgrounds and improved the contrast of enhanced fingermarks. Overall, with all assessment conditions considered, sequence 4 and sequence 3 visualised the most identifiable quality fingermarks (92.2% and 89.1% respectively). The most effective overall process used singularly was found to be black magnetic powder, provided that reflected infrared was used to image the results (82.8%). Further data analysis revealed that sequence 1 was the most effective sequence for fresh marks (aged 2-3days) when only primary viewing conditions within the visible part of the spectrum are considered. The need for further work which considers the sensitivity of the processes, and how they perform on BoE polymer banknotes that have become worn in circulation, is emphasised.","fingermark, gelatin lifting, infrared, polymer banknote, ultraviolet",Forensic Science International,investig undertaken assess rel effect five fingermark visualis process sequenc new uncircul polym banknot bank england boe sequenc challeng visualis natur fingermark eight banknot half age half age donor contribut set sequenc investig process appli fingermark develop assess primari view condit appropri techniqu white light fluoresc sampl also assess secondari view condit provid optic process infrar reflect ultraviolet reflect gelatin lift scan addit techniqu reduc interf effect complex banknot background improv contrast enhanc fingermark overal assess condit consid sequenc sequenc visualis identifi qualiti fingermark respect effect overal process use singularli found black magnet powder provid reflect infrar use imag result data analysi reveal sequenc effect sequenc fresh mark age primari view condit within visibl part spectrum consid need work consid sensit process perform boe polym banknot becom worn circul emphasis sequenti process strategi fingermark visualis uncircul bank england polym banknot

This review discusses this tedious part of bioanalytical studies, applied to large-scale samples and using liquid chromatography coupled with different detector types as core analytical technique. The main sample preparation methods included in this paper are protein precipitation, liquid-liquid extraction, solid-phase extraction, derivatization and their versions. They are discussed by analytical performances, fields of applications, advantages and disadvantages.

478,Do Drug-likeness Rules Apply to Oral Prodrugs?,"This paper describes a comparative analysis of the physicochemical and structural properties of prodrugs and their corresponding drugs with regard to drug-likeness rules. The dataset used in this work was obtained from the DrugBank. Sixty-five pairs of prodrugs/drugs were retrieved and divided into the following categories: carrier-linked to increase hydrophilic character, carrier-linked to increase absorption, and bioprecursors. We compared the physicochemical properties related to drug-likeness between prodrugs and drugs. Our results show that prodrugs do not always follow Lipinski's Rule of 5, especially as we observed 15 prodrugs with more than 10 hydrogen bond acceptors and 18 with a molecular weight greater than 500 Da. This fact highlights the importance of extending Lipinski's rules to encompass other parameters as both strategies (filtering of drug-like chemical libraries and prodrug design) aim to improve the bioavailability of compounds. Therefore, critical reasoning is fundamental to determine whether a structure has drug-like properties or could be considered a potential orally active compound in the drug-design pipeline.","computational adme, drug-like properties, oral absorption, physicochemical properties, prodrugs",Chemmedchem,paper describ compar analysi physicochem structur properti prodrug correspond drug regard rule dataset use work obtain drugbank pair retriev divid follow categori increas hydrophil charact increas absorpt bioprecursor compar physicochem properti relat prodrug drug result show prodrug alway follow lipinski rule especi observ prodrug hydrogen bond acceptor molecular weight greater da fact highlight import extend lipinski rule encompass paramet strategi filter chemic librari prodrug design aim improv bioavail compound therefor critic reason fundament determin whether structur properti could consid potenti oral activ compound pipelin rule appli oral prodrug
479,Pronounced effect of lamination on plasma separation from whole blood by microfluidic paper-based analytical devices.,"Many diseases are detected through blood tests. Currently, most blood tests are done on plasma instead of whole blood because of the interference of blood cells on detection results. Here, we developed a laminated microfluidic paper-based analytical device (L-μPAD) for the separation of plasma from whole blood without using plasma separation membrane (PSM). A lateral flow design consisting of a circular sampling zone and rectangular detection zone was patterned on the paper substrate using laser printing technology. The μPAD was then laminated after impregnation with KCl solution. Lamination and electrolyte addition represented synergistic effects on the separation by controlling the pore size of the paper. In addition, by preventing evaporation on one hand and squeezing paper pores on the other hand, lamination caused longer movement of the separated plasma, the longest plasma path reported so far. The separation process was monitored using colorimetric reagent bromocresol green and scanning electron microscopy. The process of separation was completed in less than 90s without significant hemolysis and the separated plasma was far from the interfering effect of red blood cells. We used the device for the determination of serum albumin. However, it represents the potential for point-of-care testing in multi-assay experiments too.","albumin, blood test, lamination, paper microfluidic, plasma separation",Analytica Chimica Acta,mani diseas detect blood test current blood test done plasma instead whole blood interfer blood cell detect result develop lamin microfluid analyt devic separ plasma whole blood without use plasma separ membran psm later flow design consist circular sampl zone rectangular detect zone pattern paper substrat use laser print technolog μpad lamin impregn kcl solut lamin electrolyt addit repres synergist effect separ control pore size paper addit prevent evapor one hand squeez paper pore hand lamin caus longer movement separ plasma longest plasma path report far separ process monitor use colorimetr reagent bromocresol green scan electron microscopi process separ complet less without signific hemolysi separ plasma far interf effect red blood cell use devic determin serum albumin howev repres potenti test experi pronounc effect lamin plasma separ whole blood microfluid analyt devic
480,Recent advances in lab-on-paper diagnostic devices using blood samples.,"Lab-on-paper, or microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (μPADs), use paper as a substrate material, and are patterned with a system of microchannels, reaction zones and sensing elements to perform analysis and detection. The sample transfer in such devices is performed by capillary action. As a result, external driving forces are not required, and hence the size and cost of the device are significantly reduced. Lab-on-paper devices have thus attracted significant attention for point-of-care medical diagnostic purposes in recent years, particularly in less-developed regions of the world lacking medical resources and infrastructures. This review discusses the major advances in lab-on-paper technology for blood analysis and diagnosis in the past five years. The review focuses particularly on the many clinical applications of lab-on-paper devices, including diabetes diagnosis, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) detection, kidney function diagnosis, liver function diagnosis, cholesterol and triglyceride (TG) analysis, sickle-cell disease (SCD) and phenylketonuria (PKU) analysis, virus analysis, C-reactive protein (CRP) analysis, blood ion analysis, cancer factor analysis, and drug analysis. The review commences by introducing the basic transmission principles, fabrication methods, structural characteristics, detection techniques, and sample pretreatment process of modern lab-on-paper devices. A comprehensive review of the most recent applications of lab-on-paper devices to the diagnosis of common human diseases using blood samples is then presented.

Unfortunately, there are still some barriers limiting the large-scale deployment of these innovative technologies in the healthcare field. Among these, the evaluation of potential thermal and non-thermal effects due to the exposure of biopharmaceutical products to electromagnetic fields is very challenging, but still slightly investigated. This paper aims to setup a controlled RF exposure environment, in order to reproduce a worst-case exposure of pharmaceutical products to the electromagnetic fields generated by the UHF RFID devices placed along the supply chain. Radiated powers several times higher than recommended by current normative limits were applied (10 W and 20 W). The electric field strength at the exposed sample location, used in tests, was as high as 100 V/m. Non-thermal effects were evaluated by chromatography techniques and in vitro assays.

483,Streamlined approach to high-quality purification and identification of compound series using high-resolution MS and NMR.,"Automated medicinal chemistry (parallel chemistry) has become an integral part of the drug-discovery process in almost every large pharmaceutical company. Parallel array synthesis of individual organic compounds has been used extensively to generate diverse structural libraries to support different phases of the drug-discovery process, such as hit-to-lead, lead finding, or lead optimization. In order to guarantee effective project support, efficiency in the production of compound libraries has been maximized. As a consequence, also throughput in chromatographic purification and analysis has been adapted. As a recent trend, more laboratories are preparing smaller, yet more focused libraries with even increasing demands towards quality, i.e. optimal purity and unambiguous confirmation of identity. This paper presents an automated approach how to combine effective purification and structural conformation of a lead optimization library created by microwave-assisted organic synthesis. The results of complementary analytical techniques such as UHPLC-HRMS and NMR are not only regarded but even merged for fast and easy decision making, providing optimal quality of compound stock.

484,Effective exposure of chemicals in in vitro cell systems: A review of chemical distribution models.,"Nominal effect concentrations from in vitro toxicity assays may lead to inaccurate estimations of in vivo toxic doses because the nominal concentration poorly reflects the concentration at the molecular target in cells in vitro, which is responsible for initiating effects and can be referred to as the biologically effective dose. Chemicals can differentially distribute between in vitro assay compartments, including serum constituents in exposure medium, microtitre plate plastic, headspace and extracellular matrices. The partitioning of test chemicals to these extracellular compartments reduces the concentration at the molecular target. Free concentrations in medium and cell-associated concentrations are considered better proxies of the biologically effective dose. This paper reviews the mechanisms by which test chemicals distribute between in vitro assay compartments, and also lists the physicochemical properties driving the extent of this distribution. The mechanisms and physicochemical properties driving the distribution of test chemical in vitro help explain the makeup of mass balance models that estimate free concentrations and cell-associated concentrations in in vitro toxicity assays. A thorough understanding of the distribution processes and assumptions underlying these mass balance models helps define chemical and biological applicability domains of individual models, as well as provide a perspective on how to improve model predictivity and quantitative in vitro-in vivo extrapolations.","qivive, free concentration, in vitro assays, mass balance, partitioning, pharmacokinetics",Toxicology In Vitro : An International Journal Published In Association With Bibra,nomin effect concentr vitro toxic assay may lead inaccur estim vivo toxic dose nomin concentr poorli reflect concentr molecular target cell vitro respons initi effect refer biolog effect dose chemic differenti distribut vitro assay compart includ serum constitu exposur medium microtitr plate plastic headspac extracellular matric partit test chemic extracellular compart reduc concentr molecular target free concentr medium concentr consid better proxi biolog effect dose paper review mechan test chemic distribut vitro assay compart also list physicochem properti drive extent distribut mechan physicochem properti drive distribut test chemic vitro help explain makeup mass balanc model estim free concentr concentr vitro toxic assay thorough understand distribut process assumpt underli mass balanc model help defin chemic biolog applic domain individu model well provid perspect improv model predict quantit vivo extrapol effect exposur chemic vitro cell system review chemic distribut model
485,Novel analytical solutions for convolution in compartmental pharmacokinetic models and application to non-bioequivalent formulations.,"Deconvolution and convolution are powerful tools that allow decomposition and reconstruction, respectively, of plasma versus time profiles from input and impulse functions. While deconvolution have commonly used compartmental approaches (e.g., Wagner-Nelson or Loo-Riegelman), convolution most typically used the convolution integral which can be solved with numerical methods. In 2005, an analytical solution for one-compartment pharmacokinetic was proposed and has been widely used ever since. However, to the best of our knowledge, analytical solutions for drugs distributed in more than one compartment have not been reported yet. In this paper, analytical solutions for compartmental convolution from both original and exact Loo-Riegelman approaches were developed and evaluated for different scenarios. While convolution from original approach was slightly more precise than that from the exact Loo-Riegelman, both methods were extremely accurate for reconstruction of plasma profiles after respective deconvolutions. Nonetheless, convolution from exact Loo-Riegelman was easier to interpret and to be manipulated mathematically. In fact, convolution solutions for three and more compartments can be easily written with this approach. Finally, our convolution analytical solution was applied to predict the failure in bioequivalence for levonorgestrel, demonstrating that equations in this paper may be useful tools for pharmaceutical scientists.","analytical solution, bioinequivalence, convolution, correlation, deconvolution, levonorgestrel, loo riegelman",European Journal Of Pharmaceutical Sciences : Official Journal Of The European Federation For Pharmaceutical Sciences,deconvolut convolut power tool allow decomposit reconstruct respect plasma versu time profil input impuls function deconvolut commonli use compartment approach convolut typic use convolut integr solv numer method analyt solut pharmacokinet propos wide use ever sinc howev best knowledg analyt solut drug distribut one compart report yet paper analyt solut compartment convolut origin exact approach develop evalu differ scenario convolut origin approach slightli precis exact method extrem accur reconstruct plasma profil respect deconvolut nonetheless convolut exact easier interpret manipul mathemat fact convolut solut three compart easili written approach final convolut analyt solut appli predict failur bioequival levonorgestrel demonstr equat paper may use tool pharmaceut scientist novel analyt solut convolut compartment pharmacokinet model applic formul

According to their purposes, three categories of portable medicine chests could be identified: Portable medicine chests owned by physicians or veterinarians in the cities, portable medicine chests established by the Department of Workers Health Insurance, and portable medicine chests of the Health Cooperatives that operated in the villages This paper analyzes all three types of portable medicine chests. We specifically examine the regulations concerning the management of portable medicine chests, their content, and supply chains of medicines from the third decade of the 19 th century through the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. We conclude that portable medicine chests represent a specific type of pharmacy in the territory of Serbia that provided very effective medical service. The medicines in these pharmacies were handled and dispensed to patients by physicians not by pharmacists. Patent medicines, compounded medicines, sanitary items and bandage materials were dispensed as well. Future research is needed to ascertain if physicians who owned or worked with the portable medicine chests actually prepared and compounded simple preparations as they were specified in the laws.",no keywords,Die Pharmazie,first portabl medicin chest appear serbia immedi liber ottoman rule around network portabl medicin chest grew quickli becam first effect public health method suppli medicin medic item peopl live citi without commun pharmaci rural popul villag accord purpos three categori portabl medicin chest could identifi portabl medicin chest own physician veterinarian citi portabl medicin chest establish depart worker health insur portabl medicin chest health cooper oper villag paper analyz three type portabl medicin chest specif examin regul concern manag portabl medicin chest content suppli chain medicin third decad th centuri first half sup th centuri conclud portabl medicin chest repres specif type pharmaci territori serbia provid effect medic servic medicin pharmaci handl dispens patient physician pharmacist patent medicin compound medicin sanitari item bandag materi dispens well futur research need ascertain physician own work portabl medicin chest actual prepar compound simpl prepar specifi law portabl medicin chest suppli medicin serbia sup th centuri analysi medicin list
487,Scattering orthogonalization of near-infrared spectra for analysis of pharmaceutical tablets.,"The paper explores scattering orthogonalization as a preprocessing technique to reduce physical interference and maintain chemical information in near-infrared (NIR) spectra of pharmaceutical tablets. Samples used in this study were tablets compressed at five compression forces; they were composed of theophylline, lactose, and microcrystalline cellulose (PH200). The NIR spectra were orthogonalized against the reduced scattering coefficients (representative of physical interference of scattering), and concentrations of all constituents were predicted. The robustness of predictions was compared to the widely employed standard normal variate (SNV) for the specificity of removing interference representative of physical parameter (such as tablet density). Group-wise cross-validation (groups were based upon similar chemical composition) and prediction demonstrated the enhanced robustness on prediction of chemical information via scattering orthogonalization in comparison to SNV. When compared to the SNV, scattering orthogonalization demonstrated an improved capacity to reduce physical interference while maintaining spectral variance attributable to chemical information. The improved capacity is expected to be useful for spectroscopy-based multivariate model calibration and continuous model update.",no keywords,Analytical Chemistry,paper explor scatter orthogon preprocess techniqu reduc physic interfer maintain chemic inform nir spectrum pharmaceut tablet sampl use studi tablet compress five compress forc compos theophyllin lactos microcrystallin cellulos nir spectrum orthogon reduc scatter coeffici repres physic interfer scatter concentr constitu predict robust predict compar wide employ standard normal variat snv specif remov interfer repres physic paramet tablet densiti group base upon similar chemic composit predict demonstr enhanc robust predict chemic inform via scatter orthogon comparison snv compar snv scatter orthogon demonstr improv capac reduc physic interfer maintain spectral varianc attribut chemic inform improv capac expect use multivari model calibr continu model updat scatter orthogon spectrum analysi pharmaceut tablet

490,Improving ADMET Prediction Accuracy for Candidate Drugs: Factors to Consider in QSPR Modeling Approaches.,"Quantitative Structure-Property Relationship (QSPR) employs mathematical and statistical methods to reveal quantitative correlations between the pharmacokinetics of compounds and their molecular structures, as well as their physical and chemical properties. QSPR models have been widely applied in the prediction of drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET). However, the accuracy of QSPR models for predicting drug ADMET properties still needs improvement. Therefore, this paper comprehensively reviews the tools employed in various stages of QSPR predictions for drug ADMET. It summarizes commonly used approaches to building QSPR models, systematically analyzing the advantages and limitations of each modeling method to ensure their judicious application. We provide an overview of recent advancements in the application of QSPR models for predicting drug ADMET properties. Furthermore, this review explores the inherent challenges in QSPR modeling while also proposing a range of considerations aimed at enhancing model prediction accuracy. The objective is to enhance the predictive capabilities of QSPR models in the field of drug development and provide valuable reference and guidance for researchers in this domain.","admet, accuracy., modeling approaches, molecular descriptors, prediction, qspr",Current Topics In Medicinal Chemistry,quantit relationship qspr employ mathemat statist method reveal quantit correl pharmacokinet compound molecular structur well physic chemic properti qspr model wide appli predict drug absorpt distribut metabol excret toxic admet howev accuraci qspr model predict drug admet properti still need improv therefor paper comprehens review tool employ variou stage qspr predict drug admet summar commonli use approach build qspr model systemat analyz advantag limit model method ensur judici applic provid overview recent advanc applic qspr model predict drug admet properti furthermor review explor inher challeng qspr model also propos rang consider aim enhanc model predict accuraci object enhanc predict capabl qspr model field drug develop provid valuabl refer guidanc research domain improv admet predict accuraci candid drug factor consid qspr model approach
491,"Electrophoretic deposition of biological macromolecules, drugs, and cells.","The use of biological entities in biotechnology and the biomedical field is of great interest as the biocompatibility and the functionality of naturally occurring is usually higher compared to other biomaterials, for example, synthetic polymers. Processing of natural biomolecules, including proteins like collagen and also living cells and bacteria, to develop medical devices, bioactive coatings, functionalized implants, tissue scaffolds, or biosensors, is however challenging. Electrophoretic deposition, a technique that takes advantage of the presence of charged particles or molecules in suitable solvents, is a low-temperature process suitable for manipulating a wide range of biomolecules and biological entities preserving their bioactivity, which could be otherwise lost by processing at high temperatures. Another advantage of EPD is the possibility to use aqueous suspensions to process biological entities given that organic solvents also could lead to degradation of biomolecules. This paper gives an overview of the available literature on the application of EPD to process different biomolecules and biological entities, like proteins, bacteria cells, hyaluronic acid, and therapeutic drugs, aiming at using such biomaterials in numerous applications ranging from biosensors to orthopedic implants, tissue scaffolds, and drug delivery devices.",no keywords,Biomacromolecules,use biolog entiti biotechnolog biomed field great interest biocompat function natur occur usual higher compar biomateri exampl synthet polym process natur biomolecul includ protein like collagen also live cell bacteria develop medic devic bioactiv coat function implant tissu scaffold biosensor howev challeng electrophoret deposit techniqu take advantag presenc charg particl molecul suitabl solvent process suitabl manipul wide rang biomolecul biolog entiti preserv bioactiv could otherwis lost process high temperatur anoth advantag epd possibl use aqueou suspens process biolog entiti given organ solvent also could lead degrad biomolecul paper give overview avail literatur applic epd process differ biomolecul biolog entiti like protein bacteria cell hyaluron acid therapeut drug aim use biomateri numer applic rang biosensor orthoped implant tissu scaffold drug deliveri devic electrophoret deposit biolog macromolecul drug cell

493,Prospectives of Solid Self-microemulsifying Systems in Novel Drug Delivery.,"More than 60% of the new drug molecules are lipophilic in nature. Low aqueous solubility and thus poor bioavailability is the main issue for these drugs for successful formulations into oral dosage form. Self-microemulsifying drug delivery systems (SMEDDS) have gained much attention. These are isotropic mixtures of different components (oil, surfactant and cosurfactant) that quickly disperse in gastrointestinal fluid yielding micro/nano-emulsions. These systems contain solubilized drug that is absorbed by lymphatic pathway along with other pathways like diffusion, collisional transfer, intracellular junctions, biliary acid pathway (BA), biliary acid mixed micelles pathway (BAMM) etc. and thus hepatic first pass metabolism is reduced. Stability of conventional SEDDS is considered very high with reference to other drug delivery systems as liposome, nanoparticles, nanoemulsion and micro emulsion. In fact SEDDS does not contain water in their composition which enhances their chemical and physical stability. Very few works have studied the stability of conventional SEDDS as it was confirmed. The major drawback for conventional SEDDS could be- i) high manufacturing cost (as they have to be filled in soft gelatin capsules); ii) interaction of capsule shell components with SEDDS. Therefore, attention has been given to transform liquid into solid SMEDDS by several techniques such as spray drying, spray cooling, super critical fluid technology and using adsorption carriers. Adsorption using solid carriers (Neusilin, Fujicalin, and dextran) is the successful inexpensive technique at initial research level whereas other requires expensive instrumentation.","adsorption, carrier, co-surfactant, fujicalin, neusilin, self-emulsification",Current Drug Delivery,new drug molecul lipophil natur low aqueou solubl thu poor bioavail main issu drug success formul oral dosag form drug deliveri system smedd gain much attent isotrop mixtur differ compon oil surfact cosurfact quickli dispers gastrointestin fluid yield system contain solubil drug absorb lymphat pathway along pathway like diffus collision transfer intracellular junction biliari acid pathway ba biliari acid mix micel pathway bamm etc thu hepat first pas metabol reduc stabil convent sedd consid high refer drug deliveri system liposom nanoparticl nanoemuls micro emuls fact sedd contain water composit enhanc chemic physic stabil work studi stabil convent sedd confirm major drawback convent sedd could high manufactur cost fill soft gelatin capsul ii interact capsul shell compon sedd therefor attent given transform liquid solid smedd sever techniqu spray dri spray cool super critic fluid technolog use adsorpt carrier adsorpt use solid carrier neusilin fujicalin dextran success inexpens techniqu initi research level wherea requir expens instrument prospect solid system novel drug deliveri
494,"Preparation, characterization and optimization of nanocellulose whiskers by simultaneously ultrasonic wave and microwave assisted.","Simultaneously ultrasonic wave and microwave assisted technique (SUMAT), as a method of process intensification, was first applied to the preparation of nanocellulose whiskers (NCWs) from filter paper by sulfuric acid hydrolysis. The effects of temperature, sulfuric acid concentration, and mass of raw material and time on the yield of NCWs were investigated by single-factor experiments, and the preparation conditions were optimized with response surface methodology. The obtained NCWs were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and thermal gravimetry. The results showed NCWs were facilely prepared by using SUMAT. However, some harsh reaction conditions such as high temperature, strong acidity and long time treatment easily induced the reduction of the yield of NCWs. Under the optimal conditions, the yield and the crystallinity of NCWs with the crystal form of cellulose Iα is 85.75% and 80%, respectively.","microwave, nanocellulose whiskers, response surface methodology, ultrasonic wave",Bioresource Technology,simultan ultrason wave microwav assist techniqu sumat method process intensif first appli prepar nanocellulos whisker ncw filter paper sulfur acid hydrolysi effect temperatur sulfur acid concentr mass raw materi time yield ncw investig experi prepar condit optim respons surfac methodolog obtain ncw character transmiss electron microscopi fourier transform infrar spectroscopi diffract thermal gravimetri result show ncw facil prepar use sumat howev harsh reaction condit high temperatur strong acid long time treatment easili induc reduct yield ncw optim condit yield crystallin ncw crystal form cellulos iα respect prepar character optim nanocellulos whisker simultan ultrason wave microwav assist
495,Immobilized aptamer paper spray ionization source for ion mobility spectrometry.,"A selective thin-film microextraction based on aptamer immobilized on cellulose paper was used as a paper spray ionization source for ion mobility spectrometry (PSI-IMS), for the first time. In this method, the paper is not only used as an ionization source but also it is utilized for the selective extraction of analyte, based on immobilized aptamer. This combination integrates both sample preparation and analyte ionization in a Whatman paper. To that end, an appropriate sample introduction system with a novel design was constructed for the paper spray ionization source. Using this system, a continuous solvent flow works as an elution and spray solvent simultaneously. In this method, analyte is adsorbed on a triangular paper with immobilized aptamer and then it is desorbed and ionized by elution solvent and applied high voltage on paper, respectively. The effects of different experimental parameters such as applied voltage, angle of paper tip, distance between paper tip and counter electrode, elution solvent type, and solvent flow rate were optimized. The proposed method was exhaustively validated in terms of sensitivity and reproducibility by analyzing the standard solutions of codeine and acetamiprid. The analytical results obtained are promising enough to ensure the use of immobilized aptamer paper-spray as both the extraction and ionization techniques in IMS for direct analysis of biomedicine.","aptamer, ion mobility spectrometry, paper spray ionization",Journal Of Pharmaceutical And Biomedical Analysis,select microextract base aptam immobil cellulos paper use paper spray ioniz sourc ion mobil spectrometri first time method paper use ioniz sourc also util select extract analyt base immobil aptam combin integr sampl prepar analyt ioniz whatman paper end appropri sampl introduct system novel design construct paper spray ioniz sourc use system continu solvent flow work elut spray solvent simultan method analyt adsorb triangular paper immobil aptam desorb ioniz elut solvent appli high voltag paper respect effect differ experiment paramet appli voltag angl paper tip distanc paper tip counter electrod elut solvent type solvent flow rate optim propos method exhaust valid term sensit reproduc analyz standard solut codein acetamiprid analyt result obtain promis enough ensur use immobil aptam extract ioniz techniqu im direct analysi biomedicin immobil aptam paper spray ioniz sourc ion mobil spectrometri
496,Medicating the environment: assessing risks of pharmaceuticals to wildlife and ecosystems.,"Global pharmaceutical consumption is rising with the growing and ageing human population and more intensive food production. Recent studies have revealed pharmaceutical residues in a wide range of ecosystems and organisms. Environmental concentrations are often low, but pharmaceuticals typically are designed to have biological effects at low doses, acting on physiological systems that can be evolutionarily conserved across taxa. This Theme Issue introduces the latest research investigating the risks of environmentally relevant concentrations of pharmaceuticals to vertebrate wildlife. We take a holistic, global view of environmental exposure to pharmaceuticals encompassing terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems in high- and low-income countries. Based on both field and laboratory data, the evidence for and relevance of changes to physiology and behaviour, in addition to mortality and reproductive effects, are examined in terms of the population- and community-level consequences of pharmaceutical exposure on wildlife. Studies on uptake, trophic transfer and indirect effects of pharmaceuticals acting via food webs are presented. Given the logistical and ethical complexities of research in this area, several papers focus on techniques for prioritizing which compounds are most likely to harm wildlife and how modelling approaches can make predictions about the bioavailability, metabolism and toxicity of pharmaceuticals in non-target species. This Theme Issue aims to help clarify the uncertainties, highlight opportunities and inform ongoing scientific and policy debates on the impacts of pharmaceuticals in the environment.","contaminants, ecotoxicology, environmental risk assessment, pharmaceuticals, population ecology, sewage","Philosophical Transactions Of The Royal Society Of London.

497,Moringa oleifera seeds-removed ripened pods as alternative for papersheet production: antimicrobial activity and their phytoconstituents profile using HPLC.,"In the present study, and for the waste valorization, Moringa oleifera seeds-removed ripened pods (SRRP) were used for papersheet production and for the extraction of bioactive compounds. Fibers were characterized by SEM-EDX patterns, while the phytoconstituents in ethanol extract was analyzed by HPLC. The inhibition percentage of fungal mycelial growth (IFMG) of the treated Melia azedarach wood with M. oleifera SRRP extract at the concentrations of 10,000, 20,000, and 30,000 µg/mL against the growth of Rhizoctonia solani and Fusarium culmorum was calculated and compared with fluconazole (25 µg). The produced papersheet was treated with the ethanol extract (4000, 2000, and 1000 µg/mL) and assayed for its antibacterial activity against Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Erwinia amylovora, and Pectobacterium atrosepticum by measuring the inhibition zones and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). According to chemical analysis of M. oleifera SRRP, benzene:alcohol extractives, holocellulose, lignin, and ash contents were 7.56, 64.94, 25.66 and 1.53%, respectively, while for the produced unbleached pulp, the screen pulp yield and the Kappa number were 39% and 25, respectively. The produced papersheet showed tensile index, tear index, burst index, and double fold number values of 58.8 N m/g, 3.38 mN m<sup>2</sup>/g, 3.86 kPa m<sup>2</sup>/g, and 10.66, respectively. SEM examination showed that the average fiber diameter was 16.39 µm, and the mass average of for elemental composition of C and O by EDX were, 44.21%, and 55.79%, respectively. The main phytoconstituents in the extract (mg/100 g extract) by HPLC were vanillic acid (5053.49), benzoic acid (262.98), naringenin (133.02), chlorogenic acid (66.16), and myricetin (56.27). After 14 days of incubation, M. oleifera SRRP extract-wood treated showed good IFMG against R. solani (36.88%) and F. culmorum (51.66%) compared to fluconazole, where it observed 42.96% and 53.70%, respectively. Moderate to significant antibacterial activity was found, where the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were 500, 650, and 250 µg/mL against the growth of A. tumefaciens, E. amylovora, and P. atrosepticum respectively, which were lower than the positive control used (Tobramycin 10 µg/disc). In conclusion, M. oleifera SRRP showed promising properties as a raw material for pulp and paper production as well as for the extraction of bioactive compounds.",no keywords,Scientific Reports,present studi wast valor moringa oleifera ripen pod srrp use papersheet product extract bioactiv compound fiber character pattern phytoconstitu ethanol extract analyz hplc inhibit percentag fungal myceli growth ifmg treat melia azedarach wood oleifera srrp extract concentr growth rhizoctonia solani fusarium culmorum calcul compar fluconazol µg produc papersheet treat ethanol extract assay antibacteri activ agrobacterium tumefacien erwinia amylovora pectobacterium atrosepticum measur inhibit zone minimum inhibitori concentr mic accord chemic analysi oleifera srrp benzen alcohol extract holocellulos lignin ash content respect produc unbleach pulp screen pulp yield kappa number respect produc papersheet show tensil index tear index burst index doubl fold number valu n mn sup kpa sup respect sem examin show averag fiber diamet µm mass averag element composit c edx respect main phytoconstitu extract g extract hplc vanil acid benzoic acid naringenin chlorogen acid myricetin day incub oleifera srrp treat show good ifmg solani culmorum compar fluconazol observ respect moder signific antibacteri activ found minimum inhibitori concentr mic valu growth tumefacien amylovora atrosepticum respect lower posit control use tobramycin conclus oleifera srrp show promis properti raw materi pulp paper product well extract bioactiv compound moringa oleifera ripen pod altern papersheet product antimicrobi activ phytoconstitu profil use hplc
498,Absorption enhancers: applications and advances.,"Absorption enhancers are functional excipients included in formulations to improve the absorption of a pharmacologically active drug. The term absorption enhancer usually refers to an agent whose function is to increase absorption by enhancing membrane permeation, rather than increasing solubility, so such agents are sometimes more specifically termed permeation enhancers. Absorption enhancers have been investigated for at least two decades, particularly in efforts to develop non-injection formulations for peptides, proteins, and other pharmacologically active compounds that have poor membrane permeability. While at least one product utilizing an absorption enhancer for transdermal use has reached the market, quite a few more appear to be at the threshold of becoming products, and these include oral and transmucosal applications. This paper will review some of the most advanced absorption enhancers currently in development and the formulation technologies employed that have led to their success. In addition, a more basic review of the barriers to absorption and the mechanisms by which those barriers can be surmounted is presented. Factors influencing the success of absorption-enhancing formulations are discussed. If ultimately successful, the products now in development should offer non-injection alternatives for several peptide or protein drugs currently only administered by injection. The introduction of new absorption enhancers as accepted pharmaceutical excipients, and the development of formulation technologies that afford the greatest benefit/risk ratio for their use, may create opportunities to apply these enabling technologies more broadly to existing drugs with non-optimal delivery properties.",no keywords,The Aaps Journal,absorpt enhanc function excipi includ formul improv absorpt pharmacolog activ drug term absorpt enhanc usual refer agent whose function increas absorpt enhanc membran permeat rather increas solubl agent sometim specif term permeat enhanc absorpt enhanc investig least two decad particularli effort develop formul peptid protein pharmacolog activ compound poor membran permeabl least one product util absorpt enhanc transderm use reach market quit appear threshold becom product includ oral transmucos applic paper review advanc absorpt enhanc current develop formul technolog employ led success addit basic review barrier absorpt mechan barrier surmount present factor influenc success formul discus ultim success product develop offer altern sever peptid protein drug current administ inject introduct new absorpt enhanc accept pharmaceut excipi develop formul technolog afford greatest ratio use may creat opportun appli enabl technolog broadli exist drug deliveri properti absorpt enhanc applic advanc
499,Control and analysis of alkyl and benzyl halides and other related reactive organohalides as potential genotoxic impurities in active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).,"This paper continues the review of the relevant scientific literature associated with the control and analysis of potential genotoxic impurities (PGIs) in active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). The initial review [D.P. Elder, A. Teasdale, A.M. Lipczynski, J. Pharm. Biomed. Anal. 46 (2008) 1-8.] focused on the specific class of sulfonate esters but in this instance reference is made to the analysis of alkyl and benzyl halides and other related reactive organohalide alkylating agents. Such reactive materials are commonly employed in pharmaceutical research and development as raw materials, reagents and intermediates in the chemical synthesis of new drug substances. Consequently a great deal of attention and effort is extended by the innovative and ethical pharmaceutical industry to ensure that appropriate and practicable control strategies are established during drug development to ensure residues of such agents, as potential impurities in new drug substances, are either eliminated or minimized to such an extent so as to not present a significant safety risk to volunteers and patients in clinical trials and beyond. The reliable trace analysis of such reactive organohalides is central to such control strategies and invariably involves a state-of-the-art combination of high-resolution separation science techniques coupled to sensitive and selective modes of detection. This article reports on the most recent developments in the regulatory environment, overall strategies for the control of alkylating agents and the latest developments in analysis culminating in a literature review of analytical approaches. The literature is sub-categorized by separation technique (gas chromatography (GC), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), thin layer chromatography (TLC) and capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE)) and further tabulated by API type and impurity with brief method details and references. As part of this exercise, a selection of relevant pharmacopoeial monographs was also reviewed.

500,Biomolecular Network Controllability With Drug Binding Information.,"Complex networks are ubiquitous in nature. In biological systems, biomolecules interact with each other to form so-called biomolecular networks, which determine the cellular behaviors of living organisms. Controlling the cellular behaviors by regulating certain biomolecules in the network is one of the most concerned problems in systems biology. Recently, the connections between biological networks and structural control theory have been explored, uncovering some interesting biological phenomena. Some researchers have paid attentions to the structural controllability of networks in notion of the minimum steering sets (MSSs). However, because the MSSs for complex networks are not unique and the importance of different MSSs is diverse in real applications, MSSs with certain meanings should be studied. In this paper, we investigated the MSSs of biomolecular networks by considering the drug binding information. The biomolecules in the MSSs with binding preference are enriched with known drug targets and are likely to have more chemical-binding opportunities with existing drugs compared with randomly chosen MSSs, suggesting novel applications for drug target identification and drug repositioning.",no keywords,Ieee Transactions On Nanobioscience,complex network ubiquit natur biolog system biomolecul interact form biomolecular network determin cellular behavior live organ control cellular behavior regul certain biomolecul network one concern problem system biolog recent connect biolog network structur control theori explor uncov interest biolog phenomenon research paid attent structur control network notion minimum steer set msss howev msss complex network uniqu import differ msss diver real applic msss certain mean studi paper investig msss biomolecular network consid drug bind inform biomolecul msss bind prefer enrich known drug target like opportun exist drug compar randomli chosen msss suggest novel applic drug target identif drug reposit biomolecular network control drug bind inform
501,Optimization of cationic (Q)-paper for detection of arboviruses in infected mosquitoes.,"Previously (Glushakova et al. 2017), a cellulose-based cationic (Q) paper derivatized with quaternary ammonium groups was shown to be a convenient platform to collect, preserve, and store nucleic acids (NAs) derived from mosquito vectors infected with pathogens for surveillance. NAs bind electrostatically to Q-paper, but the quantity of NA bound depends on the paper's binding capacity. To optimize the original technology for mosquito surveillance, factors that affected NA absorbance on Q-paper were evaluated. Sixteen variations of Q-paper were prepared with modifications of the derivatizing reagents and derivatization temperature. The binding capacities of these variations were determined first with 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic (BTCA), then viral RNA (purified or in infected mosquito samples) was used for validation. For this, samples with Zika (ZIKV) and chikungunya (CHIKV) RNA or virus-infected Aedes aegypti mosquito bodies were applied to sixteen Q-paper variants. Washing the paper samples with water versus elution with aqueous salt (1 M) gave samples that were analyzed for viral RNA by a PCR-based direct Luminex hybridization assay. The comparison ranked the Q-paper binding capacities from the lowest to the highest. The Q-paper with the highest RNA binding capability was further validated with ZIKV- and CHIKV-infected mosquito saliva.","arboviruses, cationic (q) paper, mosquito",Journal Of Virological Methods,previous glushakova et al cation q paper derivat quaternari ammonium group shown conveni platform collect preserv store nucleic acid na deriv mosquito vector infect pathogen surveil na bind electrostat quantiti na bound depend paper bind capac optim origin technolog mosquito surveil factor affect na absorb evalu sixteen variat prepar modif derivat reagent derivat temperatur bind capac variat determin first btca viral rna purifi infect mosquito sampl use valid sampl zika zikv chikungunya chikv rna aed aegypti mosquito bodi appli sixteen variant wash paper sampl water versu elut aqueou salt gave sampl analyz viral rna direct luminex hybrid assay comparison rank bind capac lowest highest highest rna bind capabl valid mosquito saliva optim cation q detect arbovirus infect mosquito
502,Emulsion-Based Multicompartment Vaginal Drug Carriers: From Nanoemulsions to Nanoemulgels.,"In order to overcome the limitations associated with vaginal administration of drugs, e.g., the short contact time of the drug form with the mucosa or continuous carrier wash-out, the development of new carriers for gynecological use is necessary. Furthermore, high individual anatomical and physiological variability resulting in unsatisfactory therapeutic efficacy of lipophilic active substances requires application of multicompartment drug delivery systems. This manuscript provides an up-to-date comprehensive review of the literature on emulsion-based vaginal dosage forms (EVDF) including macroemulsions, microemulsions, nanoemulsions, multiple emulsions and self-emulsifying drug delivery systems. The first part of the paper discusses (i) the influence of anatomical-physiological conditions on therapeutic efficacy of drug forms after local and systemic administration, (ii) characterization of EVDF components and the manufacturing techniques of these dosage forms and (iii) methods used to evaluate the physicochemical and pharmaceutical properties of emulsion-based vaginal dosage forms.

504,Screening of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors from natural products via origami microﬂuidic paper-based analytical devices with colorimetric detection.,"We report the screening of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on an origami microﬂuidic paper-based analytical device (μPAD) using colorimetric detection. The hydrolysis product reacts with ninhydrin, resulting in a purple color at the detection zones. Images of the μPADs are captured using a common cell phone and analyzed with Photoshop software. This platform allows six independent colorimetric reactions to take place simultaneously, and the IC<sub>50</sub> values can be obtained in a single run within 22 min. The relative standard deviations of inhibition efficiencies are generally lower than 4.0 % (n = 5). The IC<sub>50</sub> values of captopril and five products from natural plants were obtained and corresponded well with UV methods. The relative deviations between the two methods are within the range of -5 % to +5 %. This work is a proof-of-concept successfully demonstrating the use of μPADs technology to screen enzyme inhibitors from natural products.","angiotensin converting enzyme, colorimetric detection, hypertension, microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (μpads), natural products",Journal Of Pharmaceutical And Biomedical Analysis,report screen angiotensin convert enzym ace inhibitor origami microﬂuid analyt devic μpad use colorimetr detect hydrolysi product react ninhydrin result purpl color detect zone imag μpad captur use common cell phone analyz photoshop softwar platform allow six independ colorimetr reaction take place simultan ic sub valu obtain singl run within min rel standard deviat inhibit effici gener lower n ic sub valu captopril five product natur plant obtain correspond well uv method rel deviat two method within rang work success demonstr use μpad technolog screen enzym inhibitor natur product screen angiotensin convert enzym inhibitor natur product via origami microﬂuid analyt devic colorimetr detect

507,[Alternatives for adopting policies centered on access to medicines].,"Latin America is adopting regulations that bear on medicinal costs and spending. The regulations have four main goals: i) to guarantee a competitive market, ii) to ensure affordability for individual consumers (commercial channel), iii) to contain public spending on medicines (institutional channel), and iv) to guarantee efficient spending on medicines. The experience of Latin America differs from that of countries in developed regions. In the latter, the countries tend to have similar policies, both in promoting generic medicines and in price control strategies, and in optimizing and containing pharmaceutical expense. In contrast, in Latin America, certain institutional weaknesses impede the consolidation and application of an effective regulatory policy. This paper reviews the experience gained through the adoption of economic regulations aimed at reducing spending and improving access to medicines, suggests lessons learned at the international level, and offers recommendations for the countries of Latin America.

509,Evaluation of flash supercritical fluid chromatography and alternate sample loading techniques for pharmaceutical medicinal chemistry purifications.,"Flash chromatography is the preferred approach for small molecule purification in pharmaceutical discovery. This paper will discuss the potential for flash supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) as an alternative technology for these purifications. It was shown that the high sample loadings seen with flash LC could also be achieved using flash SFC. The dry load injection technique greatly increases the amount of sample that can be applied to a flash SFC column while still achieving separation. Flash SFC has much lower solvent usage and higher purification productivities relative to flash LC. Product concentrations post purification were higher for flash SFC vs. flash LC, reducing the time required to isolate dry product. There still exist a number of technical details to be worked out with flash SFC, mainly around the equipment and column/cartridge technology.",no keywords,Journal Of Chromatography.

510,Evaluation of a polysaccharide-based chiral reversed-phase liquid chromatography screen strategy in pharmaceutical analysis.,"Chirality control plays a critical role in developing stereoisomeric drugs. Due to the complexity and lack of predictability in chiral separations, column screening remains the gold standard to initiate chiral method development for active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and synthetic intermediates. Chiral reversed-phase (RP) liquid chromatography (LC) has gained favor over other modes due to its versatility and compatibility in analyzing a wide range of chiral compounds in various matrices. Herein, we established a tier-based chiral RPLC screen strategy by constructing and analyzing a database of 101 chiral screens with a total of 3,401 entries (unique LC runs) for proprietary APIs or intermediates at Bristol Myers Squibb. Up to 17 polysaccharide-based chiral stationary phases (CSPs) and four mobile phases (MPs) have been screened with gradient elution. A selection of ten CSPs with two MPs was found sufficient to achieve successful separation for 82% of the total screens. Two RPLC screen tiers (Tier 1: AZ, OD, ID, and IG) and (Tier 2: AY, OJ, OZ, IA, IC, and IH) were proposed along with two MPs (acidic and neutral) to target ~70% hit rate for Tier 1, and ~80% for the combined set. We also implemented a user-friendly workflow to enable walk-up chiral RPLC screening with automated reports and system suitability tests.","automated screen workflow, chiral reversed-phase screen, pharmaceutical chiral separation, polysaccharide-based chiral stationary phases",Journal Of Chromatography.

511,Long-acting transdermal drug delivery formulations: Current developments and innovative pharmaceutical approaches.,"Transdermal administration remains an active research and development area as an alternative route for long-acting drug delivery. It avoids major drawbacks of conventional oral (gastrointestinal side effects, low drug bioavailability, and need for multiple dosing) or parenteral routes (invasiveness, pain, and psychological stress and bio-hazardous waste generated from needles), thereby increasing patient appeal and compliance. This review focuses on the current state of long-acting transdermal drug delivery, including adhesive patches, microneedles, and molecularly imprinted polymeric systems. Each subsection describes an approach including key considerations in formulation development, design, and process parameters with schematics. An overview of commercially available conventional (adhesive) patches for long-acting drug delivery (longer than 24 h), the reservoir- and matrix-type systems under preclinical evaluation, as well as the advanced transdermal formulations, such as the core-shell, nanoformulations-incorporated and stimuli-responsive microneedles, and 3D-printed and molecularly imprinted polymers that are in development, is also provided.

512,A novel robust hydrogel-assisted paper-based sensor based on fluorescence UiO-66-NH<sub>2</sub>@ZIF-8 for the dual-channel detection of captopril.,"Captopril (CP) is commonly used as an active enzyme inhibitor for the treatment of coronary heart disease, hypertension and angina pectoris. The development of sensitive and efficient method for CP analysis is of great importance in biomedical research. Herein, we fabricated a sensitive and robust hydrogel-assisted paper-based sensor based on fluorescence UiO-66-NH<sub>2</sub>@ZIF-8 and Co, N-doped carbon nanozymes with oxidase-mimicking activity for accurate monitoring of captopril. The hydrogel-assisted paper-based sensor appeared a visible pink signal due to the catalytic oxidation of colorless N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine (DPD) to oxDPD by Co, N-doped carbon-based nanozymes, and resulted in the fluorescence quenching of UiO-66-NH<sub>2</sub>@ZIF-8. In the presence of captopril, the oxidation of chromogenic substrate DPD by Co, N-doped nanozymes in the hydrogel-assisted paper-based sensor was hindered and accompanied by a change in the visible color, leading to recovery of the fluorescence of UiO-66-NH<sub>2</sub>@ZIF-8, and the change in the fluorescence color could also be observed. Therefore, the quantitative detection of captopril is achieved by taking a smartphone photograph and converting the image parameters into data information using ImageJ software. The portable hydrogel-assisted paper sensor provided sensitive detection of captopril in two modes based on visible color change as well as fluorescence color change with limits of detection of 0.45 μM and 0.47 μM, respectively. This hydrogel-assisted paper-based sensor has been successfully applied to the accurate monitoring of captopril in human serum, providing a potential avenue for in situ detection of captopril.","captopril, co, hydrogel-assisted paper-based sensor, n-doped nanozymes, uio-66-nh(2)@zif-8",Talanta,captopril cp commonli use activ enzym inhibitor treatment coronari heart diseas hypertens angina pectori develop sensit effici method cp analysi great import biomed research herein fabric sensit robust sensor base fluoresc sub co carbon nanozym activ accur monitor captopril sensor appear visibl pink signal due catalyt oxid colorless n dpd oxdpd co nanozym result fluoresc quench sub presenc captopril oxid chromogen substrat dpd co nanozym sensor hinder accompani chang visibl color lead recoveri fluoresc sub chang fluoresc color could also observ therefor quantit detect captopril achiev take smartphon photograph convert imag paramet data inform use imagej softwar portabl paper sensor provid sensit detect captopril two mode base visibl color chang well fluoresc color chang limit detect μm μm respect sensor success appli accur monitor captopril human serum provid potenti avenu situ detect captopril novel robust sensor base fluoresc sub detect captopril

515,What Can Electrochemical Methods Offer in Determining DNA-Drug Interactions?,"The interactions of compounds with DNA have been studied since the recognition of the role of nucleic acid in organisms. The design of molecules which specifically interact with DNA sequences allows for the control of the gene expression. Determining the type and strength of such interaction is an indispensable element of pharmaceutical studies. Cognition of the therapeutic action mechanisms is particularly important for designing new drugs. Owing to their sensitivity, simplicity, and low costs, electrochemical methods are increasingly used for this type of research. Compared to other techniques, they require a small number of samples and are characterized by a high reliability. These methods can provide information about the type of interaction and the binding strength, as well as the damage caused by biologically active molecules targeting the cellular DNA. This review paper summarizes the various electrochemical approaches used for the study of the interactions between pharmaceuticals and DNA. The main focus is on the papers from the last decade, with particular attention on the voltammetric techniques. The most preferred experimental approaches, the electrode materials and the new methods of modification are presented. The data on the detection ranges, the binding modes and the binding constant values of pharmaceuticals are summarized.

This method, which makes use of the Lipinski RDKit module, an open-source cheminformatics software, enables the incorporation of any global molecular (such as molecular charge and molecular weight) and local (such as atom hybridization and bond orders) information. In this paper, we show that this method significantly outperforms another recently proposed method based on deep convolutional neural networks on several datasets that are studied. Several best practices for training deep convolutional neural networks on chemical datasets are also highlighted within the article, such as how to select the information to be included in the model, how to prevent overfitting and how unbalanced classes in the data can be handled.","deep learning, molecular property prediction, side effects prediction, unbalanced data",Journal Of Integrative Bioinformatics,present flexibl deep convolut neural network method analysi arbitrari size graph structur repres molecul method make use lipinski rdkit modul cheminformat softwar enabl incorpor global molecular molecular charg molecular weight local atom hybrid bond order inform paper show method significantli outperform anoth recent propos method base deep convolut neural network sever dataset studi sever best practic train deep convolut neural network chemic dataset also highlight within articl select inform includ model prevent overfit unbalanc class data handl deep convolut neural network predict molecular properti challeng opportun connect data

518,Methodology to estimate the break force of pharmaceutical tablets with curved faces under diametrical compression.,"This paper develops a methodology to estimate the break force of curved faced tablets under diametrical compression. Common excipients used in pharmaceutical tablet formulations, including microcrystalline cellulose, calcium phosphate and mannitol as well as their mixtures were characterised. Compacts of different densities were manufactured and their compressive and tensile strength was measured. The break force of curved face tablets having a comprehensive range of face curvatures and thickness was measured using the diametrical compression method (""hardness"" test). Equation σ<sub>d</sub>=FπD<sup>2</sup>atD+bWD<sup>-1</sup> introduced by Shang et al. (2013) was used to relate the break force (F) to tablet geometry (D, t, W) and material tensile strength (σ<sub>d</sub>). Here, we propose a method to estimate the parameters a and b using data for flat faced tablets. The method was validated for four mixtures. The errors were analysed and compared with the USP29 method σ<sub>d</sub>=10FπD<sup>2</sup>(2.84(t/D)-0.126t/W+3.15(W/D)+0.01)<sup>-1</sup>.

519,Innovative pMDI formulations of spray-dried nanoparticles for efficient pulmonary drug delivery.,"For drug delivery to the lungs, the aerodynamic size of drug particles plays a predominant role in determining the sites of deposition in the airway, and the particles with the size less than 2μm are highly expected as they will be preferably delivered to the ideal site of alveolar regions. In this paper, a novel platform technology has been developed, where the water (containing pharmaceutically active agents)-in-oil (w/o) microemulsions were spray-dried to generate nanosized drug particles that were able to be homogeneously dispersed in the propellant to form an exceptionally stable suspensions with no precipitates or flocculates during a long time storage. High fine particle (<5.8μm) fraction (∼70% w/w) was achieved, irrespectively of drug molecular size and storage time. This platform technology works pretty well on chemical drugs (i.e. salbutamol sulphate) and biotherapeutics (i.e. insulin) for the generation of nanoparticles, and the nanoparticle pMDI formulations were homogeneous, stable and of high delivery efficiency to the lungs, representing an ideal way for pulmonary delivery.","inhalation, microemulsions, nanoparticles, spray-drying, pmdi",International Journal Of Pharmaceutics,drug deliveri lung aerodynam size drug particl play predomin role determin site deposit airway particl size less highli expect prefer deliv ideal site alveolar region paper novel platform technolog develop water contain pharmaceut activ agent microemuls gener nanos drug particl abl homogen dispers propel form except stabl suspens precipit floccul long time storag high fine particl fraction achiev irrespect drug molecular size storag time platform technolog work pretti well chemic drug salbutamol sulphat biotherapeut insulin gener nanoparticl nanoparticl pmdi formul homogen stabl high deliveri effici lung repres ideal way pulmonari deliveri innov pmdi formul nanoparticl effici pulmonari drug deliveri

521,Electrochemical microfluidic paper-based analytical devices for cancer biomarker detection: From 2D to 3D sensing systems.,"Microﬂuidic paper-based analytical devices (μPADs) offer a unique possibility for a cost-effective portable and rapid detection of a wide range of small molecules and macromolecules and even microorganisms. In this line, electrochemical detection methods are key techniques for the qualitative analysis of different types of ligands. The electrochemical sensing μPADs have been devised for the rapid, accurate, and quantitative detection of oncomarkers through two-/three-dimensional (2D/3D) approaches. The 2D μPADs were first developed and then transformed into 3D systems via folding and/or twisting of paper. The microfluidic channels and connections were created within the layers of paper. Based on the fabrication methods, 3D μPADs can be classified into origami and stacking devices. Various fabrication methods and materials have been used to create hydrophilic channels in μPADs, among which the wax printing technique is the most common method in fabricating μPADs. In this review, we discuss the fabrication and design strategies of μPADs, elaborate on their detection modes, and highlight their applications in affinity-based electrochemical μPADs methods for the detection of oncomarkers.","cancer biomarkers, electrochemical biosensor, microﬂuidics, onocomarkers, paper-based analytical devices (μpads)",Talanta,microﬂuid analyt devic μpad offer uniqu possibl portabl rapid detect wide rang small molecul macromolecul even microorgan line electrochem detect method key techniqu qualit analysi differ type ligand electrochem sen μpad devi rapid accur quantit detect oncomark approach μpad first develop transform system via fold twist paper microfluid channel connect creat within layer paper base fabric method μpad classifi origami stack devic variou fabric method materi use creat hydrophil channel μpad among wax print techniqu common method fabric μpad review discus fabric design strategi μpad elabor detect mode highlight applic electrochem μpad method detect oncomark electrochem microfluid analyt devic cancer biomark detect sen system

523,Prediction of passive blood-brain partitioning: straightforward and effective classification models based on in silico derived physicochemical descriptors.,"The distribution of compounds between blood and brain is a very important consideration for new candidate drug molecules. In this paper, we describe the derivation of two linear discriminant analysis (LDA) models for the prediction of passive blood-brain partitioning, expressed in terms of logBB values. The models are based on computationally derived physicochemical descriptors, namely the octanol/water partition coefficient (logP), the topological polar surface area (TPSA) and the total number of acidic and basic atoms, and were obtained using a homogeneous training set of 307 compounds, for all of which the published experimental logBB data had been determined in vivo. In particular, since molecules with logBB>0.3 cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) readily while molecules with logBB<-1 are poorly distributed to the brain, on the basis of these thresholds we derived two distinct models, both of which show a percentage of good classification of about 80%. Notably, the predictive power of our models was confirmed by the analysis of a large external dataset of compounds with reported activity on the central nervous system (CNS) or lack thereof. The calculation of straightforward physicochemical descriptors is the only requirement for the prediction of the logBB of novel compounds through our models, which can be conveniently applied in conjunction with drug design and virtual screenings.",no keywords,Journal Of Molecular Graphics & Modelling,distribut compound blood brain import consider new candid drug molecul paper describ deriv two linear discrimin analysi lda model predict passiv partit express term logbb valu model base comput deriv physicochem descriptor name partit coeffici logp topolog polar surfac area tpsa total number acid basic atom obtain use homogen train set compound publish experiment logbb data determin vivo particular sinc molecul logbb cross barrier bbb readili molecul logbb poorli distribut brain basi threshold deriv two distinct model show percentag good classif notabl predict power model confirm analysi larg extern dataset compound report activ central nervou system cn lack thereof calcul straightforward physicochem descriptor requir predict logbb novel compound model conveni appli conjunct drug design virtual screen predict passiv partit straightforward effect classif model base silico deriv physicochem descriptor
524,"Deuterated active pharmaceutical ingredients: A science-based proposal for synthesis, analysis, and control. Part 1: Framing the problem.","The International Consortium for Innovation & Quality (IQ) in Pharmaceutical Development recently established a working group focused on the development of a guidance to address Deuterated Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients. Deuteration of an Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) in some cases can retard and/or alter API metabolism by exploiting the primary kinetic isotope effect. Several deuterated APIs have entered into the clinic, and one has recently been approved. In most cases, it is very difficult to nearly impossible to synthesize a 100% isotopically pure compound. This raises synthetic, analytical, and regulatory questions that warrant a science-based assessment and recommendations for synthetic methods, analytical methods, and specifications. A cross functional team of scientists with expertise in isotope chemistry, process chemistry, analytical chemistry, and drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics have been meeting under the auspices of IQ to define and address these questions.

525,Best practices in a tiered approach to metabolite quantification: views and recommendations of the European Bioanalysis Forum.,"The relationship between the exposure to drug metabolites and overall drug safety has become an integral part of the drug-development process. In-depth discussions in the scientific community, as well as recent guidelines on Drug Safety Testing of Metabolites from the US FDA (often referred to as the MIST guidance and ICH M3(R2) from the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH), has brought clarity to the regulatory requirements of the sponsor company in providing documentation on circulating levels of qualifying metabolites. However, less attention has been given to the challenges now faced by the bioanalytical community in supporting these new guidance policies. In this paper, the European Bioanalysis Forum (EBF) is providing a recommendation on which quality standards to apply when assessing the (relative) abundance or absolute concentrations of metabolites.

526,Innovative medicinal chemistry strategies for enhancing drug solubility.,"Drug candidates with poor solubility have been recognized as the cause of many drug development failures, owing to the fact that low solubility is unfavorable for physicochemical, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) properties. Given the imperative role of solubility during drug development, we herein summarize various strategies for solubility optimizations from a medicinal chemistry perspective, including introduction of polar group, salt formation, structural simplification, disruption of molecular planarity and symmetry, optimizations on the solvent exposed region as well as prodrug design. In addition, methods for solubility assessment and prediction are reviewed. Besides, we have deeply discussed the strategies for solubility improvement. This paper is expected to be beneficial for the development of drug-like molecules with good solubility.","medicinal chemistry, optimizations, solubility",European Journal Of Medicinal Chemistry,drug candid poor solubl recogn caus mani drug develop failur owe fact low solubl unfavor physicochem pharmacokinet pk pharmacodynam pd properti given imper role solubl drug develop herein summar variou strategi solubl optim medicin chemistri perspect includ introduct polar group salt format structur simplif disrupt molecular planar symmetri optim solvent expo region well prodrug design addit method solubl assess predict review besid deepli discus strategi solubl improv paper expect benefici develop molecul good solubl innov medicin chemistri strategi enhanc drug solubl
527,"Nail disorders in older people, and aspects of their pharmaceutical treatment.","The aim of this paper was to explore how aging influences the nail unit, its disorders and its response to treatment, and to identify some of the age-related gaps in the ungual drug delivery literature. Aging causes obvious changes to the nail, some of which are inherently due to old age, while others are due to diseases/conditions which become more prevalent as we age. Alterations in the nail plate's colour, contour, thickness, fragility, surface features, cell size, chemical composition and growth rate are some of the changes, with toenails and fingernails showing different effects. With respect to disease, the incidence of onychomycosis - the most common nail disorder - is considerably higher in older people. Similarly, brittle nails become more common as we age. In contrast, the literature about aging and the incidence of nail psoriasis is inconclusive, although, it is clear that as one gets older, the negative impact of nail psoriasis on one's quality of life decreases. Pharmaceutical treatment of the diseases comprises local and systemic therapies, sometimes in combination. Systemic therapies have the inherent disadvantages of adverse systemic effects, drug interactions and the need for monitoring, disadvantages which are especially problematic for older people who are more likely to suffer from co-morbidities and be on other medications. Topical therapy avoids such disadvantages. However, the success rates of commercially available preparations are low, and older people may need help with their application. It is also proposed that regular inspection and grooming of nails should become part of routine care of older people, as these would provide opportunities to identify and treat any problems at an earlier stage.","elderly, geriatric, nail, older, onychomycosis, psoriasis, ungual, disease",International Journal Of Pharmaceutics,aim paper explor age influenc nail unit disord respons treatment identifi gap ungual drug deliveri literatur age caus obviou chang nail inher due old age other due becom preval age alter nail plate colour contour thick fragil surfac featur cell size chemic composit growth rate chang toenail fingernail show differ effect respect diseas incid onychomycosi common nail disord consider higher older peopl similarli brittl nail becom common age contrast literatur age incid nail psoriasi inconclus although clear one get older neg impact nail psoriasi one qualiti life decreas pharmaceut treatment diseas compris local system therapi sometim combin system therapi inher disadvantag advers system effect drug interact need monitor disadvantag especi problemat older peopl like suffer medic topic therapi avoid disadvantag howev success rate commerci avail prepar low older peopl may need help applic also propos regular inspect groom nail becom part routin care older peopl would provid opportun identifi treat problem earlier stage nail disord older peopl aspect pharmaceut treatment

529,Deep eutectic solvents for pharmaceutical formulation and drug delivery applications.,"Solvents play key roles in designing drug delivery systems (DDSs). They are used as the reaction media in the preparation of DDSs and as vehicles for delivery of problematic drugs. The number of pharmaceutically acceptable solvents is limited and developing new green ones is of a great of interest. A deep eutectic solvent (DES) is a room temperature liquid composed of a mixture of hydrogen bond acceptor and hydrogen bond donor. DESs exhibit interesting physical and chemical characteristics such as low vapor pressure, non-inflammability, chemically tailorable, solvency power for a wide range of solutes, and water non-reactivity. Furthermore, they can be easily prepared from low toxicity, readily available, and inexpensive constituents. Due to these properties, DESs have attracted growing attention as green solvents in different areas of science from chemistry to material engineering and biology. In this review, after a brief introduction about DESs, we provide an overview about current advances made over the last decade in utilizing of DESs for solubilization of water insoluble drugs, transdermal drug delivery, inorganic nanoparticle synthesis, and designing polymeric and self-assembled drug carriers. This paper also discusses main challenges and limitations of DESs that should be considered before using of them.","deep eutectic solvents, active pharmaceutical ingredient, drug delivery, nanomaterials, self-assembly, solubility, toxicity",Pharmaceutical Development And Technology,solvent play key role design drug deliveri system dds use reaction medium prepar dds vehicl deliveri problemat drug number pharmaceut accept solvent limit develop new green one great interest deep eutect solvent de room temperatur liquid compos mixtur hydrogen bond acceptor hydrogen bond donor des exhibit interest physic chemic characterist low vapor pressur chemic tailor solvenc power wide rang solut water furthermor easili prepar low toxic readili avail inexpens constitu due properti des attract grow attent green solvent differ area scienc chemistri materi engin biolog review brief introduct des provid overview current advanc made last decad util des solubil water insolubl drug transderm drug deliveri inorgan nanoparticl synthesi design polymer drug carrier paper also discus main challeng limit des consid use deep eutect solvent pharmaceut formul drug deliveri applic
530,Mesoporous systems for poorly soluble drugs - recent trends.,"When poor aqueous solubility of active pharmaceutical ingredients is encountered during a drug formulation process, the toolbox typically utilized contains pharmaceutical salts, co-crystals, solid dispersions, cyclodextrins, lipids, liposomes and nanocrystals etc. Especially in the pharmaceutical industry, the option which confers the greatest benefit with the lowest risk is usually chosen. Several factors affect the final decision, but new technologies should also be considered especially if they can address several issues at the same time. Mesoporous inorganic systems are emerging technologies which can be utilized for improving the dissolution of poorly soluble drugs. The number of the scientific papers in this field is steadily increasing and the focus of the studies is moving away from in vitro to in vivo experiments with the first human trial already completed. Meanwhile, several start-up companies focusing on mesoporous carriers have been established. Therefore, it is conceivable that the first commercial products will find their way to pharmacies during the next 5-10 years. The present review surveys recent progress in research on mesoporous materials as carriers of poorly soluble drugs. We will concentrate on the research published since our previous review published in 2012 [10.1016/j.ijpharm.2012.09.008] up to the present day.","dissolution, drug delivery, mesoporous, nanoporous, poorly soluble, solubility",International Journal Of Pharmaceutics,poor aqueou solubl activ pharmaceut ingredi encount drug formul process toolbox typic util contain pharmaceut salt solid dispers cyclodextrin lipid liposom nanocryst etc especi pharmaceut industri option confer greatest benefit lowest risk usual chosen sever factor affect final decis new technolog also consid especi address sever issu time mesopor inorgan system emerg technolog util improv dissolut poorli solubl drug number scientif paper field steadili increas focu studi move away vitro vivo experi first human trial alreadi complet meanwhil sever compani focus mesopor carrier establish therefor conceiv first commerci product find way pharmaci next year present review survey recent progress research mesopor materi carrier poorli solubl drug concentr research publish sinc previou review publish present day mesopor system poorli solubl drug recent trend
531,Ф-order kinetics of photoreversible-drug reactions.,"Drug photodegradation data are usually treated by zero-, first- or second-order kinetic equations. Such treatments would lack reliability since the aforementioned equations have been originally developed for pure thermal reactions. In this respect, it has recently been shown that unimolecular photodegradations obey Ф-order kinetics (Maafi and Maafi, 2013). However, no similar information is, thus far, available for other reactions including photoreversible AB(2Ф) systems. This paper aims at filling this gap for AB(2Ф) kinetics.","ab photosystems, actinometry, drugs photodegradation, kinetics modelling",International Journal Of Pharmaceutics,drug photodegrad data usual treat kinet equat treatment would lack reliabl sinc aforement equat origin develop pure thermal reaction respect recent shown unimolecular photodegrad obey kinet maafi maafi howev similar inform thu far avail reaction includ photorevers ab system paper aim fill gap ab kinet kinet reaction

Concerning nanoformulations for drug delivery, they are constituted by nanoparticles with dimensions lower than 1 μm, usually characterized by improved pharmacokinetics, taking advantage of specific targeting, and reduced side effects. The contributors to the present chapter are reviewing a range of papers related to the structural characterization of nanoformulations by X-ray diffraction techniques. The whole of the considered papers underlines the essential role that biophysical techniques have acquired as an essential prerequisite to understanding stability, bioavailability, and lipid, biopolymer, and drug organization in nanoformulations.","lipid nanoparticles, x-ray scattering, cubosomes, drug delivery systems, liquid crystalline phases, nanoformulations, structural characterization, topical administration.",Current Pharmaceutical Design,start second half advent nanotechnolog medicin provok profound revolut area present nanomedicin deliv remark larg set research clinic use tool diagnost devic contrast agent analyt tool physic therapi applic drugdeliveri vehicl concern nanoformul drug deliveri constitut nanoparticl dimens lower μm usual character improv pharmacokinet take advantag specif target reduc side effect contributor present chapter review rang paper relat structur character nanoformul diffract techniqu whole consid paper underlin essenti role biophys techniqu acquir essenti prerequisit understand stabil bioavail lipid biopolym drug organ nanoformul character pharmaceut cosmet lipid nanoparticl cutan applic

534,Combining surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and paper spray mass spectrometry (PS-MS) for illicit drug detection.,"There is an ongoing effort in the US illicit drug market to make new psychoactive compounds more potent and addictive. Due to continuous chemical modifications, many fentanyl analogs are developed and mixed with more traditional illicit drugs, such as cocaine and heroin. Detecting fentanyl and fentanyl analogs in these illicit drug mixtures has become more crucial because of the increased potency and associated health risks. Most confirmatory procedures require time-consuming and expensive, highly sophisticated laboratory equipment and experimental procedures, which can delay critical information that might save a victim or find a suspect. In this study, we propose miniaturizing and accelerating this process by combining surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) analysis and paper spray mass spectrometry (PS-MS). For this aim, dual-purposed paper substrates were developed through soaking in Au/Ag nanostars suspensions. These novel, in-house prepared paper SERS substrates showed stability for up to four weeks with and without the presence of drug compounds. Fentanyl analogs with similar SERS spectra were differentiated by coupling with PS-MS. The limit of detection (LOD) for fentanyl on the paper substrates is 34 μg/mL and 0.32 μg/mL for SERS and PS-MS, respectively. Fentanyl and fentanyl analogs show selective SERS enhancement that helped to detect trace amounts of these opioids in heroin and cocaine street samples. In short, we propose the combination of SERS/PS-MS by using modified paper substrates to develop cost-effective, sensitive, rapid, portable, reliable, and reproducible methods to detect illicit drugs, especially trace amounts of fentanyl and fentanyl analogs in illicit drug mixtures. The combination of these two category A techniques allows for the identification of illicit drugs according to the SWGDRUG guidelines.","fentanyl, fentanyl analogs, forensic science, illicit drug analysis, ps-ms, sers",Talanta,ongo effort u illicit drug market make new psychoact compound potent addict due continu chemic modif mani fentanyl analog develop mix tradit illicit drug cocain heroin detect fentanyl fentanyl analog illicit drug mixtur becom crucial increas potenc associ health risk confirmatori procedur requir expens highli sophist laboratori equip experiment procedur delay critic inform might save victim find suspect studi propos miniatur acceler process combin raman spectroscopi ser analysi paper spray mass spectrometri aim paper substrat develop soak nanostar suspens novel prepar paper ser substrat show stabil four week without presenc drug compound fentanyl analog similar ser spectrum differenti coupl limit detect lod fentanyl paper substrat ser respect fentanyl fentanyl analog show select ser enhanc help detect trace amount opioid heroin cocain street sampl short propos combin use modifi paper substrat develop sensit rapid portabl reliabl reproduc method detect illicit drug especi trace amount fentanyl fentanyl analog illicit drug mixtur combin two categori techniqu allow identif illicit drug accord swgdrug guidelin combin raman spectroscopi ser paper spray mass spectrometri illicit drug detect
535,Evaluation of injection conditions for preparative supercritical fluid chromatography.,"Preparative supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) has become the preferred method for the rapid purification of drug candidates during the pharmaceutical discovery process. This paper will discuss the evaluation of injection techniques for preparative SFC. A thorough evaluation of mixed stream vs. modifier stream™ injection was performed. It was shown that for the majority of the compounds evaluated, modifier stream injection gave better resolution relative to mixed stream injection. The improvement in resolution with modifier stream injection increased as injection volume increased. In addition, a study evaluating the effect of dissolution solvent on chromatographic performance for the preparative resolution of enantiomers using SFC showed that dissolution solvent had minimal impact on preparative resolution for the preparative SFC separation of trans stilbene oxide.",no keywords,Journal Of Chromatography.

536,Greedy and Linear Ensembles of Machine Learning Methods Outperform Single Approaches for QSPR Regression Problems.,"The application of Machine Learning to cheminformatics is a large and active field of research, but there exist few papers which discuss whether ensembles of different Machine Learning methods can improve upon the performance of their component methodologies. Here we investigated a variety of methods, including kernel-based, tree, linear, neural networks, and both greedy and linear ensemble methods. These were all tested against a standardised methodology for regression with data relevant to the pharmaceutical development process. This investigation focused on QSPR problems within drug-like chemical space. We aimed to investigate which methods perform best, and how the 'wisdom of crowds' principle can be applied to ensemble predictors. It was found that no single method performs best for all problems, but that a dynamic, well-structured ensemble predictor would perform very well across the board, usually providing an improvement in performance over the best single method. Its use of weighting factors allows the greedy ensemble to acquire a bigger contribution from the better performing models, and this helps the greedy ensemble generally to outperform the simpler linear ensemble. Choice of data preprocessing methodology was found to be crucial to performance of each method too.","greedy ensembles, linear ensembles, machine learning, quantitative structure-property relationships",Molecular Informatics,applic machin learn cheminformat larg activ field research exist paper discus whether ensembl differ machin learn method improv upon perform compon methodolog investig varieti method includ tree linear neural network greedi linear ensembl method test standardis methodolog regress data relev pharmaceut develop process investig focus qspr problem within chemic space aim investig method perform best crowd principl appli ensembl predictor found singl method perform best problem dynam ensembl predictor would perform well across board usual provid improv perform best singl method use weight factor allow greedi ensembl acquir bigger contribut better perform model help greedi ensembl gener outperform simpler linear ensembl choic data preprocess methodolog found crucial perform method greedi linear ensembl machin learn method outperform singl approach qspr regress problem
537,Flux-Based Formulation Development-A Proof of Concept Study.,"The work aimed to develop the Absorption Driven Drug Formulation (ADDF) concept, which is a new approach in formulation development to ensure that the drug product meets the expected absorption rate. The concept is built on the solubility-permeability interplay and the rate of supersaturation as the driving force of absorption. This paper presents the first case study using the ADDF concept where not only dissolution and solubility but also permeation of the drug is considered in every step of the formulation development. For that reason, parallel artificial membrane permeability assay (PAMPA) was used for excipient selection, small volume dissolution-permeation apparatus was used for testing amorphous solid dispersions (ASDs), and large volume dissolution-permeation tests were carried out to characterize the final dosage forms. The API-excipient interaction studies on PAMPA indicated differences when different fillers or surfactants were studied. These differences were then confirmed with small volume dissolution-permeation assays where the addition of Tween 80 to the ASDs decreased the flux dramatically. Also, the early indication of sorbitol's advantage over mannitol by PAMPA has been confirmed in the investigation of the final dosage forms by large-scale dissolution-permeation tests. This difference between the fillers was observed in vivo as well. The presented case study demonstrated that the ADDF concept opens a new perspective in generic formulation development using fast and cost-effective flux-based screening methods in order to meet the bioequivalence criteria.

540,Dual-acting of Hybrid Compounds - A New Dawn in the Discovery of Multi-target Drugs: Lead Generation Approaches.,"Finding high quality beginning compounds is a critical job at the start of the lead generation stage for multi-target drug discovery (MTDD). Designing hybrid compounds as selective multitarget chemical entity is a challenge, opportunity, and new idea to better act against specific multiple targets. One hybrid molecule is formed by two (or more) pharmacophore group's participation. So, these new compounds often exhibit two or more activities going about as multi-target drugs (mtdrugs) and may have superior safety or efficacy. Application of integrating a range of information and sophisticated new in silico, bioinformatics, structural biology, pharmacogenomics methods may be useful to discover/design, and synthesis of the new hybrid molecules. In this regard, many rational and screening approaches have followed by medicinal chemists for the lead generation in MTDD. Here, we review some popular lead generation approaches that have been used for designing multiple ligands (DMLs). This paper focuses on dual- acting chemical entities that incorporate a part of two drugs or bioactive compounds to compose hybrid molecules. Also, it presents some of key concepts and limitations/strengths of lead generation methods by comparing combination framework method with screening approaches. Besides, a number of examples to represent applications of hybrid molecules in the drug discovery are included.","combination framework, designing multiple ligand, drug discovery, hybrid molecules, medicinal chemistry, multi-target, pharmacophore",Current Topics In Medicinal Chemistry,find high qualiti begin compound critic job start lead gener stage drug discoveri mtdd design hybrid compound select multitarget chemic entiti challeng opportun new idea better act specif multipl target one hybrid molecul form two pharmacophor group particip new compound often exhibit two activ go drug mtdrug may superior safeti efficaci applic integr rang inform sophist new silico bioinformat structur biolog pharmacogenom method may use synthesi new hybrid molecul regard mani ration screen approach follow medicin chemist lead gener mtdd review popular lead gener approach use design multipl ligand dml paper focus act chemic entiti incorpor part two drug bioactiv compound compos hybrid molecul also present key concept lead gener method compar combin framework method screen approach besid number exampl repres applic hybrid molecul drug discoveri includ hybrid compound new dawn discoveri drug lead gener approach
541,Interactions between active pharmaceutical ingredients and excipients affecting bioavailability: impact on bioequivalence.,"The aim of the present paper is to illustrate the impact that excipients may have on the bioavailability of drugs and to review existing US-FDA, WHO and EMA regulatory guidelines on this topic. The first examples illustrate that small amounts of sorbitol (7, 50 or 60mg) affect the bioavailability of risperidone, a class I drug, oral solution, in contrast to what is stated in the US-FDA guidance. Another example suggests, in contrast to what is stated in the US-FDA BCS biowaivers guideline, that a small amount of sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) (3.64mg) affects the bioavailability of risperidone tablets, although the reference product also includes SLS in an amount within the normal range for that type of dosage form. These factors are considered sufficient to ensure that excipients do not affect bioavailability according to the WHO guideline. The alternative criterion, defined in the WHO guideline and used in the FIP BCS biowaivers monographs, that asserts that excipients present in generic products of the ICH countries do not affect bioavailability if used in normal amounts, is shown to be incorrect with an example of alendronate (a class III drug) tablets, where 4mg of SLS increases bioavailability more than 5-fold, although a generic product in the USA contains SLS. Finally, another example illustrates that a 2mg difference in SLS may affect bioavailability of a generic product of a class II drug, even if SLS is contained in the comparator product, and in all cases its amount was within the normal range. Therefore, waivers of in vivo bioequivalence studies (e.g., BCS biowaivers, waivers of certain dosage forms in solution at the time of administration and variations in the excipient composition) should be assessed more cautiously.","bioavailability, biowaivers, drug–excipient interaction, excipient, regulatory requirements",European Journal Of Pharmaceutical Sciences : Official Journal Of The European Federation For Pharmaceutical Sciences,aim present paper illustr impact excipi may bioavail drug review exist ema regulatori guidelin topic first exampl illustr small amount sorbitol affect bioavail risperidon class drug oral solut contrast state guidanc anoth exampl suggest contrast state bc biowaiv guidelin small amount sodium lauryl sulphat sl affect bioavail risperidon tablet although refer product also includ sl amount within normal rang type dosag form factor consid suffici ensur excipi affect bioavail accord guidelin altern criterion defin guidelin use fip bc biowaiv monograph assert excipi present gener product ich countri affect bioavail use normal amount shown incorrect exampl alendron class iii drug tablet sl increas bioavail although gener product usa contain sl final anoth exampl illustr differ sl may affect bioavail gener product class ii drug even sl contain compar product case amount within normal rang therefor waiver vivo bioequival studi bc biowaiv waiver certain dosag form solut time administr variat excipi composit assess cautious interact activ pharmaceut ingredi excipi affect bioavail impact bioequival
542,Investigation of the synergistic effect with amino acid-derived chiral ionic liquids as additives for enantiomeric separation in capillary electrophoresis.,"Recently, chiral ionic liquids (ILs) have drawn more and more attention in chiral separation by capillary electrophoresis (CE). In this paper, two chiral ILs based on amino acid derivatives, L-alanine and L-valine tert butyl ester bis (trifluoromethane) sulfonimide, were applied for the first time in CE to evaluate their potential synergistic effects with classical chiral selectors (β-cyclodextrin derivatives) for enantiomeric separation. As observed, improved separation of tested drug enantiomers was obtained with the presence of chiral ILs compared to the conventional β-cyclodextrin derivatives separation system. Parameters such as type and proportion of organic modifier, type and concentration of chiral ILs, concentration of chiral selector, buffer pH and applied voltage were systematically investigated with Me-β-CD/chiral ILs as model system to optimize the novel synergistic system, and the best results were obtained when 15 mM chiral ILs were introduced into the 30 mM sodium citrate/citric acid (20% organic modifier included) buffer solution containing 20 mM Me-β-CD at pH 5.0 with a 20 kV applied voltage for naproxen, pranoprofen and warfarin.","amino acid-derived ionic liquids, capillary electrophoresis, chiral ionic liquids, chiral separations",Journal Of Chromatography.

544,Understanding performance of 3D-printed sorbent in study of metabolic stability.,"Metabolic stability tests are one of the fundamental steps at the preclinical stages of new drug development. Microsomes, used as a typical enzymatic model of liver biotransformation, can be a challenging matrix for analytical scientists due to a high concentration of cellular proteins and membrane lipids. In the work, we propose a new procedure integrating biotransformation reaction with SPME-like protocol for sample clean-up. It is beneficial to increase the overall quality of results in contrary to the typical protein precipitation approach. A set of ten arylpiperazine analogs, six of which are considered promising drug candidates (and four are accepted drugs) were used as a probe to assess the goodness of the newly proposed approach. In order to promote an efficient extraction protocol, a new, miniaturized shape of a sorbent, suitable to perform the extraction in 100 µL of the sample has been designed. Termination of the biotransformation process by protein denaturation with hot water was additionally evaluated. A quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) study using Orthogonal Partial Least Squares (OPLS) technique to reveal insights to the sorption mechanism was also performed. The obtained results showed the new 3D-printed sorbent can be an attractive basis for the new sample preparation approach for metabolic stability studies and an alternative for commercially available protocols based on solid-phase microextraction (SPME) or solid-phase extraction (SPE) principles.","3d-printed sorbent, advances in pharmaceutical analysis, metabolic stability, microsomes, solid-phase microextraction (spme)",Journal Of Chromatography.

545,Enantiomers separation by capillary electrochromatography using polysaccharide-based stationary phases.,"The separation of chiral compounds is an interesting and important topic of research because these compounds are involved in some biological processes, fundamentally in human health. Among the various application fields where enantiomers are remarkable, drug analysis has to be considered. Most of the drugs contain enantiomers and very often one of the two isomers could be pharmacologically more active or even dangerous. Therefore, the separation of these compounds is very important. Among the different analytical techniques usually employed, capillary electrochromatography has demonstrated great capability in enantiomers resolution. The great potential of this electromigration technique stands mainly in its high efficiency due to the use of an electrosmotic flow (flat flow profile) and on the high selectivity because of the use of a stationary phase. Chiral separation can be obtained utilizing several chiral stationary phases including a polysaccharide derivative. The aim of this review paper is to summarize the main features of capillary electrochromatography and polysaccharide derivatives of chiral stationary phase. It also report examples of practical applications utilizing this approach.","capillary electrochromatography, chiral stationary phases, chirality, enantiomers, polysaccharides",Journal Of Separation Science,separ chiral compound interest import topic research compound involv biolog process fundament human health among variou applic field enantiom remark drug analysi consid drug contain enantiom often one two isom could pharmacolog activ even danger therefor separ compound import among differ analyt techniqu usual employ capillari electrochromatographi demonstr great capabl enantiom resolut great potenti electromigr techniqu stand mainli high effici due use electrosmot flow flat flow profil high select use stationari phase chiral separ obtain util sever chiral stationari phase includ polysaccharid deriv aim review paper summar main featur capillari electrochromatographi polysaccharid deriv chiral stationari phase also report exampl practic applic util approach enantiom separ capillari electrochromatographi use stationari phase
546,What to consider before prescribing inhaled medications: a pragmatic approach for evaluating the current inhaler landscape.,"Inhaled therapies are the cornerstone of treatment in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and there are a multitude of devices available. There is, however, a distinct lack of evidence-based guidance for healthcare providers on how to choose an appropriate inhaler. This review aims to summarise recent updates on topics related to inhaler choice, and to offer practical considerations for healthcare providers regarding currently marketed devices. The importance of choosing the right inhaler for the right patient is discussed, and the relative merits of dry powder inhalers, pressurised metered dose inhalers, breath-actuated pressurised metered dose inhalers, spacers and soft mist inhalers are considered. Compiling the latest studies in the devices therapy area, this review focuses on the most common types of handling errors, as well as the comparative rates of incorrect inhalation technique between devices. The impact of device-specific handling errors on inhaler performance is also discussed, and the characteristics that can impair optimal drug delivery, such as inhalation flow rate, inhalation volume and particle size, are compared between devices. The impact of patient perceptions, behaviours and problems with inhalation technique is analysed, and the need for appropriate patient education is also highlighted. The continued development of technology in inhaler design and the need to standardise study assessment, endpoints and patient populations are identified as future research needs. <i>The reviews of this paper are available via the supplemental material section</i>.","copd, asthma, critical errors, dry powder inhaler, inhalation technique, metered dose inhaler",Therapeutic Advances In Respiratory Disease,inhal therapi cornerston treatment asthma chronic obstruct pulmonari diseas multitud devic avail howev distinct lack guidanc healthcar provid choos appropri inhal review aim summaris recent updat topic relat inhal choic offer practic consider healthcar provid regard current market devic import choos right inhal right patient discus rel merit dri powder inhal pressuris meter dose inhal pressuris meter dose inhal spacer soft mist inhal consid compil latest studi devic therapi area review focus common type handl error well compar rate incorrect inhal techniqu devic impact handl error inhal perform also discus characterist impair optim drug deliveri inhal flow rate inhal volum particl size compar devic impact patient percept behaviour problem inhal techniqu analys need appropri patient educ also highlight continu develop technolog inhal design need standardis studi assess endpoint patient popul identifi futur research need review paper avail via supplement materi section consid prescrib inhal medic pragmat approach evalu current inhal landscap
547,A mechanistic approach to understanding oral drug absorption in pediatrics: an overview of fundamentals.,"The common phrase 'children are not little adults' is very true also in the field of oral drug administration and absorption. However, in practice, due to the little available data and lack of in-depth understanding, physicians may treat kids as if they were 'little adults', even without being aware of the potential differences and risks. With respect to drug discovery, research and development, an in-depth understanding of the various factors governing age-dependent absorption is crucial when trying to develop a pediatric-tailored oral drug product. In this paper we clarify the various mechanisms that may lead to age-dependent oral drug absorption, we provide an overview of the currently available data, and draw conclusions to the coming years.",no keywords,Drug Discovery Today,common phrase littl adult true also field oral drug administr absorpt howev practic due littl avail data lack understand physician may treat kid adult even without awar potenti differ risk respect drug discoveri research develop understand variou factor govern absorpt crucial tri develop oral drug product paper clarifi variou mechan may lead oral drug absorpt provid overview current avail data draw conclus come year mechanist approach understand oral drug absorpt pediatr overview fundament

In recent years, super-resolution microscopy (SRM) has become one of the most popular techniques in the life sciences, especially in the field of living cell imaging. SRM has been used to solve many problems in basic biological research and has great potential in clinical application. In particular, the use of SRM to study drug delivery and kinetics at the subcellular level enables researchers to better study drugs' mechanisms of action and to assess the efficacy of their targets in vivo. The purpose of this paper is to review the recent advances in SRM and to highlight some of its applications in assessing subcellular drug dynamics.","absorption and transport, distribution, drug design, metabolism and excretion, nanoparticles, super-resolution microscopy",Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews,optic microscop import imag tool effect advanc develop modern biomedicin recent year microscopi srm becom one popular techniqu life scienc especi field live cell imag srm use solv mani problem basic biolog research great potenti clinic applic particular use srm studi drug deliveri kinet subcellular level enabl research better studi drug mechan action assess efficaci target vivo purpos paper review recent advanc srm highlight applic assess subcellular drug dynam advanc imag techniqu track drug dynam subcellular level

550,Schirmer Paper Noninvasive Microsampling for Direct Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Human Tears.,"Rapid and sensitive detection of metabolites and chemical residues in human tears is highly beneficial for understanding eye health. In this study, Schirmer paper was used for noninvasive microsampling of human tears, and then paper spray mass spectrometry (PSMS) was performed for direct analysis of human tears. Schirmer PSMS was successfully used for rapid diagnosis of dry-eye syndrome by detecting the volume and metabolites of human tears. Drugs of abuse, therapeutic drugs, and pharmacodynamics in human tears were also investigated by Schirmer PSMS. Furthermore, specific markers of environmental exposures in the air to human eyes, including volatile organic compounds, aerosol, and smoke, were unambiguously sampled and detected in human tears using Schirmer PSMS. Excellent analytical performances were achieved, including single-use, low-sample consumption (1.0 μL), rapid analysis (the whole analytical procedure completed within 3 min), high sensitivity (absolute limit of detection less than or equal to 0.5 pg, signal-to-noise ratio greater than or equal to 3), good reproducibility (relative standard deviation less than 10%, <i>n</i> = 3), and accurate quantitation (average deviation less than 3%, <i>n</i> = 3). Overall, our results showed that Schirmer PSMS is a highly effective method for direct tear analysis and is expected to be a convenient tool for human tear analysis in significant clinical applications.",no keywords,Analytical Chemistry,rapid sensit detect metabolit chemic residu human tear highli benefici understand eye health studi schirmer paper use noninvas microsampl human tear paper spray mass spectrometri psm perform direct analysi human tear schirmer psm success use rapid diagnosi syndrom detect volum metabolit human tear drug abus therapeut drug pharmacodynam human tear also investig schirmer psm furthermor specif marker environment exposur air human eye includ volatil organ compound aerosol smoke unambigu sampl detect human tear use schirmer psm excel analyt perform achiev includ consumpt μl rapid analysi whole analyt procedur complet within min high sensit absolut limit detect less equal pg ratio greater equal good reproduc rel standard deviat less n accur quantit averag deviat less n overal result show schirmer psm highli effect method direct tear analysi expect conveni tool human tear analysi signific clinic applic schirmer paper noninvas microsampl direct mass spectrometri analysi human tear
551,The use of differential scanning calorimetry for the purity verification of pharmaceutical reference standards.,"Reference standards are routinely used in pharmaceutical industry to determine strength, content, and the quality of drug products, active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), preservatives, antioxidants and excipients. Traditionally, chromatographic techniques such as High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and Gas Chromatography (GC) in conjunction with other analytical techniques have been used to determine the purity and strength of a specific lot of a compound for the purpose of qualifying the lot to use as a reference standard. The assigned purity of the reference standard for a wide variety of compounds can be verified using an absolute method such as Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). In this paper, purity of 16 reference standards was determined by DSC and the results were then compared to the purity values that were obtained using HPLC and other analytical techniques. The results indicate that the purity obtained from DSC analysis is comparable to the chromatographic purity for organic compounds that are at least 98% pure. Use of DSC for purity determination is not appropriate if a compound lacks sharp melting point, decomposes in the defined temperature range or exhibits other thermal event(s) which interfere with the melting point of the compound. The use of DSC as an alternative and or complementary method to verify the purity of a compound as part of the pharmaceutical reference standard certification process is discussed.",no keywords,Journal Of Pharmaceutical And Biomedical Analysis,refer standard routin use pharmaceut industri determin strength content qualiti drug product activ pharmaceut ingredi api preserv antioxid excipi tradit chromatograph techniqu high perform liquid chromatographi hplc ga chromatographi gc conjunct analyt techniqu use determin puriti strength specif lot compound purpos qualifi lot use refer standard assign puriti refer standard wide varieti compound verifi use absolut method differenti scan calorimetri dsc paper puriti refer standard determin dsc result compar puriti valu obtain use hplc analyt techniqu result indic puriti obtain dsc analysi compar chromatograph puriti organ compound least pure use dsc puriti determin appropri compound lack sharp melt point decompos defin temperatur rang exhibit thermal event interfer melt point compound use dsc altern complementari method verifi puriti compound part pharmaceut refer standard certif process discus use differenti scan calorimetri puriti verif pharmaceut refer standard
552,Quantitation of parent drug and its unstable metabolites by in situ coulometric oxidation and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.,"Recent FDA and ICH guidances on safety testing of drug metabolites have challenged the way we traditionally think about quantitative bioanalytical methods. Such assays, in general, require a reference standard for each analyte to construct calibration curves and prepare quality control samples. However, early in the drug development process, metabolite standards may not be readily available, and if they are inherently unstable, they are difficult to synthesize or purify. In this paper, we describe a novel in-line method for producing and then quantifying a very unstable metabolite which is based upon the in situ postcolumn coulometric oxidation of the parent drug. Lacking any metabolite standards, the feasibility of simultaneously quantifying a development drug (compound A) and its unstable hydroxylated metabolites (metabolite B) was investigated. Reference standards for these ostensibly major human metabolites could not be reliably obtained due to rapid degradation upon purification and/or subsequent storage. Following high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation, parent drug and its [(13)C(3)-(15)N] isotopically labeled internal standard were quantitatively converted to equal amounts of a diastereomeric pair of hydroxylated metabolites using a postcolumn coulometric electrochemical cell before reaching the mass spectrometer. The concentration of the injected parent (which is equal to the total concentration of the in-line generated metabolites since the conversion to metabolite is quantitative) and the tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) signals of the electrochemically generated metabolites were used to construct a calibration curve for quantifying both the parent drug and its hydroxylated metabolites. Plasma extracts from humans dosed with compound A contained chromatographically distinct liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) signals (m/z 538) for in vivo formed hydroxylated metabolites and the electrochemically oxidized parent drug which had been converted in-line into its chemically identical twin. Both peaks in this study sample could be quantified using a single calibration curve obtained under the same coulometric conditions using known amounts of the parent drug. Although no attempt was made to fully validate a bioanalytical method, the practicality of this in situ quantification approach was further confirmed by the preliminary bioanalytical analysis of a selection of plasma samples collected following oral administration (50 mg) of compound A in a clinical study.",no keywords,Analytical Chemistry,recent fda ich guidanc safeti test drug metabolit challeng way tradit think quantit bioanalyt method assay gener requir refer standard analyt construct calibr curv prepar qualiti control sampl howev earli drug develop process metabolit standard may readili avail inher unstabl difficult synthes purifi paper describ novel method produc quantifi unstabl metabolit base upon situ postcolumn coulometr oxid parent drug lack metabolit standard feasibl simultan quantifi develop drug compound unstabl hydroxyl metabolit metabolit b investig refer standard ostens major human metabolit could reliabl obtain due rapid degrad upon purif subsequ storag follow liquid chromatographi hplc separ parent drug c n isotop label intern standard quantit convert equal amount diastereomer pair hydroxyl metabolit use postcolumn coulometr electrochem cell reach mass spectromet concentr inject parent equal total concentr gener metabolit sinc convers metabolit quantit tandem mass spectrometri signal electrochem gener metabolit use construct calibr curv quantifi parent drug hydroxyl metabolit plasma extract human dose compound contain chromatograph distinct liquid spectrometri signal vivo form hydroxyl metabolit electrochem oxid parent drug convert chemic ident twin peak studi sampl could quantifi use singl calibr curv obtain coulometr condit use known amount parent drug although attempt made fulli valid bioanalyt method practic situ quantif approach confirm preliminari bioanalyt analysi select plasma sampl collect follow oral administr mg compound clinic studi quantit parent drug unstabl metabolit situ coulometr oxid liquid mass spectrometri
553,Age and sex differences in pharmaceutical contamination in a keystone scavenger.,"Pharmaceutical contaminants have a recognized negative impact on wildlife health. However, there are still many knowledge gaps on the factors influencing exposure and metabolic processing of compound mixtures as a function of season and individual characteristics such as age and sex. We evaluated age and sex differences in a set of seventeen compounds, including eleven antibiotics, five NSAIDs and caffeine, evaluated by HPLC-MS-TOF analysis in griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus) from central Spain. Pharmaceutical cocktails (up to 10 compounds simultaneously) were found in all individuals. Lincomycin was detected in all individuals, and fluoroquinolones were found at high frequencies, while NSAIDs were at low frequencies and concentrations, including flumixin meglumine, which can be lethal to vultures. A higher total number of compounds and sum of concentrations, as well as prevalence and concentration of several of the pharmaceuticals tested was found in females than in males for both nestlings and adults. This is the first study to present evidence of sex differences in the pharmacokinetics of dietary drug contaminants in a vulture species. Chronic exposure to ""medications"" in entire populations can potentially have sub-lethal health effects that affect fitness differently according to age and sex, with demographic implications for population viability. Specifically, if females have higher mortality after fledging due to high pharmaceutical contamination, this should be considered when modelling the population dynamic of this species for conservation purposes.","demographic impact, livestock management, pharmacokinetics, sexual differences, veterinary drugs, vultures, wildlife conservation",Environmental Research,pharmaceut contamin recogn neg impact wildlif health howev still mani knowledg gap factor influenc exposur metabol process compound mixtur function season individu characterist age sex evalu age sex differ set seventeen compound includ eleven antibiot five nsaid caffein evalu analysi griffon vultur gyp fulvu central spain pharmaceut cocktail compound simultan found individu lincomycin detect individu fluoroquinolon found high frequenc nsaid low frequenc concentr includ flumixin meglumin lethal vultur higher total number compound sum concentr well preval concentr sever pharmaceut test found femal male nestl adult first studi present evid sex differ pharmacokinet dietari drug contamin vultur speci chronic exposur medic entir popul potenti health effect affect fit differ accord age sex demograph implic popul viabil specif femal higher mortal fledg due high pharmaceut contamin consid model popul dynam speci conserv purpos age sex differ pharmaceut contamin keyston scaveng

558,Dropwise additive manufacturing of pharmaceutical products for amorphous and self emulsifying drug delivery systems.,"The improvements in healthcare systems and the advent of the precision medicine initiative have created the need to develop more innovative manufacturing methods for the delivery and production of individualized dosing and personalized treatments. In accordance with the changes observed in healthcare systems towards more innovative therapies, this paper presents dropwise additive manufacturing of pharmaceutical products (DAMPP) for small scale, distributed manufacturing of individualized dosing as an alternative to conventional manufacturing methods A dropwise additive manufacturing process for amorphous and self-emulsifying drug delivery systems is reported, which utilizes drop-on-demand printing technology for automated and controlled deposition of melt-based formulations onto inert tablets. The advantages of drop on demand technology include reproducible production of droplets with adjustable sizing and high placement accuracy, which enable production of individualized dosing even for low dose and high potency drugs. Flexible use of different formulations, such as lipid-based formulations, allows enhancement of the solubility of poorly water soluble and highly lipophilic drugs with DAMPP. Here, DAMPP is used to produce solid oral dosage forms from melts of an active pharmaceutical ingredient and a surfactant. The dosage forms are analyzed to show the amorphous nature, self-emulsifying drug delivery system characteristics and dissolution behavior of these formulations.","amorphous, drug printing, oral drug delivery, processing, quality by design (qbd), self-emulsifying drug delivery system, solid dispersion, solid dosage form, surfactants",International Journal Of Pharmaceutics,improv healthcar system advent precis medicin initi creat need develop innov manufactur method deliveri product individu dose person treatment accord chang observ healthcar system toward innov therapi paper present dropwis addit manufactur pharmaceut product dampp small scale distribut manufactur individu dose altern convent manufactur method dropwis addit manufactur process amorph drug deliveri system report util print technolog autom control deposit formul onto inert tablet advantag drop demand technolog includ reproduc product droplet adjust size high placement accuraci enabl product individu dose even low dose high potenc drug flexibl use differ formul formul allow enhanc solubl poorli water solubl highli lipophil drug dampp dampp use produc solid oral dosag form melt activ pharmaceut ingredi surfact dosag form analyz show amorph natur drug deliveri system characterist dissolut behavior formul dropwis addit manufactur pharmaceut product amorph self emulsifi drug deliveri system
559,Robust identification of significant interactions between toxicogenomic biomarkers and their regulatory chemical compounds using logistic moving range chart.,"Identification of significant interactions between genes and chemical compounds/drugs is an important issue in toxicogenomic studies as well as in drug discovery and development. There are some online and offline computational tools for toxicogenomic data analysis to identify the biomarker genes and their regulatory chemical compounds/drugs. However, none of the researchers has considered yet the identification of significant interactions between genes and compounds. Therefore, in this paper, we have discussed two approaches namely moving range chart (MRC) and logistic moving range chart (LMRC) for the identification of significant up-regulatory (UpR) and down-regulatory (DnR) gene-compound interactions as well as toxicogenomic biomarkers and their regulatory chemical compounds/drugs. We have investigated the performance of both MRC and LMRC approaches using simulated datasets. Simulation results show that both approaches perform almost equally in absence of outliers. However, in presence of outliers, the LMRC shows much better performance than the MRC. In case of real life toxicogenomic data analysis, the proposed LMRC approach detected some important down-regulated biomarker genes those were not detected by other approaches. Therefore, in this paper, our proposal is to use LMRC for robust identification of significant interactions between genes and chemical compounds/drugs.","fold change gene expression, gene-compound interaction, logistic transformation, moving range chart, toxicogenomic data",Computational Biology And Chemistry,identif signific interact gene chemic import issu toxicogenom studi well drug discoveri develop onlin offlin comput tool toxicogenom data analysi identifi biomark gene regulatori chemic howev none research consid yet identif signific interact gene compound therefor paper discus two approach name move rang chart mrc logist move rang chart lmrc identif signific upr dnr interact well toxicogenom biomark regulatori chemic investig perform mrc lmrc approach use simul dataset simul result show approach perform almost equal absenc outlier howev presenc outlier lmrc show much better perform mrc case real life toxicogenom data analysi propos lmrc approach detect import biomark gene detect approach therefor paper propos use lmrc robust identif signific interact gene chemic robust identif signific interact toxicogenom biomark regulatori chemic compound use logist move rang chart

562,Analysis of basic compounds by supercritical fluid chromatography: attempts to improve peak shape and maintain mass spectrometry compatibility.,"While neutral and acidic compounds are well separated by supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC), basic analytes are more challenging to separate and often problems occur with their peak shapes. Two different methods were explored in the present paper to reduce these problems and maintain compatibility with mass spectrometry (MS). Five different, commercially available 2-ethylpyridine (2-EP) stationary phases were tested without a mobile phase additive using 92 pharmaceutical compounds with basic properties. The kinetic performances of the 5 columns were nearly identical, but the peak shapes of the basic drugs were strongly affected by the stationary phase. The PrincetonSFC 2-EP and Zymor Pegasus 2-EP phases clearly outperformed the other stationary phases, with 77% and 69% of the compounds having Gaussian peaks (and asymmetries between 0.8 and 1.4), respectively. Comparatively, the Waters Viridis Silica 2-EP, Waters Viridis BEH 2-EP and ES industries GreenSep 2-EP phases provided only 52%, 44% and 22% of the compounds with Gaussian peaks, respectively. These differences were attributed to the significant dissimilarities in their silica matrix properties. An alternative strategy was also performed with a hybrid silica stationary phase, Viridis BEH, using 20mM ammonium hydroxide in the mobile phase, which was a mixture of CO(2) and MeOH. With these conditions, 81% of the peaks observed for the basic analytes were Gaussian; however, this value dropped to 17% and 10% in the absence of additive and in the presence of 20mM formic acid, respectively. Finally, the use of a hybrid bare silica stationary phase in the presence of 20mM ammonium hydroxide is quite an interesting solution as this system is compatible with both ultra high performance SFC (UHPSFC) columns packed with sub-2 μm particles and with MS detection. The overall applicability of this system was demonstrated with various mixtures of basic drugs.",no keywords,Journal Of Chromatography.

563,Automatic flow delay through passive wax valves for paper-based analytical devices.,"Microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (μPADs) have been widely explored for point-of-care testing due to their simplicity, low cost, and portability. μPADs with multiple-step reactions usually require precise flow control, especially flow-delay. This paper reports the numerical, mathematical, and experimental studies of flow delay through wax valves surrounded by PDMS walls on paper microfluidics. The predried surfactant in the sample zone diffuses into the liquid sample which can therefore flow through the wax valves. The delay time is automatically regulated by the diffusion of the surfactant after sample loading. The numerical study suggested that both the elevated contact angle and the reduced porosity and pore size in the wax printed region could effectively prevent water but allow liquids with lower contact angles (<i>e.g.</i>, surfactant solutions) to flow through. The PDMS walls fabricated using a low-cost liquid dispenser effectively prevented the leakage of surfactant solutions. By controlling the quantity, diffusion distance, and type of the surfactant predried on the chip, the system successfully achieved a delay time ranging from 1.6 to 20 minutes. A mathematical model involving the above parameters was developed based on Fick's second law to predict the delay time. Finally, the flow-delay systems were applied in sequential mixing and distance-based detection of either glucose or alcohol. Linear ranges of 1-100 mg dL<sup>-1</sup> and 1-40 mg dL<sup>-1</sup> were achieved for glucose and alcohol, respectively. The lower limit detection (LOD) of glucose and alcohol was 1 mg dL<sup>-1</sup>. The LOD of glucose was only 1/11 of that detected using μPADs without flow control, indicating the advantage of controlling fluid flow. The systematic findings in this study provide critical guidelines for the development and applications of wax valves in automatic flow delay for point-of-care testing.",no keywords,Lab On A Chip,microfluid analyt devic μpad wide explor test due simplic low cost portabl μpad reaction usual requir precis flow control especi paper report numer mathemat experiment studi flow delay wax valv surround pdm wall paper microfluid predri surfact sampl zone diffus liquid sampl therefor flow wax valv delay time automat regul diffus surfact sampl load numer studi suggest elev contact angl reduc poros pore size wax print region could effect prevent water allow liquid lower contact angl surfact solut flow pdm wall fabric use liquid dispens effect prevent leakag surfact solut control quantiti diffus distanc type surfact predri chip system success achiev delay time rang minut mathemat model involv paramet develop base fick second law predict delay time final system appli sequenti mix detect either glucos alcohol linear rang mg dl sup mg dl sup achiev glucos alcohol respect lower limit detect lod glucos alcohol mg dl sup lod glucos detect use μpad without flow control indic advantag control fluid flow systemat find studi provid critic guidelin develop applic wax valv automat flow delay test automat flow delay passiv wax valv analyt devic
564,Pharmaceutical applications of AC biosusceptometry.,"AC Biosusceptometry offers an alternative to investigate noninvasively and without ionizing radiation the behavior of solid dosage forms in vitro and in the human gastrointestinal tract. This versatility allowed applying this technique in a wide field ranging from characterization of the disintegration process to elucidation of how the physiological parameters can interfere with pharmaceutical processes. It is increasingly important to understand how oral solid dosage forms behave in the human gastrointestinal tract.

566,Improvement of microemulsion electrokinetic chromatography for measuring octanol-water partition coefficients.,"Microemulsion electrokinetic chromatography (MEEKC) has been used to indirectly measure octanol-water partition coefficients (log P(ow)) of compounds. In order to obtain an accurate log P(ow) value, the electrophoretic mobilities of the microemulsion phase (mu(me)) and the analyte (mu(eff)) in MEEKC must be accurately required. However, in conventional MEEKC, the shortage of obtaining mu(me) with a tracing method was discovered, and the influences of concentration, injection volume of analyte, and high electric field on measuring mu(eff) were also found. In this paper, a novel method called improved MEEKC (I-MEEKC) was developed to avoid the problems mentioned above. In I-MEEKC, a nonlinearity fitting program was used to obtain mu(me) to avoid the error from tracing mu(me); the extrapolating method was used to eliminate the effects of concentrations and injection volumes of analytes on mu(eff) measurement, and an enough stable microemulsion was selected to eliminate the effect of high electric field on mu(eff )measurement. Then the novel method was applied to estimate log P(ow) of uncharged compounds and charged pharmaceuticals compared to the conventional MEEKC. The log P(ow) of all analytes obtained by I-MEEKC agreed with those obtained by classical shake flask or literature values, the errors between them were within 0.1 logarithm units, better than the ones by conventional MEEKC.",no keywords,Electrophoresis,microemuls electrokinet chromatographi meekc use indirectli measur partit coeffici log p ow compound order obtain accur log p ow valu electrophoret mobil microemuls phase mu analyt mu eff meekc must accur requir howev convent meekc shortag obtain mu trace method discov influenc concentr inject volum analyt high electr field measur mu eff also found paper novel method call improv meekc develop avoid problem mention nonlinear fit program use obtain mu avoid error trace mu extrapol method use elimin effect concentr inject volum analyt mu eff measur enough stabl microemuls select elimin effect high electr field mu eff measur novel method appli estim log p ow uncharg compound charg pharmaceut compar convent meekc log p ow analyt obtain agre obtain classic shake flask literatur valu error within logarithm unit better one convent meekc improv microemuls electrokinet chromatographi measur partit coeffici
567,"Implementation of the Patient Counselling Service at the Cancer Hospital in Radom, Poland.","<b>Background:</b> Non-adherence occurs in various groups of patients, including those with chronic diseases. One strategy to increase adherence among oncological patients is to individualise treatment and expand pharmaceutical care. Pharmaceutical labels that remind patients how they should take their medications are of great importance in this respect. <b>Objective:</b> The main objective of this study was to evaluate medication adherence in oncological patients, and to gather their opinions on the individual medication labelling system as an element of effective treatment. <b>Methods:</b> The study was conducted in 2021 among 82 patients of the oncological department of the Centre of Oncology in Radom. The research tool was a questionnaire consisting of personal data and two parts relating to the patient's disease and the medication labelling system. <b>Results:</b> Nearly half of the respondents reported that they forget to take medications and how they should take them. These problems increased with the age of the patient and the number of administered medications. Of the respondents, 89% stated that the labels with dosing information are helpful. Over 67% agreed that these labels should be affixed to all medications. Nearly 90% of the respondents believed the labels should be available in all pharmacies. <b>Conclusions:</b> Non-adherence is a common phenomenon among oncological patients.

568,How smart medication systems are used to support older people's drug regimens: A systematic literature review.,"Smart medication systems are used to help older people, and the professionals and family who care for them, to organize and manage their daily drug regimes. However, synthetized knowledge on previous studies about how these improve everyday life is needed. We searched the PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, PsycINFO, SocINDEX and Cochrane library databases from 2005 to 2019 and this review focused on nine of the 2,424 papers we identified. According to our analysis, smart medication systems make it possible to regulate medication times and doses and detect medication errors. With further development, smart medication systems could be more be effective at preventing medication errors, improving medication adherence by older people and freeing up healthcare professional, so that they can focus on other tasks. However, more research on different systems is needed to improve existing solutions and to understand how they can make older people more independent when it comes to their daily medication.","home care, older people, smart medication system, systematic review, technology","Geriatric Nursing (New York, N.Y.)",smart medic system use help older peopl profession famili care organ manag daili drug regim howev synthet knowledg previou studi improv everyday life need search pubm scopu cinahl psycinfo socindex cochran librari databas review focus nine paper identifi accord analysi smart medic system make possibl regul medic time dose detect medic error develop smart medic system could effect prevent medic error improv medic adher older peopl free healthcar profession focu task howev research differ system need improv exist solut understand make older peopl independ come daili medic smart medic system use support older peopl drug regimen systemat literatur review
569,An integrated lateral flow assay for effective DNA amplification and detection at the point of care.,"Lateral flow assays (LFAs) have been extensively explored in nucleic acid testing (NAT) for medical diagnostics, food safety analysis and environmental monitoring. However, the amount of target nucleic acid in a raw sample is usually too low to be directly detected by LFAs, necessitating the process of amplification. Even though cost-effective paper-based amplification techniques have been introduced, they have always been separately performed from LFAs, hence increasing the risk of reagent loss and cross-contaminations. To date, integrating paper-based nucleic acid amplification into colorimetric LFA in a simple, portable and cost-effective manner has not been introduced. Herein, we developed an integrated LFA with the aid of a specially designed handheld battery-powered system for effective amplification and detection of targets in resource-poor settings. Interestingly, using the integrated paper-based loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP)-LFA, we successfully performed highly sensitive and specific target detection, achieving a detection limit of as low as 3 × 10(3) copies of target DNA, which is comparable to the conventional tube-based LAMP-LFA in an unintegrated format. The device may serve in conjunction with a simple paper-based sample preparation to create a fully integrated paper-based sample-to-answer diagnostic device for point-of-care testing (POCT) in the near future.",no keywords,The Analyst,later flow assay lfa extens explor nucleic acid test nat medic diagnost food safeti analysi environment monitor howev amount target nucleic acid raw sampl usual low directli detect lfa necessit process amplif even though amplif techniqu introduc alway separ perform lfa henc increas risk reagent loss date integr nucleic acid amplif colorimetr lfa simpl portabl manner introduc herein develop integr lfa aid special design handheld system effect amplif detect target set interestingli use integr isotherm amplif lamp success perform highli sensit specif target detect achiev detect limit low copi target dna compar convent unintegr format devic may serv conjunct simpl sampl prepar creat fulli integr diagnost devic test poct near futur integr later flow assay effect dna amplif detect point care
570,LC-MS quantification of protein drugs: validating protein LC-MS methods with predigestion immunocapture.,"A refinement of protein LC-MS bioanalysis is to use predigestion immunoaffinity capture to extract the drug from matrix prior to digestion. Because of their increased sensitivity, such hybrid assays have been successfully validated and applied to a number of clinical studies; however, they can also be subject to potential interferences from antidrug antibodies, circulating ligands or other matrix components specific to patient populations and/or dosed subjects. The purpose of this paper is to describe validation experiments that measure immunocapture efficiency, digestion efficiency, matrix effect and selectivity/specificity that can be used during method optimization and validation to test the resistance of the method to these potential interferences. The designs and benefits of these experiments are discussed in this report using an actual assay case study.","gxp bioanalysis, assay matrix effects, bioanalytical validation, digestion efficiency, hybrid bioanalysis, immunocapture, protein bioanalysis, protein drug validation, regulated bioanalysis, selectivity",Bioanalysis,refin protein bioanalysi use predigest immunoaffin captur extract drug matrix prior digest increas sensit hybrid assay success valid appli number clinic studi howev also subject potenti interfer antidrug antibodi circul ligand matrix compon specif patient popul dose subject purpos paper describ valid experi measur immunocaptur effici digest effici matrix effect use method optim valid test resist method potenti interfer design benefit experi discus report use actual assay case studi quantif protein drug valid protein method predigest immunocaptur
571,Interest of achiral-achiral tandem columns for impurity profiling of synthetic drugs with supercritical fluid chromatography.,"To achieve the most complete impurity profiling of synthetic drugs with a single chromatographic technique, high resolution is required, which may be gained with a combination of high efficiency and versatile selectivity, allowing to separate most similar analytes. Compared to a single-column chromatographic method, coupling complementary stationary phases promises both an increase in efficiency and an increase in selectivity possibilities. With supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC), the use of long columns is facilitated by the low viscosity of the mobile phase. In this paper, we investigate the interest of coupling two achiral stationary phases (Acquity UPC<sup>2</sup> HSS C18 SB and Nucleoshell HILIC) that were previously observed to have excellent complementarity in SFC to carry out impurity profiling on 25 individual drug substances containing varied numbers and amounts of impurities. The single-column gradient methods are compared to tandem-column gradient methods with the two possible ordering of columns (C18 phase in first or second position) based on selectivity, peak capacity, sensitivity, UV-estimated purity of the active pharmaceutical ingredient and number of impurities detected with UV-estimated concentration >0.04%. It appears that it could be more beneficial to have two columns coupled in a single analysis than two consecutive methods with the single columns. The overall analysis time are nearly the same, but with more informative chromatograms in about 35% cases.","high-resolution separations, impurity profiling, orthogonal methods, performance comparison, pharmaceutical ingredients, tandem columns",Journal Of Chromatography.

573,Identification and characterization of reactive metabolites in natural products-driven drug discovery.,"Toxicity of natural products arising from their metabolic biotransformation into reactive chemical intermediates is an important reason for high attrition rates in early drug discovery efforts. Screening promising natural products for their likelihood to form such metabolites is therefore an important step in identifying potential liabilities in the drug development process. However, such screening is complicated by the need to have test methods that are sensitive, reliable, accurate, efficient, and cost-effective enough to allow for routine identification and characterization of the reactive metabolites. These metabolites are typically formed in minute quantities, usually through minor metabolic pathways, and, due to their highly reactive and therefore transient chemical nature, pose considerable analytical challenges in attempts to determine their properties. Understanding the formation of reactive metabolites may be used as the basis for synthetic chemical modification of parent natural products aimed at bypassing such harmful bioactivation. This paper highlights the general principles and protocols commonly used to predict and study the formation of reactive metabolites in vitro and how the data obtained from such studies can be used in the development of safer drugs from natural products.",no keywords,Journal Of Natural Products,toxic natur product aris metabol biotransform reactiv chemic intermedi import reason high attrit rate earli drug discoveri effort screen promis natur product likelihood form metabolit therefor import step identifi potenti liabil drug develop process howev screen complic need test method sensit reliabl accur effici enough allow routin identif character reactiv metabolit metabolit typic form minut quantiti usual minor metabol pathway due highli reactiv therefor transient chemic natur pose consider analyt challeng attempt determin properti understand format reactiv metabolit may use basi synthet chemic modif parent natur product aim bypass harm bioactiv paper highlight gener principl protocol commonli use predict studi format reactiv metabolit vitro data obtain studi use develop safer drug natur product identif character reactiv metabolit natur drug discoveri

Starting from a standard method with a quantitation limit of 0.5 ng/mL, a highly sensitive assay was developed, employing UHPLC separation and detection on an API 5000 mass spectrometer. The injected plasma equivalent was increased from 6 to 20 μL; conventional column trapping for compound enrichment and removal of matrix constituents was combined with high-pressure analytical separation using small particle columns to improve resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. Quantitation limits were thus lowered to between 5 and 20 pg/mL, offering the possibility to provide bioanalytical support for microdosing studies in humans. Excellent assay quality and robustness were achieved by both methods.",no keywords,Journal Of Pharmaceutical And Biomedical Analysis,paper describ determin drug candid two metabolit human plasma protein precipit start standard method quantit limit highli sensit assay develop employ uhplc separ detect api mass spectromet inject plasma equival increas μl convent column trap compound enrich remov matrix constitu combin analyt separ use small particl column improv resolut ratio quantit limit thu lower offer possibl provid bioanalyt support microdos studi human excel assay qualiti robust achiev method sensit determin pharmaceut compound metabolit human plasma perform liquid mass spectrometri extract

579,A mass spectrometry method for the determination of the species of origin of gelatine in foods and pharmaceutical products.,"Gelatine is a component of a wide range of foods. It is manufactured as a by-product of the meat industry from bone and hide, mainly from bovine and porcine sources. Accurate food labelling enables consumers to make informed decisions about the food they buy. Since labelling currently relies heavily on due diligence involving a paper trail, there could be benefits in developing a reliable test method for the consumer industries in terms of the species origin of gelatine. We present a method to determine the species origin of gelatines by peptide mass spectrometry methods. An evaluative comparison is also made with ELISA and PCR technologies. Commercial gelatines were found to contain undeclared species. Furthermore, undeclared bovine peptides were observed in commercial injection matrices. This analytical method could therefore support the food industry in terms of determining the species authenticity of gelatine in foods.","authenticity, bovine, gelatine, porcine, spectrometry",Food Chemistry,gelatin compon wide rang food manufactur meat industri bone hide mainli bovin porcin sourc accur food label enabl consum make inform decis food buy sinc label current reli heavili due dilig involv paper trail could benefit develop reliabl test method consum industri term speci origin gelatin present method determin speci origin gelatin peptid mass spectrometri method evalu comparison also made elisa pcr technolog commerci gelatin found contain undeclar speci furthermor undeclar bovin peptid observ commerci inject matric analyt method could therefor support food industri term determin speci authent gelatin food mass spectrometri method determin speci origin gelatin food pharmaceut product

581,Regional intestinal drug permeation: biopharmaceutics and drug development.,"Over the last 25 years, profound changes have been seen in both the development and regulation of pharmaceutical dosage forms, due primarily to the extensive use of the biopharmaceutical classification system (BCS) in both academia and industry. The BCS and the FDA scale-up and post-approval change guidelines were both developed during the 1990s and both are currently widely used to claim biowaivers. The development of the BCS and its wide acceptance were important steps in pharmaceutical science that contributed to the more rational development of oral dosage forms. The effective permeation (Peff) of drugs through the intestine often depends on the combined outcomes of passive diffusion and multiple parallel transport processes. Site-specific jejunal Peff cannot reflect the permeability of the whole intestinal tract, since this varies along the length of the intestine, but is a useful approximation of the fraction of the oral dose that is absorbed. It appears that drugs with a jejunal Peff>1.5×10(-4)cm/s will be completely absorbed no matter which transport mechanisms are utilized. In this paper, historical clinical data originating from earlier open, single-pass perfusion studies have been used to calculate the Peff of different substances from sites in the jejunum and ileum. More exploratory in vivo studies are required in order to obtain reliable data on regional intestinal drug absorption. The development of experimental and theoretical methods of assessing drug absorption from both small intestine and various sites in the colon is encouraged. Some of the existing human in vivo data are discussed in relation to commonly used cell culture models. It is crucial to accurately determine the input parameters, such as the regional intestinal Peff, as these will form the basis for the expected increase in modeling and simulation of all the processes involved in GI drug absorption, thus facilitating successful pharmaceutical development in the future. It is suggested that it would be feasible to use open, single-pass perfusion studies for the in vivo estimation of regional intestinal Peff, but that care should be taken in the study design to optimize the absorption conditions.","biopharmaceutical classification system, biopharmaceutics, dissolution, drug absorption, ivivc, pbpk",European Journal Of Pharmaceutical Sciences : Official Journal Of The European Federation For Pharmaceutical Sciences,last year profound chang seen develop regul pharmaceut dosag form due primarili extens use biopharmaceut classif system bc academia industri bc fda chang guidelin develop current wide use claim biowaiv develop bc wide accept import step pharmaceut scienc contribut ration develop oral dosag form effect permeat peff drug intestin often depend combin outcom passiv diffus multipl parallel transport process jejun peff reflect permeabl whole intestin tract sinc vari along length intestin use approxim fraction oral dose absorb appear drug jejun peff complet absorb matter transport mechan util paper histor clinic data origin earlier open perfus studi use calcul peff differ substanc site jejunum ileum exploratori vivo studi requir order obtain reliabl data region intestin drug absorpt develop experiment theoret method assess drug absorpt small intestin variou site colon encourag exist human vivo data discus relat commonli use cell cultur model crucial accur determin input paramet region intestin peff form basi expect increas model simul process involv gi drug absorpt thu facilit success pharmaceut develop futur suggest would feasibl use open perfus studi vivo estim region intestin peff care taken studi design optim absorpt condit region intestin drug permeat biopharmaceut drug develop
582,Ambient Ionization Mass Spectrometry: Application and Prospective.,"Mass spectrometry (MS) is a formidable analytical tool for the analysis of non-polar to polar compounds individually and/or from mixtures, providing information on the molecular weights and chemical structures of the analytes. During the last more than one-decade, ambient ionization mass spectrometry (AIMS) has developed quickly, producing a wide range of platforms and proving scientific improvements in a variety of domains, from biological imaging to quick quality control. These methods have made it possible to detect target analytes in real time without sample preparation in an open environment, and they can be connected to any MS system with an atmospheric pressure interface. They also have the ability to analyze explosives, illicit drugs, disease diagnostics, drugs in biological samples, adulterants in food and agricultural products, reaction progress, and environmental monitoring. The development of novel ambient ionization techniques, such as probe electrospray ionization, paper spray ionization, and fiber spray ionization, employed even at picolitre to femtolitre solution levels to provide femtogram to attogram levels of the target analytes. The special characteristic of this ambient ion source, which has been extensively used, is the noninvasive property of PESI of examination of biological real samples. The results in the current review supports the idea that AIMS has emerged as a pioneer in MS-based approaches and that methods will continue to be developed along with improvements to existing ones in the near future.","ambient mass spectrometry, high throughput analysis",Critical Reviews In Analytical Chemistry,mass spectrometri m formid analyt tool analysi polar compound individu mixtur provid inform molecular weight chemic structur analyt last ambient ioniz mass spectrometri aim develop quickli produc wide rang platform prove scientif improv varieti domain biolog imag quick qualiti control method made possibl detect target analyt real time without sampl prepar open environ connect m system atmospher pressur interfac also abil analyz explos illicit drug diseas diagnost drug biolog sampl adulter food agricultur product reaction progress environment monitor develop novel ambient ioniz techniqu probe electrospray ioniz paper spray ioniz fiber spray ioniz employ even picolitr femtolitr solut level provid femtogram attogram level target analyt special characterist ambient ion sourc extens use noninvas properti pesi examin biolog real sampl result current review support idea aim emerg pioneer approach method continu develop along improv exist one near futur ambient ioniz mass spectrometri applic prospect

Biomarkers are not only utilized for internal decision-making by sponsors; they are increasingly utilized to make critical decisions for drug safety and efficacy. As the regulatory agencies are routinely making decisions based on biomarker data, there has been significant scrutiny on the validation of biomarker methods. Contract research organizations regularly use commercially available immunoassay kits to validate biomarker methods. However, adaptation of such kits in a regulated environment presents significant challenges and was one of the key topics discussed during the 12th Global Contract Research Organization Council for Bioanalysis (GCC) meeting. This White Paper reports the GCC members' opinion on the challenges facing the industry and the GCC recommendations on the classification of commercial kits that can be a win-win for commercial kit vendors and end users.","bav, cro, gcc, lba, bioanalysis, biomarkers, commercial kits, immunoassay",Bioanalysis,last decad use biomark data becom integr drug develop biomark util intern sponsor increasingli util make critic decis drug safeti efficaci regulatori agenc routin make decis base biomark data signific scrutini valid biomark method contract research organ regularli use commerci avail immunoassay kit valid biomark method howev adapt kit regul environ present signific challeng one key topic discus global contract research organ council bioanalysi gcc meet white paper report gcc member opinion challeng face industri gcc recommend classif commerci kit commerci kit vendor end user recommend classif commerci lba kit biomark drug develop gcc bioanalysi
585,Exploring Tunable Hyperparameters for Deep Neural Networks with Industrial ADME Data Sets.,"Deep learning has drawn significant attention in different areas including drug discovery. It has been proposed that it could outperform other machine learning algorithms, especially with big data sets. In the field of pharmaceutical industry, machine learning models are built to understand quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) and predict molecular activities, including absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties, using only molecular structures. Previous reports have demonstrated the advantages of using deep neural networks (DNNs) for QSAR modeling. One of the challenges while building DNN models is identifying the hyperparameters that lead to better generalization of the models. In this study, we investigated several tunable hyperparameters of deep neural network models on 24 industrial ADME data sets.

The addition of leucine has exhibited significant enhancing effects on the aerosolization and physical stability of the produced particles. Here, we focus not only on the applications of leucine in inhalable spray-drying powders, but also on the underlying mechanisms by which the formulation and processing parameters dictate the behavior of leucine during the drying process and, therefore, its functionalities within the dried powder. Additionally, we highlight the current regulatory status of leucine. Such insights are important for more efficient utilization of leucine in the future, both for dry powder inhaler formulations and other pharmaceutical applications.","dry powder inhalers, leucine, particle engineering, regulatory considerations, spray drying",Drug Discovery Today,leucin promis excipi sever applic develop inhal powder drug addit leucin exhibit signific enhanc effect aerosol physic stabil produc particl focu applic leucin inhal powder also underli mechan formul process paramet dictat behavior leucin dri process therefor function within dri powder addit highlight current regulatori statu leucin insight import effici util leucin futur dri powder inhal formul pharmaceut applic leucin excipi spray dri powder inhal
588,Analysis and use of fragment-occurrence data in similarity-based virtual screening.,"Current systems for similarity-based virtual screening use similarity measures in which all the fragments in a fingerprint contribute equally to the calculation of structural similarity. This paper discusses the weighting of fragments on the basis of their frequencies of occurrence in molecules. Extensive experiments with sets of active molecules from the MDL Drug Data Report and the World of Molecular Bioactivity databases, using fingerprints encoding Tripos holograms, Pipeline Pilot ECFC_4 circular substructures and Sunset Molecular keys, demonstrate clearly that frequency-based screening is generally more effective than conventional, unweighted screening. The results suggest that standardising the raw occurrence frequencies by taking the square root of the frequencies will maximise the effectiveness of virtual screening. An upper-bound analysis shows the complex interactions that can take place between representations, weighting schemes and similarity coefficients when similarity measures are computed, and provides a rationalisation of the relative performance of the various weighting schemes.",no keywords,Journal Of Computer-Aided Molecular Design,current system virtual screen use similar measur fragment fingerprint contribut equal calcul structur similar paper discus weight fragment basi frequenc occurr molecul extens experi set activ molecul mdl drug data report world molecular bioactiv databas use fingerprint encod tripo hologram pipelin pilot circular substructur sunset molecular key demonstr clearli screen gener effect convent unweight screen result suggest standardis raw occurr frequenc take squar root frequenc maximis effect virtual screen analysi show complex interact take place represent weight scheme similar coeffici similar measur comput provid rationalis rel perform variou weight scheme analysi use data virtual screen
589,Optical diagnostics studies of air flow and powder fluidisation in Nexthaler®. Part II: Use of fluorescent imaging to characterise transient release of fines from a dry powder inhaler.,The fine particle fraction is a key indicator of therapeutic effectiveness of inhaled pharmaceutical aerosols. This paper presents a fluorescence imaging technique to visualise and characterise the emission of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) fines in model formulations containing coarse lactose carrier and 1.5-2 μm diameter fluorescent microspheres (model API fines). A two-camera arrangement was used to acquire simultaneous images of spatial and temporal distribution of model API fines and fluidised powder formulation near the mouthpiece exit of a DPI. Digital image analysis showed that the model API fines were released along with the bulk of the powder dose. More rapidly accelerating airflows were found to cause earlier release of API fines. The fluorescence imaging technique analyses a substantial fraction of the aerosol plume and was found to provide effective time-resolved characterisation of the de-aggregation and release of API fines with consistent results across a wide range of model API concentrations. Future studies should demonstrate the usefulness of the fluorescence imaging technique across different formulations and DPI devices.,"de-aggregation, dry powder inhaler, high-speed fluorescence imaging, optical diagnostics, powder fluidization, model api",International Journal Of Pharmaceutics,fine particl fraction key indic therapeut effect inhal pharmaceut aerosol paper present fluoresc imag techniqu visualis characteris emiss activ pharmaceut ingredi api fine model formul contain coars lactos carrier μm diamet fluoresc microspher model api fine arrang use acquir simultan imag spatial tempor distribut model api fine fluidis powder formul near mouthpiec exit dpi digit imag analysi show model api fine releas along bulk powder dose rapidli acceler airflow found caus earlier releas api fine fluoresc imag techniqu analys substanti fraction aerosol plume found provid effect characteris releas api fine consist result across wide rang model api concentr futur studi demonstr use fluoresc imag techniqu across differ formul dpi devic optic diagnost studi air flow powder fluidis part ii use fluoresc imag characteris transient releas fine dri powder inhal

This review describes important advances in microfluidic lab-on-paper diagnostics for human health monitoring and disease diagnosis over the past five years. The review commenced by explaining the choice of paper, fabrication methods, and detection techniques to realize microfluidic lab-on-paper devices. Then, the sample pretreatment procedure used to improve the detection performance of lab-on-paper devices was introduced. Furthermore, an in-depth review of lab-on-paper devices for disease measurement based on an analysis of urine samples was presented.

593,"Manufacturing classification system in the real world: factors influencing manufacturing process choices for filed commercial oral solid dosage formulations, case studies from industry and considerations for continuous processing.","Following the first Manufacturing Classification System (MCS) paper, the team conducted surveys to establish which active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) properties were important when selecting or modifying materials to enable an efficient and robust pharmaceutical manufacturing process. The most commonly identified factors were (1) API particle size: small particle sizes are known to increase risk of processing issues; (2) Drug loading in the formulation: high drug loadings allow less opportunity to mitigate poor API properties through the use of excipients. The next step was to establish linkages with process decisions by identifying publicly-available proxies for these important parameters: dose (in place of drug loading) and BCS class (in place of particle size). Poorly-soluble API were seen as more likely to have controlled (smaller) particle size than more highly soluble API. Analysis of 435 regulatory filings revealed that higher doses and more poorly-soluble API was associated with more complex processing routes. Replacing the proxy factors with the original parameters should give the opportunity to demonstrate stronger trends. This assumption was tested by accessing a dataset relating to commercial tablet products. This showed that, for dry processes, a larger particle size was associated with higher achievable drug loading as determined by percolation threshold.","drug product manufacturing processes, continuous processing, drug substance, oral solid dosage forms, pharmaceutical development, quality by design",Pharmaceutical Development And Technology,follow first manufactur classif system mc paper team conduct survey establish activ pharmaceut ingredi api properti import select modifi materi enabl effici robust pharmaceut manufactur process commonli identifi factor api particl size small particl size known increas risk process issu drug load formul high drug load allow less opportun mitig poor api properti use excipi next step establish linkag process decis identifi proxi import paramet dose place drug load bc class place particl size api seen like control smaller particl size highli solubl api analysi regulatori file reveal higher dose api associ complex process rout replac proxi factor origin paramet give opportun demonstr stronger trend assumpt test access dataset relat commerci tablet product show dri process larger particl size associ higher achiev drug load determin percol threshold manufactur classif system real world factor influenc manufactur process choic file commerci oral solid dosag formul case studi industri consider continu process

They are particularly useful for paediatric and geriatric patient populations with special needs such as dysphagia, Parkinson's disease, and oral cancer. Accordingly, they hold tremendous potential in gaining patient compliance, convenience and pharmacotherapy. In the present review, conception and evolution of ODFs as a product and its technology are discussed. The review continues by providing overview about the potential of ODFs as carriers for delivering drugs, herbal extracts, probiotics and vaccines.

595,End-to-End Representation Learning for Chemical-Chemical Interaction Prediction.,"Chemical-chemical interaction (CCI) plays a major role in predicting candidate drugs, toxicities, therapeutic effects, and biological functions. CCI is typically inferred from a variety of information; however, CCI has yet not been predicted using a learning-based approach. In other drug analyses, deep learning has been actively used in recent years. However, in most cases, deep learning has been used only for classification even though it has feature extraction capabilities. Thus, in this paper, we propose an end-to-end representation learning method for CCI, named DeepCCI, which includes feature extraction and a learning-based approach. Our proposed architecture is based on the Siamese network. Hidden representations are extracted from a simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES), which is a string notation representing the chemical structure using weight-shared convolutional neural networks. Subsequently, L1 element-wise distances between the two extracted hidden representations are measured. The performance of DeepCCI is compared with those of 12 fingerprint-method combinations. The proposed DeepCCI shows the best performance in most of the evaluation metrics used. In addition, DeepCCI was experimentally validated to guarantee the commutative property. The automatically extracted features can alleviate the efforts required for manual feature engineering and improve prediction performance.",no keywords,Ieee/Acm Transactions On Computational Biology And Bioinformatics,interact cci play major role predict candid drug toxic therapeut effect biolog function cci typic infer varieti inform howev cci yet predict use approach drug analys deep learn activ use recent year howev case deep learn use classif even though featur extract capabl thu paper propos represent learn method cci name deepcci includ featur extract approach propos architectur base siames network hidden represent extract simplifi molecular input line entri system smile string notat repres chemic structur use convolut neural network subsequ distanc two extract hidden represent measur perform deepcci compar combin propos deepcci show best perform evalu metric use addit deepcci experiment valid guarante commut properti automat extract featur allevi effort requir manual featur engin improv predict perform represent learn interact predict

At the beginning lots of works have been done to study various technologies associated with production of drug nanocrystals and their in vitro physical and chemical properties, such as morphology, formulation composition, stabilities, crystalline structure and enhanced solubility and dissolution velocity. Recently, in vivo behaviors of the nanocrystals have been generally studied in animals (including human), and the results proved that drug nanocrystals could be used as a versatile formulation to alter and improve the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and targeting properties of poorly soluble drugs.

597,"Silver nanoparticles: Synthesis, medical applications and biosafety.","Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have been one of the most attractive nanomaterials in biomedicine due to their unique physicochemical properties. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art advances of AgNPs in the synthesis methods, medical applications and biosafety of AgNPs. The synthesis methods of AgNPs include physical, chemical and biological routes. AgNPs are mainly used for antimicrobial and anticancer therapy, and also applied in the promotion of wound repair and bone healing, or as the vaccine adjuvant, anti-diabetic agent and biosensors. This review also summarizes the biological action mechanisms of AgNPs, which mainly involve the release of silver ions (Ag<sup>+</sup>), generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), destruction of membrane structure. Despite these therapeutic benefits, their biological safety problems such as potential toxicity on cells, tissue, and organs should be paid enough attention. Besides, we briefly introduce a new type of Ag particles smaller than AgNPs, silver Ångstrom (Å, 1 Å = 0.1 nm) particles (AgÅPs), which exhibit better biological activity and lower toxicity compared with AgNPs.

598,Variation transmission model for setting acceptance criteria in a multi-staged pharmaceutical manufacturing process.,"Pharmaceutical manufacturing processes consist of a series of stages (e.g., reaction, workup, isolation) to generate the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). Outputs at intermediate stages (in-process control) and API need to be controlled within acceptance criteria to assure final drug product quality. In this paper, two methods based on tolerance interval to derive such acceptance criteria will be evaluated. The first method is serial worst case (SWC), an industry risk minimization strategy, wherein input materials and process parameters of a stage are fixed at their worst-case settings to calculate the maximum level expected from the stage. This maximum output then becomes input to the next stage wherein process parameters are again fixed at worst-case setting. The procedure is serially repeated throughout the process until the final stage. The calculated limits using SWC can be artificially high and may not reflect the actual process performance. The second method is the variation transmission (VT) using autoregressive model, wherein variation transmitted up to a stage is estimated by accounting for the recursive structure of the errors at each stage. Computer simulations at varying extent of variation transmission and process stage variability are performed. For the scenarios tested, VT method is demonstrated to better maintain the simulated confidence level and more precisely estimate the true proportion parameter than SWC. Real data examples are also presented that corroborate the findings from the simulation. Overall, VT is recommended for setting acceptance criteria in a multi-staged pharmaceutical manufacturing process.",no keywords,Aaps Pharmscitech,pharmaceut manufactur process consist seri stage reaction workup isol gener activ pharmaceut ingredi api output intermedi stage control api need control within accept criterion assur final drug product qualiti paper two method base toler interv deriv accept criterion evalu first method serial worst case swc industri risk minim strategi wherein input materi process paramet stage fix set calcul maximum level expect stage maximum output becom input next stage wherein process paramet fix set procedur serial repeat throughout process final stage calcul limit use swc artifici high may reflect actual process perform second method variat transmiss vt use autoregress model wherein variat transmit stage estim account recurs structur error stage comput simul vari extent variat transmiss process stage variabl perform scenario test vt method demonstr better maintain simul confid level precis estim true proport paramet swc real data exampl also present corrobor find simul overal vt recommend set accept criterion pharmaceut manufactur process variat transmiss model set accept criterion pharmaceut manufactur process
599,Designs of clinical swallowability assessments of solid oral dosage forms in regulatory submissions.,"The swallowability of solid oral dosage forms (SODFs) is crucial for medication safety and adherence. Both regulatory agencies and sponsors are concerned with bringing swallowable SODFs to patients. However, no best practices are available for assessing swallowability. Therefore, we conducted a comparative analysis of clinical swallowability assessments (CSAs) for SODFs in regulatory submissions to identify current study design practices. CSAs were identified from a ""swallowability"" keyword search of a Food and Drug Administration database. Notable design trends among the 17 CSAs were not assessing swallowability as a primary endpoint (76 %); enrolling pediatric patients (76 %); administering assessments post-screening (76 %); and utilizing questionnaires (100 %). A design trend with near equal frequency (∼50 %) was single- or multiple-doses of product administration. Study subjects were the primary questionnaire respondents (82 %), usually using a Likert scale (92 %, 12/13). CSAs generally dichotomized the responses for analysis (65 %) without pre-specified threshold values (59 %). Overall, while study designs exhibited trends, methodology variations may impact swallowability measurements affecting the interpretation of results. Thus, developing robust and valid assessment tools for swallowability is imperative to produce clinically relevant data and inform regulatory decision-making. Collaboration between regulatory agencies and sponsors is warranted to create best practices and ensure high quality swallowability data.","clinical assessment, regulatory submission, solid oral dosage form, swallowability",International Journal Of Pharmaceutics,swallow solid oral dosag form sodf crucial medic safeti adher regulatori agenc sponsor concern bring swallow sodf patient howev best practic avail assess swallow therefor conduct compar analysi clinic swallow assess csa sodf regulatori submiss identifi current studi design practic csa identifi swallow keyword search food drug administr databas notabl design trend among csa assess swallow primari endpoint enrol pediatr patient administ assess util questionnair design trend near equal frequenc product administr studi subject primari questionnair respond usual use likert scale csa gener dichotom respons analysi without threshold valu overal studi design exhibit trend methodolog variat may impact swallow measur affect interpret result thu develop robust valid assess tool swallow imper produc clinic relev data inform regulatori collabor regulatori agenc sponsor warrant creat best practic ensur high qualiti swallow data design clinic swallow assess solid oral dosag form regulatori submiss
600,Determination of acidity constants of sparingly soluble drugs in aqueous solution by the internal standard capillary electrophoresis method.,"A set of 33 drugs with different solubilities, ranging from soluble to very insoluble, has been chosen in order to evaluate the performance of the internal standard CE method to determine acidity constants of compounds with limited solubility. The set of drugs tested in this work has been chosen as a function of their intrinsic solubility. For the most insoluble compounds, several analytical conditions to overcome the insolubility in aqueous buffers have been tested. This paper assesses the compound solubility limits for the IS-CE method in aqueous pKa determinations, and also compares the determined pKa s with the results from the literature data obtained by other methods. It is proved that IS-CE method determines acidity constants of sparingly soluble drugs in aqueous media (compounds with logS down to around -6), whereas other reference methods require the use of aqueous-organic solvent buffers and extrapolation procedures to obtain the aqueous pKa for the same compounds.","acidity constant, capillary electrophoresis, internal standard, solubility, pka determination",Electrophoresis,set drug differ solubl rang solubl insolubl chosen order evalu perform intern standard ce method determin acid constant compound limit solubl set drug test work chosen function intrins solubl insolubl compound sever analyt condit overcom insolubl aqueou buffer test paper assess compound solubl limit method aqueou pka determin also compar determin pka result literatur data obtain method prove method determin acid constant sparingli solubl drug aqueou medium compound log around wherea refer method requir use solvent buffer extrapol procedur obtain aqueou pka compound determin acid constant sparingli solubl drug aqueou solut intern standard capillari electrophoresi method

603,A review of drug solubility in human intestinal fluids: implications for the prediction of oral absorption.,"The purpose of this paper is to collate all recently published solubility data of orally administered drugs in human intestinal fluids (HIF) that were aspirated from the upper small intestine (duodenum and jejunum). The data set comprises in total 102 solubility values in fasted state HIF and 37 solubility values in fed state HIF, covering 59 different drugs. Despite differences in the protocol for HIF sampling and subsequent handling, this summary of HIF solubilities provides a critical reference data set to judge the value of simulated media for intestinal solubility estimation. In this regard, the review includes correlations between the reported solubilizing capacity of HIF and fasted or fed state simulated intestinal fluid (FaSSIF/FeSSIF). Correlating with HIF solubilities enables the optimal use of solubility measurements in simulated biorelevant media to obtain accurate estimates of intestinal solubility during drug development. Considering the fraction of poorly soluble new molecular entities in contemporary drug discovery, adequate prediction of intestinal solubility is critical for efficient lead optimization, early candidate profiling, and further development.","duodenal solubility, human intestinal fluid, jejunal solubility, oral absorption, simulated intestinal fluid, solubility",European Journal Of Pharmaceutical Sciences : Official Journal Of The European Federation For Pharmaceutical Sciences,purpos paper collat recent publish solubl data oral administ drug human intestin fluid hif aspir upper small intestin duodenum jejunum data set compris total solubl valu fast state hif solubl valu fed state hif cover differ drug despit differ protocol hif sampl subsequ handl summari hif solubl provid critic refer data set judg valu simul medium intestin solubl estim regard review includ correl report solubil capac hif fast fed state simul intestin fluid correl hif solubl enabl optim use solubl measur simul biorelev medium obtain accur estim intestin solubl drug develop consid fraction poorli solubl new molecular entiti contemporari drug discoveri adequ predict intestin solubl critic effici lead optim earli candid profil develop review drug solubl human intestin fluid implic predict oral absorpt

For this purpose, we employed a high-power NIR time-stretch transmission spectrometer recently developed by us. By using this transmission spectrometer with a multivariate calibration model, we demonstrated the ability to quantify API content with a short measurement time of 3.9 ms per tablet for model pharmaceuticals. For the model tablet, the quantification ability of our spectrometer was comparable to that achieved by a commonly used Fourier-transform NIR (FT-NIR) spectrometer with a measurement time of several seconds. We also confirmed that the effect of irradiating tablets with the NIR pulses used in our spectrometer was negligible.","api content, high-speed measurement, near-infrared spectroscopy, pharmaceutical tablets, time-stretch spectroscopy, transmission spectroscopy",Journal Of Pharmaceutical And Biomedical Analysis,explor feasibl quantif activ pharmaceut ingredi api content tablet product nir spectroscopi improv reliabl pharmaceut purpos employ nir transmiss spectromet recent develop u use transmiss spectromet multivari calibr model demonstr abil quantifi api content short measur time m per tablet model pharmaceut model tablet quantif abil spectromet compar achiev commonli use nir spectromet measur time sever second also confirm effect irradi tablet nir pul use spectromet neglig quantif api content pharmaceut tablet within millisecond transmiss spectroscopi

606,Development of a predictive algorithm for the efficacy of half-life extension strategies.,"A challenge in development of peptide and protein therapeutics is rapid elimination from the body, necessitating frequent dosing that may lead to toxicities and/or poor patient compliance. To solve this issue, there has been great investment into half-life extension of rapidly eliminated drugs using approaches such as albumin binding, fusion to albumin or Fc, or conjugation to polyethylene glycol. Despite clinical successes of half-life extension products, no clear relationship has been drawn between properties of drugs and the pharmacokinetic parameters of their half-life extended analogues. In this study, non-compartmentally derived pharmacokinetic parameters (half-life, clearance, volume of distribution) were collected for 186 half-life extended drugs and their unmodified parent molecules. Statistical testing and regression analysis was performed to evaluate relationships between pharmacokinetic parameters and a matrix of variables. Multivariate linear regression models were developed for each of the three pharmacokinetic parameters and model predictions were in good agreement with observed data with r<sup>2</sup> values for each parameter being: half-life: 0.879, clearance: 0.820, volume of distribution: 0.937. Significant predictors for each parameter included the corresponding pharmacokinetic parameter of the parent drug and descriptors related to molecular weight. This model represents a useful tool for prediction of the potential benefits of half-life extension.","drug delivery, half-life extension, multivariate regression, pharmacokinetics",International Journal Of Pharmaceutics,challeng develop peptid protein therapeut rapid elimin bodi necessit frequent dose may lead toxic poor patient complianc solv issu great invest extens rapidli elimin drug use approach albumin bind fusion albumin fc conjug polyethylen glycol despit clinic success extens product clear relationship drawn properti drug pharmacokinet paramet extend analogu studi deriv pharmacokinet paramet clearanc volum distribut collect extend drug unmodifi parent molecul statist test regress analysi perform evalu relationship pharmacokinet paramet matrix variabl multivari linear regress model develop three pharmacokinet paramet model predict good agreement observ data r sup valu paramet clearanc volum distribut signific predictor paramet includ correspond pharmacokinet paramet parent drug descriptor relat molecular weight model repres use tool predict potenti benefit extens develop predict algorithm efficaci extens strategi
607,Detection and Quantitation of Trace Fentanyl in Heroin by Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy.,"The identification of fentanyl, a main culprit in opioid overdose deaths, has become critical. Whereas Raman spectroscopy is an effective tool for detecting illicit drugs, the weak intensity of Raman scattering can make it difficult to distinguish trace materials. This shortcoming is addressed by surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), which produces strong signal enhancements when target compounds are near metal nanoparticles. This work examines the use of a paper-based substrate impregnated with silver nanoparticles for the detection of trace quantities of fentanyl alone and as an adulterant in heroin. In addition, intensity ratios of diagnostic peaks associated with each substance were fitted to a Langmuir isotherm calibration model and used for the quantitative analysis of fentanyl in heroin mixtures. Linearity was observed at <6% fentanyl, a significant finding that is consistent with concentrations found in drugs seized during law enforcement efforts. In addition, swabbing with these paper-based SERS substrates facilitated the recovery of fentanyl from surfaces, showing this to be applicable for crime scene investigations. However, assessment using the calibration model proved difficult for swabbed samples.

However, its feasibility in the quantification of pulmonary drug deposition has not been investigated. In this study, an optically accessible airway model of the upper airway and the tracheobronchial tree was used, and experiments were performed at flow rates of 40 L/min, 60 L/min and 80 L/min. Drug deposition in different regions of the airway cast has been determined and quantified from OCT images of the deposition layer. Regionally resolved measurement of deposition shows that flow rate has a significant effect (p = 0.04) on the average thickness of the deposition layer in the upper airway but not in the tracheobronchial tree under these test conditions. These localized and high-resolution measurements of deposition also demonstrate that the flow rate can influence the spatial uniformity of the deposition layer. The technique is able to provide significant regional drug deposition details, including the thickness, spatial deposition pattern and micro-cavities in the deposition layer, that would potentially serve to assess the efficacy of inhalation drug delivery systems.","deposition profile, drug deposition, non-intrusive measurement, optical coherence tomography, realistic airway",International Journal Of Pharmaceutics,optic coher tomographi oct imag techniqu mainli use medic imag industri test howev feasibl quantif pulmonari drug deposit investig studi optic access airway model upper airway tracheobronchi tree use experi perform flow rate drug deposit differ region airway cast determin quantifi oct imag deposit layer region resolv measur deposit show flow rate signific effect p averag thick deposit layer upper airway tracheobronchi tree test condit local measur deposit also demonstr flow rate influenc spatial uniform deposit layer techniqu abl provid signific region drug deposit detail includ thick spatial deposit pattern deposit layer would potenti serv assess efficaci inhal drug deliveri system high resolut measur region drug powder deposit
609,Effectiveness of an electronic inpatient medication record in reducing medication errors in Singapore.,"This study examined the effectiveness of an inpatient electronic medication record system in reducing medication errors in Singaporean hospitals. This pre- and post-intervention study involving a control group was undertaken in two Singaporean acute care hospitals. In one hospital the inpatient electronic medication record system was implemented while in another hospital the paper-based medication record system was used. The mean incidence difference in medication errors of 0.06 between pre-intervention (0.72 per 1000 patient days) and post-intervention (0.78 per 1000 patient days) for the two hospitals was not statistically significant (95%, CI: [0.26, 0.20]). The mean incidence differences in medication errors relating to prescription, dispensing, and administration were also not statistically different. Common system failures involved a lack of medication knowledge by health professionals and a lack of a systematic approach in identifying correct dosages. There was no difference in the incidence of medication errors following the introduction of the electronic medication record system. More work is needed on how this system can reduce medication error rates and improve medication safety.","doctors, electronic medication record, medication errors, nurses, patient safety, pharmacists",Nursing & Health Sciences,studi examin effect inpati electron medic record system reduc medic error singaporean hospit studi involv control group undertaken two singaporean acut care hospit one hospit inpati electron medic record system implement anoth hospit medic record system use mean incid differ medic error per patient day per patient day two hospit statist signific ci mean incid differ medic error relat prescript dispens administr also statist differ common system failur involv lack medic knowledg health profession lack systemat approach identifi correct dosag differ incid medic error follow introduct electron medic record system work need system reduc medic error rate improv medic safeti effect electron inpati medic record reduc medic error singapor

611,Opening doors with ultrasound and microbubbles: Beating biological barriers to promote drug delivery.,"Apart from its clinical use in imaging, ultrasound has been thoroughly investigated as a tool to enhance drug delivery in a wide variety of applications. Therapeutic ultrasound, as such or combined with cavitating nuclei or microbubbles, has been explored to cross or permeabilize different biological barriers. This ability to access otherwise impermeable tissues in the body makes the combination of ultrasound and therapeutics very appealing to enhance drug delivery in situ. This review gives an overview of the most important biological barriers that can be tackled using ultrasound and aims to provide insight on how ultrasound has shown to improve accessibility as well as the biggest hurdles. In addition, we discuss the clinical applicability of therapeutic ultrasound with respect to the main challenges that must be addressed to enable the further progression of therapeutic ultrasound towards an effective, safe and easy-to-use treatment tailored for drug delivery in patients.","blood-brain barrier, cavitation nuclei, cellular bioeffects, immunotherapy, sonoporation, tight junctions, tumor therapy",Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews,apart clinic use imag ultrasound thoroughli investig tool enhanc drug deliveri wide varieti applic therapeut ultrasound combin cavit nucleus microbubbl explor cross permeabil differ biolog barrier abil access otherwis imperm tissu bodi make combin ultrasound therapeut appeal enhanc drug deliveri situ review give overview import biolog barrier tackl use ultrasound aim provid insight ultrasound shown improv access well biggest hurdl addit discus clinic applic therapeut ultrasound respect main challeng must address enabl progress therapeut ultrasound toward effect safe treatment tailor drug deliveri patient open door ultrasound microbubbl beat biolog barrier promot drug deliveri
